            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="26.663" offset="106580">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.447" offset="113685">The issue in this case here on a petition for certiorari to the Fifth Circuit is whether under the Federal Alcohol Administration Act it's illegal for a wholesaler of alcoholic beverages to engage in so-called tie-in sales with a retailer.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.055" offset="180140">That is sales under which the wholesaler requires the retailer as a condition to obtaining wanted items in alcoholic beverages to purchase unwanted items.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.569" offset="226220">The Federal Alcohol Administration Act contains a system of permits for wholesalers under which a wholesaler cannot operate in interstate commerce without a permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.207" offset="268748">The Secretary of the Treasury is given authority to suspend permits under a statutory provision which makes compliance with certain provisions of the Act including the provisions I shall discuss in a moment, a condition of the permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.606" offset="326322">The petitioner in this case is the Assistant Regional Commissioner to whom the Secretary of the Treasury has delegated authority to suspend basic permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.496" offset="365923">The respondent is a large wholesaler in the New Orleans area who is the exclusive distributor of Seagram's product in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.008" offset="403958">The Assistant Regional Commissioner, through a hearing exam, conducted a full administrative proceeding, the culmination of which was that he found that the respondent had engaged in tie-in sales and that he had required a number of retailers to purchase at a condition to getting two scarce items which were Seagram's V.O.Canadian Whiskey and Seagram's Johnny Walker Scotch.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.996" offset="511896">Two items which is found were either not wanted or were in long supply, namely Seagram's Ancient Bottle Gin and Seagram's 7-Crown Whiskey, blended whisky.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.432" offset="577724">He ultimately imposed a 15-day suspension of the respondent's permit for violations of Section 5 (a) and 5 (b) of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.009" offset="624013">The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, without reaching any of the other contentions which the respondent had presented to the Court, set the suspension order aside on the ground that this statute does not prohibit the making of tie-in sale and reaching that result, it recognized that it was disagreeing with a contrary decision of the Court of Appeals in the Second Circuit in a case entitled Distilled Brands v.Dunigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.278" offset="729025">The statutory provisions involved in this case is set forth at pages 2 and 3 of the Government's brief and a section of the Act, Section 5 which it had an unfair competition and unlawful practices and this section makes it unlawful for a wholesaler to require by agreement or otherwise that any retailer engaged in the sale of distilled spirits purchased any such products from such person, I'd like to emphasize this, to the exclusion in whole or in part, in whole or in part of distilled spirits sold or off it was sale by other persons in interstate or foreign commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.206" offset="912823">Our basic position in this case is that the tie-in sale under which a wholesaler requires a retailer to take an unwanted product as a condition of obtaining a wanted product excludes in part the tied product, the unwanted product which is sold or offered for sale by other wholesalers of alcoholic beverages.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.025" offset="1012088">Now in this case, the record shows that some of the retailers, who testified, stated explicitly that if they had not been required to purchase certain tied products from the respondent, they would have purchased other brands of these products.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.878" offset="1079484">So there is explicit evidence here and the hearing examiner so found that there is exclusion of the tied products.</text>

          <turn speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="302.656" stopTime="715.031">
            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="302.656" offset="1210619">It was this particular brand.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.590" offset="1218351">It was just the Seagram's Gin which it was testified it was more expensive amount of popular gin.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.399" offset="1241548">Now, by similar reasoning we think that these practices also violates Section 5 (b) (7) of the Act which required -- prohibits a wholesaler from inducing any retailer to purchase distilled spirits from him to the exclusion in whole or in part by requiring the retailer to just take and dispose off a quota of any such product and similarly in this case, there was a showing that certain quotas was set up in order to get five bottles of one thing, he had to buy ten of another, that kind of quota.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.446" offset="1373727">The Court of Appeals, and we think without analysis of this precise legislative -- precise language, suggested that the statute does not apply to tie-in sales for the following reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.230" offset="1432869">It stated that this statute grew out of the NRA “code of fair competition” of the alcoholic beverage industry, that under the code, tie-in sales were not prohibited and that this statute is nothing more or less than a reenactment of certain of the code provisions and therefore the failure in specific terms to outlaw a tie-in sale precludes the statute's application to this practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.811" offset="1539239">Now in considering this contention, we think it's important to indicate briefly what the codes purported to do and what we think are very significant changes which the statute made in the code.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.087" offset="1588245">We strongly disagree with the view of the Court of Appeals that all of these statute represented a reenactment of the code provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.291" offset="1621159">The codes were drafted shortly after prohibition was repealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.036" offset="1648118">At that time, Congress was not in session and the NRA program had just been set up in a series of codes of the various phases of the alcoholic beverage industry were promulgated.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.889" offset="1691481">We have set forth in our brief at pages 27 to 30, one of the particular code provisions which we think is significant in the wholesaler's code and this code have a large number of provisions dealing with unfair methods of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.493" offset="1757936">Section 8 of the code which is set forth at 20, page 29 of our brief purported to regulate control of retail outlets which in a sense is similar to the provisions dealing with tied hazards in Section 5 (b) and Section 11 of the code captioned exclusive outlets, purports to be the counterpart of the present Section 5 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="462.367" offset="1849365">But these provisions dealing with exclusive outlets and control of retail outlets were very limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.434" offset="1873711">In the first place, they apply only to sales by retailers for consumption on the premise as the bar, cocktail lounge and saloon.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.959" offset="1907775">They did not purport to prohibit these practices by a wholesaler in dealing with the so-called package store.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.791" offset="1935151">Secondly, they're just blanket prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.653" offset="1946540">There is no reference in this particular provision to any of the competitive effects of the practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.216" offset="1972767">But when Congress came to deal with the problem in the Federal Alcohol Administration Act after this Court had invalidated the NRA in (Inaudible) case, it substantially broadened these provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.832" offset="2023236">In the first place, it extended the prohibitions not from the whole -- the retailer on the premises but the man who also sold in a package store.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.929" offset="2063673">But more significantly, it injected a new element, we think, into the concept of violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.476" offset="2085825">That is the competitive effect of these practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.135" offset="2104529">The statutes initially, the code rather had merely prohibited exclusive sell -- selling in -- in a way that require him to handle only the product of a particular wholesaler.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.754" offset="2154998">This was broadened in the statute to cover sales which result in the exclusion in whole or in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.165" offset="2188643">The significant fact that the Congress injected into these statute was that it excluded in whole or in part products sold by other persons, product sold by competitors of a wholesaler.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.123" offset="2240470">The same language is found in Section 5 (b) of the Act and also in Section (5) (c) of the Act which prohibits commercial bribery.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.049" offset="2268160">All three Sections require as an element of violation, a significant element that the effect of this be to exclude in whole or in part products offered for sale by competing wholesaler.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.259" offset="2316957">And indeed, Congress put in another provision in the statute in Section 8 which prohibits interlocking directives between various distillers in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.505" offset="2353946">It's prohibited unless the holder of the directive is able to make an affirmative showing that will tend to interfere with competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.043" offset="2392085">The reason we believe that these provisions were injected into the statute is reflected in the legislative history which we will prefer to you briefly on page 20 of our brief which Congress indicated what it was seeking to do in these prohibitions under Section 5 on unfair methods of competition was to prohibit practices which tended to produce monopolistic control of retail outlets and it sought to strike at the incipiency of monopolies and such restraints.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.645" offset="2514547">And it further stated in discussing Section 5 that the practices condemned in that section are analogous to those prohibited by the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.942" offset="2563762">Tie-in agreements as this Court has stated in (Inaudible) case have always paired harshly under the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.161" offset="2600542">This Court has also pointed out that they serve no purpose other than the suppression of competition and we all think there can be any question but a tie-in practice under which a wholesaler requires a retailer to purchase unwanted products as a condition to buying scarce products as designed only for the purpose of forcing on the retailer the particular product which he would not otherwise buy.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.769" offset="2703047">In the Distilled Brands case, Judge Clark speaking for a unanimous Court in upholding the application of the statute to prohibit tie-in sales pointed out that these sales have a double effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.549" offset="2750171">In the first place, they force the retailer to purchase unwanted products.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.395" offset="2773577">The record shows in this case that two of the retailer witnesses testified that at the time of the hearing, 16 months after these tie-in practices had occurred, they still had on their shelves some of the items which they have been forced to take on a tied basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.426" offset="2853616">The second element which Judge Clark point --</text>

            <text syncTime="735.673" offset="2942642">It is a narrow concept but believe it embodied at least in the area of tie-in sale in view of this broad language, the basic concept which this Court has developed with respect to clients.</text>

            <text syncTime="751.528" offset="3006067">Then the other effect is the exclusionary effect on the competing sellers of products.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.502" offset="3025920">Now, this view and I'd also point out that tie-in sales do violate the Act, is the view that the Alcohol Administration has had since 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.519" offset="3086002">In that year, it brought 146 proceedings against virtually the entire wholesale industry based on tie-in practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.044" offset="3120170">The Court of Appeals recognized this administrative instruction but founded unpersuasive because it said in 1947, the acting Secretary of the Treasury had recommended to Congress that the statute be amended specifically to prohibit tie-in sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.973" offset="3195820">And in that letter which is set out at pages 31 to 35 of our -- 36 of our brief, there is some statement that the Court construed as doubt by the administrative agency as to validity of its construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.508" offset="3265933">And therefore it said since the administrative agency had doubt as to the correctness of its interpretation, that interpretation is not very persuasive.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.913" offset="3299579">Well, I think the letter shows that the doubt they had was not a doubt as to the correctness of their construction of the statute, but rather a doubt as to whether in view of the repeated position taken by the industry that tie-in sales are not prohibited whether in subsequent proceedings the statute would be held to prohibit tie-in sales and they therefore pointed out that instead of bringing criminal proceedings for these violations, they elected to institute civil proceedings which were subsequently settled by stipulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.985" offset="3439909">In 1946 and 1947, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue reported to the Secretary of the Treasury that he did construe the Act as covering tie-in sales that it's unequivocally without any doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.179" offset="3516709">Furthermore, the mere fact that a bill has been introduced in Congress without any further congressional proceeding other than referring the bill to a committee, this Court had pointed out, does not indicate the Congress in any way acquiesces in the view that the statute as presently written does not cover the practice which the bill was designed to change.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.175" offset="3612630">The Court of Appeals also placed considerable reliance on the fact that these provisions have the captions, exclusive outlets and tied house which it read as limiting the proper scope of the provision and therefore they said that, since the tied sale is neither an exclusive outlet or a near exclusive dealing on a tied house, this thing does not come within the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.528" offset="3734047">Well, once again, we recognize that the headings of Sections are of course entitled to weigh and construing them.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.403" offset="3761528">On the other hand, the exclusive outlet section seems to be merely a repetition of what was in the code.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.589" offset="3810325">These particular captions were not the subject of any congressional debated and we think they're merely a shorthand method of covering what is the general subject and in the light of the specific language in here providing for exclusion in whole or in part, we don't think that the caption can fairly be read as limiting the particular language.</text>

            <text syncTime="1022.044" offset="4088163">I don't know Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.439" offset="4097672">Those are all provisions which maybe the way in which you can control such as giving signs, such as obtaining an interest in the license and interest in real estate, giving very successive things and so on -- guaranteeing loans and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.713" offset="4162769">We don't claim that there is any particular provision, which would not be covered by tied house.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.124" offset="4184398">We do claim that tied house doesn't limit it and that this particular type of practice which is the kind of thing that could lead to a tied house was broadened up and was contemplated by Congress if the statute is broadly grown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.493" offset="4257959">My opponent will undoubtedly refer in considerable detail to the fact that at the time that this statute was passed, the tie -- the tie-in sale was not then known as a particularly -- as a practice engaged in by the alcoholic beverage industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.155" offset="4336536">The reason of course to that is that by its very nature, a tie-in sale can only exist in the time of scarcity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.050" offset="4364121">The only time you can get sufficient leverage to force a person to take something he doesn't want is when you have scarce commodity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.764" offset="4395050">But that frankly, we don't think justifies the restrictive construction of this Act by the Court of Appeals because the language is broad and we think the legislative history does show a broad purpose on the part of Congress to condemn as it said, practices analogous to those prohibited in the antitrust laws and to strike at the strengths of trade and monopolies in their incipiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.325" offset="4497241">And I would like to read to the Court just a few words what this Court said in the Joiner case as to the construction to be given to statutes which provides for a regulatory pattern even though the violation of the statute may also be a crime as it's true in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.978" offset="4571847">The Court said that the courts will interpret the text so far as the meaning of the words fairly permit so as to carry out in particular cases the generally expressed legislative policy and we believe that construing this language is broad enough to cover tie-in sales does carry out that general legislative policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1180.730" offset="4722834">It is very apparent and the Court will see it as we proceed that it couldn't be a more varied opinion or at more opposite end to many pole as my good friend Mr. Friedman and I as to the construction of the statute and as to the interpretation of the two decisions which have resulted in the matter being before you today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.627" offset="4822413">We are agreed specifically, however, in their brief and in ours on one matter and that is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.893" offset="4855536">The statute in its very language does not prohibit tie-in sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.288" offset="4881136">That it is necessary that a broad interpretation at the Second Circuit said in the Distilled Brands case, it is necessary that a broad interpretation be applied to the statute before it can be applied to the practice of tie-in sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.139" offset="4972460">The Second Circuit based its decision on two major premises that tie-in sales being reprobated generally under the antitrust laws and affecting commerce were therefore reprobated under this statute because the Treasury Department had a contemporaneous and consistent interpretation of the statute to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.589" offset="5106312">The Fifth Circuit said, however, the Second Circuit was justified in its decision in the facts before it but the Second Circuit did not have before it matters which are before us and those are matters that relate to, first, the congressional intent and secondly to the administrative interpretation of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.651" offset="5218534">The Fifth Circuit said that we will not read this statute broadly because it appears to us that Congress did not contemplate tie-in sales and that there is nothing in the administrative determination to support the decision in the Distilled Brands case because it did not have before it a very important letter, written to the Congress of the United States by the acting president or acting Secretary of the Treasury, a letter which naturally the government has sought to slur over and to deprecate but which is very important in the consideration of this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1381.471" offset="5525838">This letter is important to us because of the argument which has been made by counsel that in 1946, some 146 suspension orders were issued based on tie-in sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.160" offset="5600549">In the Treasury's own language, there was no problem apparently of tie-in sales until 1946 at which time it issued show cause orders to a great number of retailers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.818" offset="5659272">Those show cause orders were dismissed, dismissed on a stipulation and it is interesting to note that in our case, the stipulation said in no uncertain terms that it was not to be used to the prejudice of the parties to the stipulation in any other legal proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.272" offset="5745058">Immediately, after this stipulation, they addressed this letter to Congress and they said, we interpret this statute to apply the tie-in sale but we have doubt whether we can sustain our interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.270" offset="5821022">Furthermore, the industry says that the statute applies to exclusive outlets and tied houses and therefore we asked the Congress to clarify this and to put in Section 5 (c) of the Act precise language defining a tie-in sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.803" offset="5911197">On two subsequent occasions, the Treasury Department sought again to introduce legislation specifically reprobating and prohibiting tie-in sales and on every occasion those fail.</text>

            <text syncTime="1518.995" offset="6075977">The list I get out of the letter is that the decision say that the Court may, if it will, give weight to a contemporaneous and a consistent administrative policy and the Distilled Brands case found that there was such a contemporaneous consistent policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.289" offset="6165107">But here, the department comes along and says, first, it wasn't contemporaneous because we didn't make an interpretation of the statute to apply the tie-in sales until 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.147" offset="6216516">The statute was enacted in the 1930s.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.982" offset="6227905">Secondly, it says, we have doubt whether we can successfully enforce the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.477" offset="6253819">I believe that -- that should negate the position that the Treasury Department had a consistent and a contemporaneous policy which would support a Court's interpretation of the statute and that therefore the Fifth Circuit was correct in not following the administrative interpretation but applying the only white light of its own inquiry into the meaning of the statute based upon the congressional reports and the very language itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.195" offset="6392686">And I submit to the Court that on page 10 of our brief, we have set out the two provisions which the Government seeks to enforce in this case and we have set out a definition of tie-in sales and I submit that you will find that they are synonymous and that a very broad interpretation of the language must take place to include the offense of a tie-in sale and to even a partial exclusive outlet or a partial tied house.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.599" offset="6550361">In addition to the position in that regard, may I point this out to the Court also a factor which I think is also pointed up in the Distilled Brands case and by the Government in its argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.500" offset="6605949">And that is the idea of a requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.948" offset="6623713">Section 5 (a) says that where a wholesaler requires a retail to take his product in exclusion of others whether it is in whole or in part, referring to the concept of an exclusive outlet which Congress said was bringing about certain social as well as the Treasury Department (Inaudible) where the wholesaler dominated the retailer so that he took all his particular product to all of his particular wine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.577" offset="6758296">There is no such requirement in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.517" offset="6773969">There is nothing alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.373" offset="6781492">There is nothing proven that the wholesaler and the retailer in this case, the wholesaler required the retailer in this case to do anything whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.714" offset="6826841">The entire proof in the entire allegation is that the wholesaler said to the retailer, if you want my scarce item, you can't have it alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.169" offset="6868637">You have to have some of my other products to merit my scarce items if you want blended whisky in the form of 7-Crown or if you want gin, you may have it along with the item.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.556" offset="6918165">But at no time and it certainly isn't contended by the government at no time did the wholesaler say to the retailer, if you don't buy my V.O. and you don't buy my 7-Crown, you can't buy from me at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.678" offset="6974694">You must buy from me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.540" offset="6986083">The wholesaler at all times was willing to sell the items that were in common demand and in supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.615" offset="7022446">The wholesaler would have sold the 7-Crown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.330" offset="7033313">The wholesaler would have sold the gin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.224" offset="7040836">The wholesaler in this case as it's pointed out in the record, carry some 40 or 50 brands of other items, anything could have been purchased except for the retailer to merit items in short supply in the language of the wholesale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.264" offset="7113038">He had to have a reasonable purchasing record and in this case, these men said, we knew we had to buy other products and so we bought them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.845" offset="7155357">One of the host -- the retailer said, we knew that it was our obligation to buy the entire line and at no time anywhere in this record do you find any wholesaler saying any retailer saying that I am dominated by, I am controlled by or I am even influenced by this wholesaler.</text>

            <text syncTime="2204.824" offset="8819252">In the first place, the tied house provision in its other phases such signs and commercial bribery, relate rather to something which the wholesaler is giving to the retailer to induce him, to prejudice him, to affect him in some way, to bribe him in other words because it's called a commercial bribery statute generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.026" offset="8916010">But the -- the tied house idea relates to a quota.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.792" offset="8939102">It relates to the idea that you must take 25% of your blended whisky from us.</text>

            <text syncTime="2243.549" offset="8974106">It talks about a quota in the very provision applied to this case by requiring him to take a quota.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.730" offset="9002841">There is no requirement in this case argued I'm sure that anyone attempted to force a quota and I recall in the argument that counsel made that -- an attempt was made to prove a pattern that you had to take so many cases of one to get to other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.129" offset="9080477">I might point out that the Fifth Circuit found that that was absurd.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.478" offset="9101897">The Fifth Circuit, if you will bear with me while I read what it finds as a matter of fact, found that the investigator testified that in his effort to ascertain whether appellant tying V.O. with gin and other products.</text>

            <text syncTime="2298.931" offset="9195624">He just went out and picked isolated ideas to prove a pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.951" offset="9215791">In other words, to prove a quota, to prove a relationship but there is nothing whatsoever in the record to show that there was any quota.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.365" offset="9257378">And I submit that if we went in to this man and said, you must purchase all of your blended whisky from us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.039" offset="9300114">That is a violation of Section 5 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.221" offset="9312862">If we went to him and said, we don't care what you buy from us but you must buy 15% of your product from us or you must buy 5% of your product or you must buy a quota from us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.041" offset="9368137">We would violate Section 5 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.468" offset="9381825">But what we are accused up of saying to this man in this case is not a tie-in agreement of our gasoline to our pumps or our IBM cards to machines over a long course of time related to a monopolized product which we had a complete control as in the IBM case but we're merely accused of saying to these people in a time which the government recognized is a time of scarcity that you can't just purchase from us only of our scarce product.</text>

            <text syncTime="2403.013" offset="9612016">We have no dominance over this retailer.</text>

            <text syncTime="2407.722" offset="9630824">He can do exactly as one of the men in this case did.</text>

            <text syncTime="2417.337" offset="9669277">There's no dominance and that leads me frankly into the major reason we believe that Section 5 (a) and 5 (b) do not apply to a tie-in sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.316" offset="9725179">It is pointed out in both of our briefs that under the Times-Picayune case which summarized the jurisprudence on tie-in agreements that the major reason that tying agreements are reprobated is because of their effect on commerce that they do affect commerce, that they reduce competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.360" offset="9829355">If you will read these congressional reports at least as we see them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.510" offset="9845969">We submit that the congressional report and the purpose of the statute was not to set up along with the antitrust statute in the Clayton Act and the Robinson-Patman Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act, another broad concept of unfair competition but rather a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.721" offset="9922873">The purpose of which was to govern the relationship between the wholesaler and the retailer in a very limited industry, the alcoholic beverage industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.152" offset="9968536">The purpose of the statute was aimed at very items which existed before prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.041" offset="10012108">The reports say that that is the purpose of the statute, to enact as much of the codes as it could.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.433" offset="10045649">We grant that the statute went beyond the code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.784" offset="10059128">We grant that it says in whole or in part but we don't believe that, such action takes it from the very purpose of the statute which was to govern the beverage industry, the relationship of the wholesaler and the retailer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.724" offset="10130808">Now if that is the rationale of the statute, the decisions of this Court in the tying agreement say that the effect of a tie-in sale as between the two parties not on the question of commerce but on the two parties is solely to abridge the judgment of the purchaser as to the tied product.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.702" offset="10218789">The Court would have to say then that this abridgement in isolated cases in a particular period of time was such an action of domination and control by a wholesaler over a retailer that it was an incipient tendency to a monopoly in order for it to meet the purpose of the statute as we see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.145" offset="10328503">And we submit, if the Court please, that that is not the case here, that there is no evidence whatsoever and I don't think it's contended or urged if there was any domination or control or monopolistic tendency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.794" offset="10387122">The contention is that you cannot have a tie-in sale because it is assumed and is particularly assumed by the Second Circuit that every tie-in sale excludes the purchase of another item.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.250" offset="10452950">This record is absolute proof that you can't make such an assumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.545" offset="10474162">One of the wholesaler said as Mr. Friedman point out, all this meant to me was that I bought a large quantity now and I kept it here until I sold it but I bought everything else that I needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.152" offset="10528601">The other one said, I continued to buy all of the other products that I had to buy that I wasn't stopped from buying other gins when I bought Seagram's V.O.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.793" offset="10595161">The other one said, I understood this as a concept of a sales practice to put on the market all brands through a retail but it didn't stop me from buying anything from anyone else and you will find that the major competitors name time and time again throughout the record show, came in and said, they sold everything they have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.974" offset="10683873">Every item they had, they sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.683" offset="10702681">So the basic assumption that a tie-in sale of necessity excludes another sale is not basic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.555" offset="10738207">It is not sound because the tie-in sale may only result in lesser purchases of the same wholesaler over a longer period of time.</text>

            <text syncTime="2736.713" offset="10946769">We believe we urged that to the Fifth Circuit also and that is -- they would consider if this case were remanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.537" offset="10974145">But what I am saying is that preadmitting that as a question of fact in this case, as a holding by the Court in this case that those facts that appear in the record, and which I've cited to this Court in our footnote, are an effective rebuttal to saying that it is a legal assumption that if I buy one product, I have necessity exclude and prevent the sale of another because as a practical matter, it isn't correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.074" offset="11100264">By way of summary, may I point out that it has been the continuous contention in this case that the statute should be read in the light of its exact language in applying to an exclusive outlet and a tied house that although Congress knew as a result of the Federal Trade Commission case versus (Inaudible) that there was such thing as tie-in sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.127" offset="11220428">They had no time included them specifically in the statute when it was enacted that the Treasury Department, which was the author of this legislation did not include it and in its letter has said it had doubts as to whether it was included.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.887" offset="11311543">The three occasions before Congress, an amendment has been introduced to amend the statute.All of which have proved a point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.928" offset="11359608">The Fifth Circuit said, considering the nature of the statute, considering the titles, considering the fact that this is dealing with property rights which are going to be taken away as a result of its enforcement as well as the possibility of criminal proceeding, we do not believe that a broad interpretation of the statute should be made for such a broad interpretation in our eyes, makes a permittee act at its peril in almost all of its actions.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="2977.146" offset="11908493">Most of Mr. Steeg's arguments, seem to me relate to questions which are before the Court of Appeals in which the Court of Appeals found it unnecessary to raise such as the substantiality of the act on interstate commerce whether in fact it proves a sufficient volumes of tie-in sales that the question brought to this Court by the government on the writ of certiorari and the question is to which there is a conflict between the Circuits, is whether this statute covers tie-in sales as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.142" offset="12040568">And we think from the statute says to require a retailer to purchase such products, and such person to the exclusion in whole or in part of distilled spirits sold or offered for sale by other persons in interstate commerce, that language does cover tie-in sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.673" offset="12106606">Now, one thing I might mention on the interstate commerce point is that the examiner did find that the competing products, many of which was said to have been actually excluded in the sense that retailers have purchased on a tied basis, will not or therefore did not purchase the other product were found to have come in to the State of Louisiana in interstate commerce and the examiner found there is no registered distillery in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.940" offset="12215693">And one final point that Mr. Steeg made that he seem to suggest that because there is nothing done from 1946 to 1952, the administrative agency didn't have much faith in its interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.171" offset="12268669">Well, to begin with, in 1946, the entire industry had entered into a consensus stipulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.896" offset="12295523">Secondly, as pretty well recognized, tie-in sales become a serious problem only in times of scarcity and there was the immediate post war scarcity, then liquor became more plentiful and it was only in the advent of the Korean emergency that the scarcity is again developing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.760" offset="12366994">As soon as that happened, there was this case, there was the Distilled Brands case and there was a third case referred to in our brief which we settle by stipulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.822" offset="12399282">We submit to the Court that the administrative interpretation has been consisted that the administration has never conceded any doubt on its part as to the correctness of this instruction and that this self administrative interpretation reinforced us and serves to emphasize the correctness of the basic statutory view that a tie-in sale is prohibited because it excludes in part distilled spirit sale -- sold or offered for sale by other persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.498" offset="12509936">Thank you.</text>
