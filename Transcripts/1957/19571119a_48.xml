          <turn speaker="j_h_highsmith" startTime="10.705" stopTime="347.224">
            <label>Mr. J. H. Highsmith</label>
            <text syncTime="10.705" offset="42736">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.952" offset="55798">I had discussed briefly yesterday afternoon the jurisdictional question involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.403" offset="89548">I'd move on now to the other features of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.366" offset="113371">Under the facts of this case as they are in the record we think in fact with respect to the ordinance that actually only the two first sections are involved because the appellant made no application for a license and that is really the only two sections that have been applied to appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.151" offset="240536">It's somewhat similar or it's an ordinance consisting of nine separate sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.091" offset="264359">It specifically provides that the invalidity of anyone of those sections will not invalidate the ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.655" offset="302602">Now, it is somewhat similar, to my mind, as was the matter in the case of Harriss involving the Federal Regulation of Lobbying Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.665" offset="350563">It will be recalled that in that case, the appellant made the contention that the provision of that Act that said that anyone convicted of the Act of a violation of the Act could not petition the Government or could not engage in lobbying for a period of three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.719" offset="446798">The Court held that it wasn't necessary to pass on that feature of it that that section hadn't been attempted to be applied and therefore, it wasn't before the Court and it would be taken up in such time as it did become before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.616" offset="514403">And the same situation exists here because these two sections say that before soliciting a person for a membership in a society that requires the payments of dues, it involved the money matter that they shall make the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.671" offset="602593">Actually, that section does not require a permit as their writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.928" offset="623700">It says that they shall have to make the application first.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.523" offset="638015">A subsequent section does say, of course, that they don't obtain the permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.336" offset="661316">Well, then, they could be prosecuted under the criminal section.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.431" offset="681691">This, to my mind, is the issue that has been so recently before this Court that it doesn't need to be dwelled on at any great length.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.047" offset="736131">It is strictly within the ruling of the Court under the case, the Thomas case, where a similar registration was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.714" offset="786808">And the Court, of course, in that decision, restricted itself to the fact that the injunction granted did prohibit the union from having the right of free bargaining because that -- no, I'm mistaken to hear the case, did prevent freedom of speech because the man could not make a speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.339" offset="873326">And it held here and we do rely strictly on this part of the decision, it said once a speaker goes further high up and engages in conduct which amount to more than the right of free discussion comprehends as when he undertakes collections of funds or securing subscriptions, he enters the realm when reasonable restriction or identification requirements may be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.146" offset="984503">Now, that is what we contend here.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.826" offset="999236">That under the facts of the case, this was a paid organized pursuing their vocation of an organizer and soliciting money, not just talking about the rights of labor or the benefits of labor but soliciting money.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.977" offset="1079902">And under that direct ruling in the Thomas case, we say -- say that this matter should be held valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.523" offset="1114070">Now, appellant has said it would be an undue hardship on labor to be required to meet what might be various regulations in various municipalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.435" offset="1169659">Well, I think we are exposed to the same thing in any profession or vocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.513" offset="1194005">As a lawyer, if I practice in different States, I have to get a license in each State.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.823" offset="1215216">And if I practice before different courts, I have to get a license from each court.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.619" offset="1234442">And that hasn't proved any undue hardship as far as the bar is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.451" offset="1253773">The same thing is true with respect to medicine.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.745" offset="1266939">They have to comply with the regulations of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.438" offset="1281672">That regulates their vocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.798" offset="1295151">Now, if this is a restraint upon the freedom of speech, if it comes within that domain, then all of appellant's contentions are applicable because it would be a previous restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.960" offset="1367771">It would be an invalid restraint if it is within that domain.</text>

            <text syncTime="443.462" offset="1773819">If it was invalid and if it -- I agree that it is invalid, then the Court would suppose that the officer would not enforce an invalid section.</text>

            <text syncTime="821.388" offset="3285473">I want to say that as we view it, this ordinance is independently invalid on two basic grounds under the First Amendment, the first being that it leaves to the city authorities the power to grant or deny licenses on discretionary ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.865" offset="3371363">And we say that the First Amendment forbids that kind of a requirement where elementary rights of speech and association are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.973" offset="3419847">The second, an independent ground for our attack under the First Amendment, is that the imposition of any flat license tax is invalid under the decisions of this Court in the Murdock case and the Opelika case and Follett against McCormick and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.964" offset="3491840">So that, these are our two basic premises.</text>
