            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">Number 561, Bart Luis Caritativo, Petitioner, versus People of the State of California.</text>

            <label>Mr. George T. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="16.479" offset="65829">May it please the Court, and counsel at the counsel table.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.214" offset="92787">This case involves the two questions which have arisen in connection with the trial of a man named Bart Luis Caritativo.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.819" offset="159242">Both of these questions have to do with a question of due process in the application of certain California statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.385" offset="201456">Statutes are different and I think that if I could make a thumbnail statement about the facts of the case I will bring the questions to the Court's attention most quickly and more to the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.797" offset="255164">Caritativo was arrested in Marin County which is a suburb of San Francisco and charged with murder, the murder of two people.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.341" offset="305319">He was arrested sometime in late 1954 and he was brought to trial in January of 1955 before a superior court judge with a duly impaneled jury and at that time he had two lawyers who were representing him and under California law which requires that if you are going to enter a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity that must be a separate plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.148" offset="412526">There are two pleas that must be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.613" offset="422452">This man had only entered by and through his lawyers a plea of not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.076" offset="448261">Now, an unusual thing happened in this case pretty much without precedent in many respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.691" offset="482743">On the second day of the trial after witnesses had testified for the prosecution, Mr. Caritativo unexpectedly to all concerned got up in the courtroom and made a statement that he wanted to change lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.919" offset="543660">I believe they were three or four or five prosecution witnesses who had already testified, the jury had been impaneled of course and the trial was on and he got up and made the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.891" offset="587546">The trial judge stopped the trial, asked him what his reasons were for changing lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.303" offset="621192">And he said in effect that he no longer trusted his lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.686" offset="634671">He vacillated somewhat about it, but the judge then took an adjournment and said in effect I'm going to look into this.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.908" offset="667585">There was a hearing in chambers outside of the presence of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.011" offset="692036">He was questioned again why he was discharging his lawyers and whether he really wanted another lawyer or just wanted to add a lawyer and he said he very vacillated around.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.397" offset="729548">Finally, the judge gave him 24 hours to see if he could find himself another lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.453" offset="757760">Meanwhile, the jury was coming in and going out but none of these proceedings were going on in front of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.234" offset="780852">They were just sitting in or standing around the courtroom waiting.</text>

            <text syncTime="232.043" offset="928078">One question of law is whether it has to do with a question involving present or rather insanity after a conviction, after a conviction and a sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="268.993" offset="1075931">Now, this is the question that was before this Court in the Phyle case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2400.721" offset="9602821">The psychiatrists visit them at least 20 days before execution, 60 days after they come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.216" offset="9632810">There's a continuum of movement of psychiatrists in and out of the row examining these men.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.094" offset="9664366">They make their reports in writing to the warden.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.001" offset="9675964">The warden has the report and goes and talk to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.695" offset="9702713">That's the California system in practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.850" offset="9715357">It was the British system.</text>

            <text syncTime="2434.013" offset="9736046">Now, why it should it be in the warden?</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.565" offset="9750256">Because the warden is the last man who sees this condemned prisoner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.446" offset="9773767">He walks down the aisle with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.541" offset="9786096">He is the man who must decide and the man who was on-the-spot that makes the decision to have judicial review or any kind of review with what we know what mental illnesses, the psychiatrists tell us, I'm fearful they may be right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.036" offset="9888078">I may be sane one day and insane another day.</text>

            <text syncTime="2484.229" offset="9936875">And -- and if the contention asked for is the proper contention, well then it means today's adjudication on review goes in the waste paper basket tomorrow as useless because I may lose my sanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.030" offset="10016078">Tomorrow or the next day in California, we have certain safeguards at execution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.622" offset="10042410">A new date of execution has to be set not less than 20, no more than 60 days from the day the judge sets the date which is that on.</text>

            <label>Mr. George T. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="2813.686" offset="11254700">I'd like to take just a few minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.676" offset="11262642">I -- I do enjoy and appreciate the -- Mr. Linn's sense of humor and especially on these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.846" offset="11295347">He is sometimes referred to at home as guest house clearance and I suppose that that's -- comports with his manner of handling this type of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.743" offset="11334949">Now Mr. Linn makes a very interesting plea here in which he tells you how psychiatrists act and how wardens act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.393" offset="11365564">I could make quite a contrary statement about the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.157" offset="11380611">I'm not going to impose upon your time to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.972" offset="11391791">I presume the Court is just as aware as I am that this rather coy and subtle and suave approach by Mr. Linn on the basis of things entirely outside of the record have really no bearing on this situation.</text>

            <label>Justice Hugo L. Black</label>
            <text syncTime="2862.620" offset="11450410">I'd rather note, Mr. Linn made a very fair presentation here.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="george_t_davis" startTime="2865.717" stopTime="3208.351">
            <label>Mr. George T. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="2865.717" offset="11462844">Well, I -- I feel that his statements on the subject of what prison psychiatrists do are at least subject to some contrary statement on my side.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.125" offset="11508402">Now, we have felt and I think you're going to find out when you hear the facts as distinguished from the law with reference to the next case that Mr. Linn's discussion about what happens isn't quite what happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.268" offset="11556989">Now, the fact to the matter as I see it is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.296" offset="11565140">It's not a question whether people have a right to do something if they want to do it and such as the warden's attitude or actions here, well whether it's a situation where he can examine if he wishes to, whether he can let you come in with a psychiatrist if he wishes to, the question is do we have a right to it or not?</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.152" offset="11644552">Does the law as it should be interpreted and should be applied does due process of law as it -- as we feel it should be interpreted and applied in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.933" offset="11687706">Does it put us in the position where we have rights rather than where we just rely on the good wishes, the goodwill or the whims or the caprice of the warden in a particular case at a particular time?</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.465" offset="11741832">He won't let Dr. Diamond in but if he feels like it he'll let someone else in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.046" offset="11760118">Now we take the position that we are entitled to an application and to an interpretation of the law that clarifies that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.859" offset="11799406">Either we have a right to go there and we have a right to have some kind of a hearing, and we have a right to do something other than secrecy and ex parte procedure or we don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.149" offset="11844545">Now, this endless argument about the endless petitions, it's been made many times that if you don't watch out you're going to find a petition here sort of as was set in the Nobles case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.525" offset="11898044">Petitions will continue to be made dependent upon the fecundity of the ideas of the -- of the prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.697" offset="11926779">Well, I think the answer is also contained in the Nobles case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.949" offset="11939736">After all, petitions for certiorari can be filed just about as fast as often as anybody can draw up a piece of paper and file them but they're not granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.059" offset="11976202">And the Courts have a right and there is a place and a way where these endless procedures can be prevented and can be stopped, and it is not a fair statement of this problem to say that because it is subject of possibility of abuse that abuse must necessarily follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.964" offset="12051853">I don't think that that will necessarily follow and I don't think that should be a prevailing matter before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.427" offset="12089678">I don't know why Mr. Linn went into this discussion about the last night of filing of the petition for mandamus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.109" offset="12116428">But as long as he tells you what everybody else has told him, I'd like to say to the Court that since he's raised that question, I didn't even want to file a petition for mandamus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.313" offset="12153208">I've been reluctant because I've been an unpaid pro-bono public counsel all through in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.140" offset="12176509">And finally on the last night, I called the Catholic prison chaplain who certainly has more contact with these people than the warden or anybody else and asked him if he thought this man was insane.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.112" offset="12224366">And he said he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.426" offset="12229695">And I couldn't do anything but file that petition after a statement like that even though it was an hour or two before the scheduled time of execution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.708" offset="12262818">Now my position before the Court is this, and may I say this to Your Honor, that I -- I want to make one explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.290" offset="12293120">I was looking at my petition and I must say that I have filed so many petitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.182" offset="12308689">I had just filed a petition in the United States District Court in which I raised both of these questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.970" offset="12339827">Then I filed this petition in this Court and I have reached the point where I was just about hopeless about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.056" offset="12364173">I did not put that question in the petition on file.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.720" offset="12378802">But when I suddenly found that certiorari had been granted, I went ahead and argued the point because I thought that perhaps the subject matter had some relevance even to the first point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.260" offset="12424986">And I -- I must admit -- and will say frankly to the Court -- that it was argued but it is not properly before the Court on the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.840" offset="12455288">The other point, however is and I certainly submit to Your Honors that the way that Mr. Linn has vacillated in a sense about what he thinks ought to be done in the previous history of this case or this type of case would seem to indicate that in order to set this subject at rest there ought to be a decision on the fundamental basic legal question involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.038" offset="12544104">Because I will concede and I don't want you, Mr. Justice Black to think that I meant anything offensive to Mr. Linn by my remark.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.680" offset="12574720">I want to concede along with him, that if this is not set at rest as a matter of law, a very strange and perhaps difficult situation may develop in California because if there are going to be statements made or if the Court is going to send it back again on the theory that if the warden wants to do what he can do then there will be petitions and matters before the warden and we can be practically assured that the net result will be that the cases will be back up here again in several years from now because obviously it is not the intention of the warden or any of the public authorities in California to grant any hearings or give anybody a hearing on these matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.911" offset="12751621">And they have pretty well made their position clear in the -- in the papers that are on file and certainly it ought to be clear in listening to Mr. Clarence Linn discuss the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.757" offset="12798955">Now, we feel that this is a matter of rights, not a matter of privilege or permission and we ask you to decide it on that basis.</text>
