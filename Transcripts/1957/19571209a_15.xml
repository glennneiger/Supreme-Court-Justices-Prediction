            <text syncTime="27.968" offset="111804">If the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.633" offset="118491">This is an appeal from a three-judge court in the District of Utah.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.037" offset="152137">The action was brought by the appellants here, the plaintiff below, for the purpose of setting aside an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission taking jurisdiction of and raising Utah intrastate railroad freight rates under the provisions of Section 13 (4) of the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.493" offset="249940">The decision below was a 2-to-1 decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.740" offset="262896">The majority report was concurred in by Circuit Judge Pickett and Judge Ritter and a minority opinion written by Judge Christensen.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.020" offset="308036">The opinions are -- appear in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.737" offset="330919">The manner in which this case arose is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.887" offset="347533">In 1951 or shortly before that date, the railroads, class one railroads of the United States made application to the Interstate Commerce Commission for an increase in substantially all interstate rail freight rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.031" offset="428095">The first hearing on this application which was given the Number Ex Parte 175, and by which I will refer to the proceedings hereafter, all railroads in the United States were granted permission to increase their freight rates by 2% with certain hold-down which are not material here.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.662" offset="518583">At a subsequent hearing, the eastern roads were permitted to take an additional 7% and the western and southern roads an additional 4%.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.926" offset="571664">And there's still a third here on hearing under Ex Parte 175.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.245" offset="588904">The eastern roads were permitted to take an additional 6% and the western and southern roads an additional 9% so that all told under Ex Parte 175, the interstate rate -- freight rates of all the railroads with, as I said, certain hold-downs which are not material here were increased by 15%.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.308" offset="685140">Shortly after the original application was made with the public or with the Interstate Commerce Commission, the class one railways which operated within and through the State of Utah, made application to the Public Service Commission of Utah for authority to increase their intrastate rates by the same percentages being sought in the Interstate Commerce Commission on interstate rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.491" offset="777927">The time of the first increase before the I.C.C., a hearing was held for the Utah Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.523" offset="814080">The conclusion of this hearing, the Utah Commission ruled, the railroads have not introduced evidence sufficient to authorize the increase of the intrastate rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.479" offset="857861">The time of the second order in the Ex Parte 175, a further petition was filed with the Utah Commission but no hearing was ever had on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.794" offset="891089">And then at the time of the final order, in Ex Parte 175 on the -- that had build up to 15%, a third petition was filed by the Utah Commission with this class one railways and a full hearing was held thereon and at the conclusion of the hearing, the Utah Commission ruled that the petitioning railroads have not introduced evidence sufficient to authorize the increase of the Utah intrastate rates and held that the application was denied subject to the right of the railroad to make a petition to reopen to introduce the additional evidence if they could do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.535" offset="1042077">The railroads did not make further application to the Utah Commission nor did they take any appeal in the Utah courts, rather they made application to the Interstate Commerce Commission under the provisions of Section 13 to have the Interstate Commerce Commission take jurisdiction of this Utah rates and raise them.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.857" offset="1131416">The Interstate Commerce Commission proceeded with a hearing of the Utah intrastate rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.082" offset="1156284">And at the conclusion of that hearing, issued the report and order which appears evidence in the court below in which they held that the requisite jurisdictional facts had been established to authorize the Interstate Commerce Commission to take jurisdiction of the Utah rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.741" offset="1234860">They did take jurisdiction of the Utah intrastate rail rates and ordered them increased by 15% with certain restricted hold-down which again are not material here.</text>

            <text syncTime="353.916" offset="1415628">No, it was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.806" offset="1435167">This action as I've stated then -- was then brought in the three-judge court to set aside this order.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.252" offset="1464947">A preliminary injunction was entered holding the rates out of effect while the matter was considered and this stayed in effect until a matter was decided on its merits and as I've stated by two to one decision, the action if the Interstate Commerce Commission was upheld by the Utah three-judge court.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.348" offset="1549375">Now, we are not here of course protesting the power of the Interstate Commerce Commission to take jurisdiction of intrastate rates in a proper case.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.565" offset="1594201">We recognized the necessity where interstate and intrastate service is rendered by a common economic unit that somebody must have overall control to determine that too much of the burden is not shifted one way or the other and even before the Section 13 was adopted, this Court have already decided that that power existed inherently in the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.039" offset="1696078">That was in the Houston case.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.702" offset="1706736">The interstate -- the Section 13 was merely a codification of the Houston case and it decided or it establishes that the Interstate Commerce Commission can take jurisdiction of purely intrastate rates only if one of two conditions exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.246" offset="1780924">The first condition is, if the intrastate rates are so low that they make a discrimination between persons shipping on -- in interstate commerce on the one hand and intrastate commerce on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.894" offset="1843513">Now, with regard to that first ground of jurisdiction, the Interstate Commerce Commission decided that the railroads did not establish that ground of jurisdiction in this case and so we need to concern ourselves no further here with the first ground of jurisdiction under the 13th Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.753" offset="1918955">The second ground of jurisdiction under which the railroad or the I.C.C.may take jurisdiction of intrastate rates is this, if the rates are so low that they cast a burden on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.371" offset="1977469">In other words, if the intrastate revenue -- net revenue that is the amount of railroads can keep after paying the expenses is so low that it does not pay the railroads return on that portion of the capital, devolves the intrastate commerce and therefore that an extra financial burden must be placed on interstate commerce then the Interstate Commerce Commission in that situation may take jurisdiction of intrastate rates and raise them.</text>

            <text syncTime="540.195" offset="2160744">That is the basis upon which the I.C.C.took jurisdiction in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="808.855" offset="3235318">The King case, as I read it, and also the Illinois Commerce case which it quotes, is merely a syllogistic reasoning, it says this in effect, “You're relieved to breaking down your revenues, your expenses and your investment between intrastate and interstate, if you can meet this test.</text>

            <text syncTime="836.807" offset="3347226">Your major premise is the railroads are in need of a general overall increase in their railroad rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.739" offset="3378887">Your minor premise is this, “All factors which affect the reasonableness of rates are identical or reasonably similar as to both intrastate and interstate commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="1110.059" offset="4440189">There was a -- there was evidence on both sides there and we're not asking this Court to weigh that evidence at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.968" offset="4475820">We feel that the evidence heavenly preponderates in favor of the -- of our position that the intrastate rates from Utah were already considerably higher for a comparable service without the 15% increase in the interstate rates or before they got.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.038" offset="4536111">But once again I say there was evidence on both sides of that and we're not here asking the Supreme Court to weigh the evidence that was before the Interstate Commerce Commission of the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.699" offset="4590759">But now, going to the other side of the picture, and you've got to go to both sides of the picture in determining the thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.905" offset="4615523">That is the question of cost in rendering the service because we're not worried of gross revenues here as Mr. Collins so well points out in his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.238" offset="4644885">What we're worrying about is how much the railroads have left over to spend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.089" offset="4660349">So you've got to go to the other side of the thing and look at the cost factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.745" offset="4686890">What do we have in the way of identity of factors that affect the cost of rendering railroad service intrastate and interstate?</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.390" offset="4729522">Now, the railroads introduced one bit of evidence on that point, a one bit of evidence only and if that evidence is sufficient, I suppose, I have no standing before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.450" offset="4773721">If it's not, I should prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.314" offset="4785215">The evidence that they introduced and they didn't have to introduce it at all because this Court has taken the judicial notice of it several times and so as the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.179" offset="4820637">The evidence they introduced is the identity of cost factors was the fact that intrastate and interstate shipments are commonly mingled on the same cars, handled over the same rails to the same station to the same billing crews and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.135" offset="4884480">Now, I -- it's our position that while that does establish that many of these factors are similar, it does ignore entirely the question of density of traffic which we feel that one of the major items which go to make up the revenue cost of rendering the service of the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.763" offset="4962952">And I think the reason that the density of traffic is a major factor affecting cost is quite obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.372" offset="5005479">You can break railroad cost or any transportation cost or I suppose the cost of doing business in any business down roughly into two categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.816" offset="5043200">That is your fixed cost and your variable cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.788" offset="5059082">Your fixed cost stays just about the same regardless of how much you produce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.960" offset="5083742">Your variable cost tends to vary almost exactly with your output.</text>

            <text syncTime="2730.871" offset="10923468">If the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.316" offset="10933185">As it has been said, this case grew out of the 15% increase in interstate rates, which the Interstate Commerce Commission authorized in its 175 proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.968" offset="10999850">And this was the fourth general increase, rate increase given by the Commission since World War IV.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.496" offset="11037884">This rate increases have not been granted previously, they have been granted because of the constantly or gradually at least, rising price cost of operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.220" offset="11104862">As operating cost go up, revenue has to also otherwise that the weak roads will suffer deficits and they go into receivership.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.125" offset="11156480">And the stronger roads will have difficulty in financing, capital improvements, purchase of new equipment which is necessary or desirable to increase efficiency and improve service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.953" offset="11219801">Now, this clear statutory authority for the Commission's action in granting this across the board rate increases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.666" offset="11250625">Section 15 (a), which was written into to the Act in 1920, they did the duty of the Commission in determining or prescribing just and reasonable rate to give consideration to the need of the carriers for revenues sufficient to enable them to provide adequate and efficient transportation service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.981" offset="11351876">In effect, Congress recognized that it's in the public interest to preserve the economic health of the railroad industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.449" offset="11393776">This new statutory provision was prompted by the par less condition, credit and income conditions of the railroads, following termination of war time federal control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.078" offset="11452291">Now, the results of the railroad operation or both -- those of its intrastate and its interstate operations, it was therefore appropriate for Congress when it --</text>

            <text syncTime="2877.354" offset="11509342">I say it's -- well if the revenue needs or determined by its entire operations which are naturally both intrastate and interstate and when Congress gave the condition prior to adjust interstate rates in relation to revenue requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.582" offset="11594292">It was appropriate to give it some control over interstate rates so that the additional revenue derived from higher rates would not come exclusively from interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.883" offset="11647478">And Congress, when it enacted 15 (a) also enacted subsection (4) of Section 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.835" offset="11679242">And that Section directs the Commission if it finds that existing intrastate rates aren't justly discriminate against interstate commerce to order those rates to remove the discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.835" offset="11739324">But with constant Railroad Commission case in 257 U.S., this was the first case under this Section to come before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.341" offset="11781329">The Court said that there was dovetail relation between 13 (4) and the present 13 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.627" offset="11818423">And that there must be equality between the intrastate rate level and the interstate rate level if interstate commerce was to bear its fair proportionate share of the carriers total revenue affirmance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.130" offset="11896477">There has been no departure from the meaning that was given by the Court in that first decision, to Section 13 (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.201" offset="11936705">Now, I also going to point out that the Court has consistently refused to construe either 13 (4) or 15 (a) as imposing requirements which would defeat the statutory purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.331" offset="12005251">When revenue and expense were out of balance, a long lay in correcting the imbalance is certainly tends to defeat the statutory purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.310" offset="12061153">And this Court has held that when the Commission is acting under these Sections, it is not to be held to requirements of proof that are so exacting, that they would make the administrative test practically impossible and would paralyze the administrative order of the Commission and thereby prevent the prompt administrative action which these Sections contemplate.</text>

            <text syncTime="5447.293" offset="21789153">The first case decided after the Interstate Commerce Commission or rather after it declared the 13th Section powers and exercise them in that case.</text>

            <text syncTime="5468.242" offset="21872953">This Court in that case sustained the constitutionality of the grant of power and rejected the contention that the federal government was encroaching upon the States and laid down the law to be that whatever encroachment there might be, I mean it was not an unconstitutional encroachment and that whatever encroachment there were was in -- was essential to the maintenance of an adequate national railroad system.</text>
            <text syncTime="5501.477" offset="22005864">Now, from that day until this, this Court has upheld and ordered the Interstate Commerce Commission which followed that pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="5513.224" offset="22052885">I'm constrained to suggest these things to you because the State of Utah, in an effort to try to frustrate the Commission's powers under Section 13 of the Act is resorted to all sorts of free arguments like this density of traffic thing and we -- they're much pleased with themselves to try to break up the pattern that this Court has followed for 35 years within -- within the last few months or certainly since your decision in the King case, the Florida case.</text>

            <text syncTime="5573.638" offset="22294465">Now all those three had been affirmed by this Court without listening to argument, without taking them for argument, without citing a single decision as the Court in way back when I was young did cite some decisions in a per curiam affirmance.</text>

            <text syncTime="5677.470" offset="22709812">The thing we are prone to call discrimination against interstate commerce in these cases under Section 13 of the Interstate Commerce Act is not just that alone, it's a -- it is a matter of providing revenues sufficient to enable the railroads to maintain an adequate national railroad transportation system which was a matter of such concern to Congress that they decided that they put a stop to the state commissions from forcing undue preference of its state traffic and that's the history of the 1920 Transportation Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="5796.338" offset="23185345">You'll see that the Commission there dealt with some 20 commodities in detail as to volume and revenues and all of that sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5807.230" offset="23228918">Now, the needs of the revenues were going into the fact that we derive from intrastate traffic in Utah, a lower ton mile reward or earning from hauling the traffic of that State then we do for holding traffic in the western district generally, the interstate traffic I mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="5833.074" offset="23332258">The shipper of interstate traffic pays more to get this traffic across the State of Utah mile from mile in all but a few isolated distances then the intrastate shipper pays for a holding having his traffic hold from inside the eastern border to just inside the western border of the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="5874.684" offset="23498710">They said that this Section 13 was intended to make states traffic pay for states work by railroads in hauling that traffic.</text>

            <text syncTime="6140.006" offset="24560013">You can't -- I don't see how it could be hoped that this Court could sustain a doctrine to the effect that the Utah intrastate shipper is entitled to have lower rates just because we have a lot of (Inaudible) little traffic moving at higher interstate rates across that State of Utah.</text>

            <text syncTime="6261.604" offset="25046413">It's in some place in the railroads brief where they -- I quote from a Commission report as far back as 1935 in which they said prior to that date, the rail -- the intrastate rates in Utah and the interstate rates in traffic to through and from the state and in adjoining areas was generally on -- on approximately equal level.</text>

            <label>Mr. Keith Sohm</label>
            <text syncTime="6393.521" offset="25573982">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="6394.829" offset="25579311">The -- Mr. Weston I think mentioned in great detail and the first part of this testimony, I mean the argument of Mr. Calvin, excuse me, mentioned in great detail on the fist part of his argument and it seemed to infer all of it that the only thing they think is necessary is to show that there is substantial conditions that are the same in interstate and intrastate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="6424.907" offset="25699579">We submit that they did not so do and came far from it is a matter of fact because much of the Utah evidence introduced shows that the rates, in a lot of instances in intrastate commerce was higher than rates on in -- interstate commerce in similar conditions and similar situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="6444.551" offset="25778155">This was observed by the Honorable Judge Christensen in the Circuit Court of Appeal when he dissented from the majority decision -- Circuit Court and District Court excuse me, when he stated this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6461.498" offset="25845969">Other evidential matters mentioned in the prevailing opinion as a foundation for the Commission's conclusion are belief insufficient to permit possible inferences to that effect in view of the record as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="6476.824" offset="25907200">Such disparity of rates as were shown are in both directions and it is well established that a mere disparity of rates establishes no sufficient basis for such an order.</text>
            <text syncTime="6489.067" offset="25956206">We recognize the fact that there may have been a disparity rates but the disparity was of course in both directions, some of them in favor of the Interstate Commerce Commission and some otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="6500.820" offset="26003226">Now, an argument, Mr. Collins mentioned that there was a saving clause which was suppose to protect the State Commission in case any rates where slightly higher in intrastate commerce than in interstate commerce and we submit that that saving clause has no effect and gives us no advantage because the principal number of rates and the principal structure of rates within the State of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="6529.539" offset="26118060">It is impossible to identify similar circumstances and similar instances under which we can take advantage of that saving clause so that with the exception of very few instances that saving clause has no effect or no advantage to the Public Service Commission of Utah and the rates within the State of Utah.</text>
            <text syncTime="6550.234" offset="26200921">Now, we have no argument with the railroads and we're not attempting to frustrate the Court nor the Interstate Commerce Commission though I may admit we probably frustrated the railroads to a short degree because we haven't fallen in line with all of the States that have been asking for increases, all of the States that have denied or granted these increases for instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="6575.539" offset="26302067">On November or October the 10th, 1957, the -- Alabama Commission granted an increase in rates that was petitioned before them by the railroads and this is the -- in granting it, they state this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6590.833" offset="26363298">“It is with reluctance and a definite misgiving that we authorize the sought increase.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6596.880" offset="26387435">Nevertheless, we cannot ignore the strong compelling consideration of the ever threatening mess to our power in jurisdiction and existence of the federal statute books of the 13th Section of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6609.627" offset="26438426">The rights of the State of Alabama as well as other individual states to regulate the intrastate general rate level according to its best judgment has been all but negated by federal encroachment under the strained and continue -- continually broadening construction of the provision of federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="6630.069" offset="26520242">We just haven't been quite as remiss in allowing railroads to take over our rates had the Interstate Commerce Commission as the Alabama and other Commission's have.</text>
            <text syncTime="6641.705" offset="26566740">Now, we haven't then unfair with the railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="6647.163" offset="26588578">In this last case in which they're appealing from now, we held a hearing, asked them for evidence to prove that they needed this increase and they failed to produce it so we left the record open.</text>
            <text syncTime="6659.863" offset="26639360">They left the record open as they stated for 60 days but instead ended up by living record open for three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="6666.870" offset="26667468">They're asking the railroads to comeback and give us some evidence and show us where you need these rates in the State of Utah and they did not so do.</text>
            <text syncTime="6678.920" offset="26715638">There's lots of -- lots of problems suggested that are complicated and involved by the arguments and the briefs on both sides in this case but it's fundamental.</text>
            <text syncTime="6691.023" offset="26764016">And I think Your Honors can appreciate that, that this railroad whether it's in an Interstate Commerce Commission proceeding where the Interstate Commerce Commission initiates the proceeding upon petition by the railroads or whether it's a railroad case before the State Commission that they've got to make a case and they've got to carry the burden of proof to show that they need these rates in the State of Utah and that the State of Utah is not bearing its fair share of the interstate and the overall revenues of the railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="6724.796" offset="26899122">They did not so make a prima facie case and carry that burden of proof and as counsel for the appellants have argued the first instance, stated, the Utah Commission, when he state further -- step further and did introduced evidence to show that in many instances the rates in the State of Utah are already higher that the -- the density was higher and therefore of a greater benefit to the railroads that the -- and I refer to the brief of counsel in this matter that the ton mile figures as a matter of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="6770.785" offset="27083128">In the record, page 116, an analysis of the revenue for ton mile produced by the Utah Commission statistical expert show -- break -- brought down the products into manufactured and miscellaneous agriculture, animals, and mines.</text>
            <text syncTime="6793.174" offset="27172676">And showed that the total of these products in intrastate was produced a revenue for ton mile of $1.21.</text>
            <text syncTime="6805.199" offset="27220741">In interstate it produced a revenue of $1.06.</text>
            <text syncTime="6811.734" offset="27246864">The railroads have produced a ton mile study of their own and introduced it in the record in page 99.</text>
            <text syncTime="6820.693" offset="27282704">And that they have taken the overall of the whole United States to show what the revenue for ton mile was.</text>
            <text syncTime="6829.300" offset="27317185">They have taken the Western District and they have taken the figure in connection with Utah to show what the ton mile figures are.</text>
            <text syncTime="6836.955" offset="27347801">We submit that the -- that the railroads not only have failed to carry their burden of proof but they have -- but we have already actually taken the burden and shown that they should not have the increases within the State of Utah and that if they did so have them, they would be discriminating against the intrastate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="6860.014" offset="27439961">In the railroads position that they should have automatically an increase the same as and identical to that increase granted on Interstate Commerce Commission is an absurdity to presume that the conditions within the State of Utah are identical to the conditions in Alabama for instance or the conditions in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="6886.732" offset="27546854">And that they -- the exact amount of increase should be imposed upon Utah as in those areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="6894.512" offset="27577992">For instance in the original case of the Interstate Commerce Commission's investigation in which time they actually imposed this 15% increase, their order called Ex Parte 175.</text>
            <text syncTime="6908.860" offset="27635357">Three of the Interstate Commerce Commission commissioners joined in a dissent and they stated this, it was written by Atchison.</text>
            <text syncTime="6918.730" offset="27674854">“I cannot agree that the revenue needs of the petitioning railroads and all three great territories are so equal as to warrant a uniform nationwide increase in rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="6930.064" offset="27720202">And that same Commissioner, I'm sure would look at this thing and say, “No.</text>
            <text syncTime="6933.554" offset="27734204">I can't understand and I can't agree that the needs of all of the railroads throughout the United States is equal and exact than all of the States of the union that Utah has to be exactly the same as these others that the uniform rate increase on other states is not necessarily the particular rate increase that should be imposed upon the State of Utah.</text>
            <text syncTime="6959.579" offset="27838276">It's time to say that our little Tulare Valley Railroad in Salt Lake, in Utah or the Bamberger Railroad in Utah has to have and has the exact revenue needs that New York Central has that that obviously is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="6974.359" offset="27897417">The railroads gave us no evidence upon which we could really determine what the revenue needs were of the railroads in Utah as distinguished from the railroads that are out of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="6987.742" offset="27950916">The railroads gave no evidence of their cost of operation in Utah as compared to the revenues in Utah.</text>
            <text syncTime="6995.386" offset="27981531">They did state that we need $1,860,000 in order to -- to make the operations in Utah and bring us a fair return but that's like an employees saying to his employer that last year if you had given me 15% increase, I will donate 1000 more dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="7021.277" offset="28085081">And therefore I'm losing $1000.</text>
            <text syncTime="7023.563" offset="28094171">Therefore this year given 15% increase in my wages so that I won't lose $1000 this year.</text>
            <text syncTime="7030.988" offset="28123951">It's not evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="7032.014" offset="28128026">It's a conclusion and a finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="7035.196" offset="28140774">The carriers in the west by evidence is shown in the exhibits are in a more favorable position than the carriers in the east.</text>
            <text syncTime="7045.095" offset="28180376">The illustration given by the counsel in the first argument, Mr. Rampton showed that the D &amp; R.G.had a 6.06 rate of return, whose operations are 50% within the State of Utah.</text>
            <text syncTime="7062.248" offset="28248921">The Bamberger Railroad which is all commodity railroad operating with its line solely within the State of Utah has a very high rate of return 15.98%.</text>
            <text syncTime="7077.455" offset="28309734">It has never been adequately explained by the railroads nor the Interstate Commerce Commission why that high rate of return exists within the State of Utah on an all commodity road.</text>
