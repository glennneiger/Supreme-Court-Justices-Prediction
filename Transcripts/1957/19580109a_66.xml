            <text syncTime="730.852" offset="2923311">Also, that proportional representation as such is -- is not required by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.406" offset="2945567">This Court simply requires that your juries, the names in the jury box be selected without discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.320" offset="2985273">Now, the cases as I understand them also hold that findings of fact by a state court will have great weight with this Court, but of course I'm not binding on it and that this Court will look at the facts to determine whether the state court found them correctly and applied them correctly.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.397" offset="3073567">The evidence on proportional -- I mean, on discrimination was set out at length in the opinion of the Alabama Supreme Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3404.826" offset="13619304">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.636" offset="13634456">The case of Jeremiah Reeves versus State of Alabama as reported at 340 U.S. 891, 75 Supreme Court 214 cites two cases in the season of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.061" offset="13724212">There was no direction given by this Court and the case was not remanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.738" offset="13758903">As a matter of fact, it's just a reversal and however we take the position that this reversal, unqualified reversal amounted to a plea of not guilty so far as defendant is -- was concerned and that the defendant should have been discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.278" offset="13849078">We -- this case was decided upon by this Court in December 1954 and the defendant was held in jail until May of 1955 at which time he was again found guilty and sentenced to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.766" offset="13946984">We feel that any discussion of our motions relative to the indictment in the grand jury should have been considered by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.586" offset="14010305">On November the 14th as we've already said, the defendant was indicted and he was arraigned on November 15th which I'm sure was less than the indictment -- the arraignment followed the indictment less than 24 hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.631" offset="14094524">The -- the juries of the honorable court of Montgomery has this -- has this discretion to allow the defendant in such cases to withdraw his plea of not guilty and in this case, a plea of not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.785" offset="14183131">And it seems to me that where a man is being tried before a court and his life is in jeopardy that it would not have been any trap at all for the Court to allow counsel for the defendant or petitioner to go into the indictment in the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.711" offset="14278844">An interesting thing about the jury commission of Montgomery County is that it is composed of the two Circuit Judges, the sheriff of the County, the judge of the probate court and the clerk of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.972" offset="14359824">The record will show that the Honorable Judge Carter has been a judge of Montgomery County for 21 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.799" offset="14411128">The record will show that the Honorable Judge Walter B. Jones has been a judge of Montgomery County for 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.182" offset="14452715">The record will show that Mr. John R. Mathews who is clerk of the court had been clerk for 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.732" offset="14498900">And all during that time, these men have served as jury commissioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.495" offset="14533904">Mr. John R. Mathews is also the Clerk of the jury commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.772" offset="14563056">Montgomery is somewhat different from most of the counties in Alabama and that any qualified citizen might be appointed as a member of the jury commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.211" offset="14612793">But in Montgomery, under the local law, they have to be either judge, sheriff, probate judge, or clerk of the court to be a member of the jury commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.000" offset="14663993">Now, concerning the fact that these three men mentioned have been commissioners or jury supervisors, whatever you call, for 20 years in a county where the population is 60% white, 40% colored, that they could held during that time very easily to familiarize themselves of the people of that county.</text>
            <text syncTime="3696.217" offset="14784784">It's different from other counties and that the commissioners might serve a year or two years or whatnot and then they have to come in and adjust themselves to the situation, but we find that even the Honorable Jurist Eugene Carter being asked about the grand juries in Montgomery County.</text>
            <text syncTime="3726.894" offset="14907559">This question is put to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3730.041" offset="14920098">“Do you know of any occasions when two or more Negroes sit on a grand jury?"</text>
            <text syncTime="3735.826" offset="14943295">He answers.</text>

            <text syncTime="3752.771" offset="15011004">Now, the question, “Do you recall the largest number of Negroes you saw serving on a jury at one time?"</text>
            <text syncTime="3761.002" offset="15043918">Answer: "No, I wouldn't know."</text>
            <text syncTime="3762.951" offset="15051755">Question: "Have you ever seen as many as four?"</text>
            <text syncTime="3766.374" offset="15065443">Answer: "It is impossible for me to tell you as many as four or how many.</text>
            <text syncTime="3772.340" offset="15089267">I don't know; "We hardly pick a jury now without -- now, listen to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3778.285" offset="15113091">"We would hardly pick a jury now about having over four."</text>
            <text syncTime="3785.528" offset="15142034">Question:"Four Negro jurors?"</text>
            <text syncTime="3787.665" offset="15150602">Answer: "I remember at one time there were very few.</text>
            <text syncTime="3794.448" offset="15177770">In fact, we were not able to get them until the last year or two."</text>
            <text syncTime="3800.883" offset="15203474">Now, this is in 1955 of making.</text>
            <text syncTime="3804.749" offset="15218939">Jeremiah Reeves was indicted on November 14, 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="3813.852" offset="15255406">That is the mission on the part of the witness here that during that time, they had very few Negroes on the jury list.</text>
            <text syncTime="3828.706" offset="15314756">Now, in 1955, when he's being tried and we asked the Court to let us withdraw the pleas of the defendant and file our motion to quash the indictment, the Court refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="3850.007" offset="15400020">And certainly, it seems that the type of testimony which we have in the case of this kind that there is discrimination or there was in 1952, discrimination in Montgomery County, Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="3873.251" offset="15492911">Now, we are not alleging before this Court the proposition as put to you in the respondent's brief on proportional representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3887.233" offset="15548918">We are not arguing that, but we are saying as your decision -- decisions hold that the selection of jurors should be done according to the Court of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="3905.057" offset="15620180">That is considering all the qualifications out there that they will include men, just men between the ages of 21 and 65.</text>
            <text syncTime="3922.137" offset="15688516">That's all we asked, but the testimony will show that the witnesses in their anxiety to be fair to testify that they deliberately went out and got Negroes and put them on the list.</text>
            <text syncTime="3943.393" offset="15773571">Well, I don't think that is the law either.</text>
            <text syncTime="3946.862" offset="15787363">I don't think it should be a matter of inclusion or exclusion, just a fair system of operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3956.846" offset="15827383">That's all we asked and in order to try this defendant before their Court.</text>
