            <text syncTime="9.819" offset="39184">I'd like to say that our position is that there was no real significant change in the responsibilities before or of after 322.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.805" offset="79203">But that I mean this, it is true that before 322 the Government could take its good time about determining whether it owed the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.830" offset="139285">But my point and our point here is that that was not a final determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.732" offset="162900">If the carrier did not like that, the carrier could go into Court and some judicial tribunal will determine whether or not that was a proper payment by the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="54.919" offset="219638">In that case, Your Honor, the burden of proof would be on the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.019" offset="236042">And after 322, the railroads could go in and sue on the amount deducted that is, they could've gone in and sued on this $1025.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.752" offset="286929">And if they have then it would have been up to the railroads to prove their case.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.037" offset="312111">We are not saying in any way that the railroad should be relieved from the burden of proving their case.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.530" offset="350041">We are simply saying that when the railroad sues for one bill and the Government convened by way of affirmative defense at its set off.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.138" offset="404480">We are saying that the railroad does not have the burden of disproving the Government's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.611" offset="434364">And conversely, the Government does have the real burden of proving that its counterclaim in set off is valid.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edmund M. Sweeney</label>
            <text syncTime="128.208" offset="512731">Yes, we would and we would do that just as a matter of -- of practical mechanics of a -- of a suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.926" offset="555677">First of all Mr. Justice, may I explain that -- I don't know how to explain it because I know, you know more about than I do, but there's nothing mystical about a 322 transaction between the Government and the railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.854" offset="623386">They do not at all act at arm's length.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.567" offset="634253">First of all, the railroad and the Government both employed very experienced, highly trained personnel in rates and divisions classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.141" offset="684513">And when the Government says that they have overpaid the railroad, the railroad looked it over and there is a -- an amicable interchange of their opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.798" offset="731115">And I would say that possibly at least 95% of the cases where there is a deduction under 322, there is an amicable adjustment.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.321" offset="777195">Now, actually in the case here before us today, that -- that very so -- same thing happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.565" offset="798198">They deducted $1025.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.695" offset="814707">After looking the thing over, the railroad agreed that all but $402, it was a proper deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.339" offset="849293">Likewise, the Government agreed, too, that in part of it that Service Order 68 did not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.031" offset="880118">So you see, it's one of those things where they -- it's a workable rule and they tried to work out the best they can.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.718" offset="906867">However, we say that it is not fair or just unreasonable to impute to Section 322 the right in the Government when they have come to a stalemate with the railroad, the right in the Government to say, “Well, I listened to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.435" offset="985652">You're a nice fellow, but this is it.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.028" offset="1000072">We're going to make the determination and we say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.295" offset="1013133">You either pay us back or else."</text>
            <text syncTime="255.561" offset="1022224">And the “or else” is the deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.134" offset="1032464">We say that in lieu of some -- there is no means of -- for arbitrating these stalemates.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.847" offset="1063288">And we say that the only proper tribunal is the one that's left which is the judicial tribunal.</text>

            <text syncTime="317.514" offset="1269969">The -- the burden could shift if it could be shown that there were facts which were peculiarly within the knowledge of the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.237" offset="1300898">Now, actually as -- well, as the case finally developed for the Government now, they are saying that they did, that they did present a prima facie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.169" offset="1352620">And they are saying that once they simply alleged that the size of the car or that was available that that is sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.657" offset="1394625">And then the burden of going forward shifted to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.587" offset="1410299">Now, I say this, if they had put in one scintilla of evidence in this case that there were cars of the size available, this -- or the cars of the size ordered available then at least that would have been some indication that they were prepared to assume the burden of proving that counterclaim and it would have been up to the Court to determine within whose province lay the peculiarity of these facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.012" offset="1532029">Now, in meeting the Government's argument in the railroad's brief, we have pointed out actually and as a matter of fact that in this case, I do not think that the Government could successfully allege that the facts were peculiarly within the knowledge of the railroad, because first of all, the Government who ought to found the relief was very unhappy with the Service Order 68, so unhappy that shortly after it was inaugurated by the ICC, they petitioned to have it waived insofar it applied running Government shipments.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.210" offset="1688764">And in that particular petition which by the way it's set out as Exhibit A in the railroad's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.457" offset="1721783">In that petition the War Department went to great lengths to show what they were doing to see to it that all facets of the transportation facilities were being used.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.779" offset="1767027">And they pointed out that they had made spot inspections and they have this and they have that.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.366" offset="1789388">It's quite amply, I submit, setting forth that the Government knew just as much about or whether we had cars available or not, but to get back Your Honor's question, if that had -- if it is true that had the case progressed to the point where the Government was assuming its burden of proof, they might well have come a place in the case where the burden of going forward might have shifted.</text>

            <text syncTime="505.983" offset="2023863">It is true that it was summary judgment, but it was summary judgment filed by the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.691" offset="2046746">The -- the motion filed by the Government was a motion I didn't quite understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.645" offset="2074540">It was a motion which said, “We seek judgment for the Government because the plaintiff,” being the railroad, “Has not alleged facts which entitled it to relief.”</text>
            <text syncTime="532.011" offset="2128039">Now, the District Court denied that motion and at the same time the railroad had filed a motion for summary judgment claiming that there was no general issue of facts outstanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.928" offset="2183628">And since we do not believe that the facts of -- whether we knew or they knew more about the availability of the cars, that wasn't alleged to the facts so the Court naturally assume that -- I mean, they decided on the facts that there was no fact outstanding.</text>

            <text syncTime="596.536" offset="2386129">My recollection of the record, of the file in the case is that the Government sent out what they call a Form 103 and that form says on it or contains on it the -- the new computation procedure according to the determination of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.882" offset="2467527">And I think it simply said that Service Order 68 did not apply, something to that effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="880.733" offset="3522873">How could the Government be expected to know and to prove that your railroad didn't have cars on that particular day of the particular size that were called for, for the lower tariff?</text>

          <turn speaker="edmund_m_sweeney" startTime="899.260" stopTime="1139.522">
            <label>Mr. Edmund M. Sweeney</label>
            <text syncTime="899.260" offset="3596957">Because, Your Honor, the -- the transportation during the war as you know was conducted by the transportation corps and they had a man assigned to each area and those were the persons who ordered the cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.953" offset="3651709">Now, at any time -- at any time that the -- first of all, these cars were not loaded by the railroad, they were given over to a Government train.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.260" offset="3701029">They have a depot of some sort where they were being loaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.212" offset="3716807">Now, at any time that the cars came in there, they did not necessarily come in, in the one, two, three order that they were ordered on the bill of lading, say of yesterday, because that would have been almost impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.170" offset="3772604">So, if they ordered 10 cars, the 10 cars were shifted over to them as they came in and the Government had its own selection of the number of cars that come in to its own depot as to which one they'd use first or which one they'd use second.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.922" offset="3827670">Now, if at anytime the safety army for example, if the army had received the cars in response to its orders, which cars were not in the size ordered, they could have refused to accept those cars and made the railroad determine whether or not they had them.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.126" offset="3920457">We -- I -- I think it is only reasonable to keep in mind in this context that the furnishing of Government or cars to the Government during the war was a tremendous problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.649" offset="3970508">And thus, it was one of those things where I think everybody just did the best they could to get along the best they could and it was only some six years afterwards, the two examiners in the GAO Office determined that we didn't have these cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.754" offset="4050965">As I read the Rule 34, now Rule 34 is in the -- it's ordered in classification number 14 and that is the one that has the rule in it that says that if the Government is unable to furnish a car of the size ordered, then it must charge only -- that it must charge with the size of the car furnished if the goods which are to be transported will not fit on the size of the car ordered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.960" offset="4195788">Now, that was a good rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.575" offset="4202266">Now, Service Order 68 which is the basis of this case waived that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.922" offset="4223687">And the result of Service Order 68 was this, that if the Government was unable -- if the railroad is unable to furnish the Government with a car of the size ordered then irrespective of whether or not the goods to be shipped could be shipped on that size or could not be shipped on that size the Government still paid for the size of the car furnished.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.224" offset="4316891">And I think it's real to point out here that this was not a rule put in by the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.220" offset="4340820">This is a rule put in by the ICC.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.650" offset="4350537">And in the petition by the Secretary of War to have this Service Order 68 defended as to the Government which is appendix A in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.229" offset="4392856">It is -- it is pointed out there that this was not to -- this is not something which the railroad had done and that it was something that the ICC had put in and that it was necessary even though the Government would suffer some additional payments for the larger size ordered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.225" offset="4492852">We think that it's -- I -- I sincerely think that it was just as easy for all the -- and under those circumstances, just as easy for the Government to prove the availability of the car -- size of the car or the size ordered as it was for the railroad.</text>

            <text syncTime="1611.874" offset="6447438">The 1950 Bill never could have been an issue because Congress in setting up the statutory scheme said that you will deduct from amounts found to be due to carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.547" offset="6478158">So, when Mr. Sweeney suggest that the railroad is willing to assume its burden, he is saying that the railroad is willing to assume its burden of proving the correctness of a bill which he already knows the Government has not and will not challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.480" offset="6529881">And that actual -- in actuality, we think this has to be governed by the statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.839" offset="6547331">Now, the private shipper interestingly enough, he can't make these deductions from subsequent bills.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.130" offset="6572513">He's in the position where he has to bring the affirmative proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.184" offset="6584633">That Congress could have done that with the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.048" offset="6592157">Congress could have said, “You were paid properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.184" offset="6600725">And if subsequently you think you've been overcharged, you can bring a suit and recover just the way a private shipper has.”</text>
