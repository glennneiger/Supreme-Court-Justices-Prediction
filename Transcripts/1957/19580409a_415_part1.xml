            <text syncTime="21.845" offset="87353">This case involves the question of whether the special machinery provided by Congress in Section 5 of the Interstate Commerce Act to encourage consolidations of carriers can be used for the slit up of a single carrier's operations into separate corporations for the purpose of escaping the regulatory policies applied by the State Utility Commission to the essentially intrastate operations involved in the split-up.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.686" offset="210651">It also raises the issue of whether it was an abuse of discretion to deny leave to amend the complaint to challenge the public interest findings of the Interstate Commerce Commission where the original complaint raised only the question of the applicability of the statute and the amendment was offered contemporaneously with the submission of cross-motions for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.037" offset="324127">The issue as to the applicability of Section 5 is of particular significance because of the interplay of federal state relationships in the regulation of local transportation services.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.240" offset="388911">The case is here on appeal from a judgment of a three-judge District Court affirming the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.387" offset="429453">That order, which was rendered in 1955, granted an application by Pacific Greyhound Lines and its newly created subsidiary, Golden Gate Transit Lines, to transfer Greyhound's local San Francisco Bay area operations to the new subsidiary, Golden Gate.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.002" offset="515971">The Interstate Commerce Commission held that Section 5 applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.287" offset="533107">This section provides that the transactions for the consolidation or merger or unification of carrier operations, either by acquisition of property or by arrangements for common control, must be first approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.585" offset="610325">And when so approved may be consummated without regard to the antitrust laws and without the approval of any other federal agency or of any state agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.963" offset="663824">If Section 5 does not apply to this transaction, then the Interstate Commerce Commission's authority is limited, under Section 212 (b), to a transfer of the interstate operating rights only and the State Commission would have jurisdiction over the proposed transfer of the intrastate service.</text>

            <text syncTime="561.230" offset="2244859">We made the point because this agreement as we saw this contrary to the finding of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.183" offset="2276728">The background of this case, if I may state it very briefly and the background is important because the -- a report of the Interstate Commerce Commission specifically recites that Greyhound's purpose in the slit-up is to escape the rate regulation policies of the California Public Utilities Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.248" offset="2368888">The background is essentially this.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.922" offset="2375680">I've already stated the area covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.099" offset="2384353">The population in that area is approximately 400,000 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.236" offset="2404937">The revenue from this service which is proposed to be split off is approximately $3,700,000 a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.101" offset="2440359">And of this revenue, 5.7% represents Interstate Commerce and 94.3% represents intrastate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.166" offset="2492604">Greyhound's dissatisfaction with the State Public Utilities Commission is based on several factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.585" offset="2526250">One is that in establishing rates for this local service, the State Public Utilities Commission has consistently held that Greyhound's revenue needs for this service should be determined in the light of its total intrastate revenues and that as long as Greyhound receives an adequate return in its total intrastate service, it is not entitled to an increase in rates in this particular segment.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.101" offset="2652369">And I might say that in its rate decisions, the State Commission has allowed Greyhound a fair rate of return on its intrastate operations in the most recent decision in 1957, a 7.1% rate of return was allowed on the total intrastate service.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.311" offset="2733244">In a decision in 1951, dealing with the statewide rates, a 6.4% rate of return was allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.287" offset="2769084">In applying this policy, the State Commission takes into consideration the fact that because of the necessity to preserve competition between Greyhound and others in other areas of the State, it is forced to establish rates in the other areas which give Greyhound more than a fair rate of return.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.206" offset="2864797">And that windfall is offset in the State Commission's minds by the rates that it establishes in this local service.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.131" offset="2900428">And the State Commission also states that it considers the law of diminishing returns with respect to increases in commuter rates and where it has given increases in this particular segment.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.269" offset="2949016">It has felt that there was a limiting factor as to the amount of revenue which effectively could be obtained by an increase by reason of the diversion of traffic to carpools and other means of transportation that would result if the increases were too high.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.645" offset="3022576">And finally, the carrier here, Greyhound, previously tried to get permission from the State Commission to transfer a portion of this service, the Marin Country portion, to another operator.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.762" offset="3082971">And after a lengthy hearing, the State Commission held that the proposed financing of that transfer of a limited segment of this operation was insufficient, even though the transferee was proposing to invest $200,000 working capital in the operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.386" offset="3165518">In this case, which involve not only Marin but Contra Costa and the Peninsula operation, Greyhound proposed to put into Golden Gate only $150,000 in working capital and the Interstate Commerce Commission conditioned its approval on the sum of only $250,000 as a working capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.790" offset="3271158">After the Interstate Commerce Commission had rendered its decision in which it rejected the protest made by the labor unions and by the present appellants as to the applicability of Section 5 and as to the public interest, both groups, both the unions and the present appellants filed a petition for rehearing before the Commission in which they again challenged the applicability of Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.129" offset="3380454">They challenged the public interest findings of the Commission and furthermore, they ask for further hearing because of some additional testimony which had been given after the Interstate Commerce Commission's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.394" offset="3437505">And I mention this because in the proposed amendment, we seek to charge abuse of discretion on the part of the Interstate Commerce Commission in denying this petition for further hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="918.686" offset="3674697">This was in the phase of the own showing of the carriers, that the one year's operation would produce a loss of $230,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.407" offset="3729554">Two weeks after the Interstate Commerce Commission order had been handed down, this same witness, testifying before the State Utilities Commission in a proceeding seeking an increase in rates for the -- for the Marin and Peninsula services, testified that there should be included in the rate base or rate-making purposes, the item of cash working capital in an amount equal to one-twelfth of the annual cash expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.586" offset="3870302">And in the examination in that case, he said most emphatically that this was a necessary working capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.036" offset="3900082">He even said that a new company would have to provide that much capital.</text>

            <text syncTime="1539.105" offset="6156330">Now, I feel -- if the Court please, that this question of whether we should have been permitted to make this amendment in the lower court is effectively controlled by what this Court did just a month ago in Spevack versus Strauss, 355 U.S.601, where in granting certiorari, it directed that the matter be remanded to the Court of Appeals with directions to allow an amendment to the complaint which had been presented there for the first time in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.456" offset="6321737">This reflects the liberal rules of pleading set forth in 15 (a) of the Civil Rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.009" offset="6347964">And certainly, if it was an abuse of discretion for the Court of Appeals to deny an amendment presented for the first time in that Court, then all the more, in our case, where we presented the amendment at the outset of arguments on motions for summary judgment in the District Court, the amendment should have been allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.035" offset="6436049">And I might say that the Court took 14 months to deny our motion to amend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.208" offset="6472829">Our motion to amend was made in February of 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.196" offset="6488712">It was set down for oral argument in April of 1956 and it was not denied by the District Court until April of 1957, a full 14 months after we filed the motion so that it can -- the action of the lower court can hardly be explained or defended on the ground that it would have unfairly delayed disposition of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.021" offset="6604069">The lower court did not contend that the amendment was insubstantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.739" offset="6622877">On the contrary, it said only that in the absence of a showing of mistake, inadvertence, neglect or changed conditions, the amendment should not be allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.001" offset="6667912">These are the criteria which govern the granting of relief from a default judgment and not the criteria which govern the granting of amendments to pleadings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.042" offset="6716082">I pass now to the question of the applicability of Section 5 to split-ups.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.780" offset="6747115">The statutory language itself quite clearly shows that split-ups are not contemplated by Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.764" offset="6787030">It sets forth five classes of transactions, and if my telescope the language but read what I read verbatim, the five classes are as follows, and these are set forth on pages 22 and 23 of our main brief, “For two or more carriers to consolidate or merge their properties or franchises into one corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.202" offset="6892774">Secondly, for any carrier to purchase lease or contract to operate the properties of another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.675" offset="6926629">Third, for any carrier to acquire control of another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.749" offset="6950975">Fourth, for a person which is not a carrier to acquire control of two or more carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.610" offset="6982426">And fifth, for a person which is not a carrier and which has control of one or more carriers to acquire control of another carrier.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.053" offset="7028193">In every instance, we start out with two or more carriers to come within these provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.080" offset="7060271">Now, the Commission in the lower court applied the provision -- the third provision, which I read which is, “For any carrier to acquire control of another”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.704" offset="7118785">And the reasoning of the Commission in the lower court was that on the consummation of this transaction, Golden Gate, which is presently not a carrier, will become a carrier once it gets into the operation of the -- of the service which is proposed to be transferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.958" offset="7203736">It will become a carrier and at that time, it will be controlled by its parent, Greyhound, which is a carrier and therefore, we have claimed by operation bootstrap into a situation of one carrier acquiring control of another carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.803" offset="7287118">Not only does this do violence to the language of Section 5, but it is completely inconsistent with the purposes of Section 5 as clearly shown by the legislative history, as this Court has frequently itself set forth in its opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.264" offset="7360993">This provision, Section 5, as written into the 1940 Transportation Act had, as its purpose, the provision of means of relief for a very sick transportation industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.581" offset="7426299">In the 1920 Act, which was passed when the Government was turning the operation of the railroad back to the companies, Congress had decided upon the approach of imposing on the Interstate Commerce Commission the obligation to formulate plans of consolidation of railroads into a relatively few systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.033" offset="7520131">And once the Commission formulated and announced a consolidation plan, carriers could then initiate mergers and consolidations but that approach never worked because the Commission never got around to formulating a plan of consolidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.937" offset="7595677">So finally, after lengthy studies by presidential committees and congressional committees, in the 1940 Act, this was all changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.482" offset="7649907">The obligation on the Commission to formulate plans was removed and carriers were given the authority to initiate voluntarily, merger and consolidation plans subject to the requirement that they must be approved by the Commission as consistent with the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.697" offset="7730782">The Committee Report show that Congress was dealing with an industry which was described as being one-third in bankruptcy and the other third on the verge, and the need for providing effective and practical means of consolidating weak carriers was urgent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.166" offset="7816568">Obviously, in the case particularly of large carriers, mergers and consolidations could not effectively be carried out if the approval were required of every other regulatory agency which might have jurisdiction over any portion of the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.237" offset="7896921">And for that reason, Congress provided that once approved by the Commission, this merger and consolidation plans could be carried out regardless of the antitrust laws and without invoking the approval of any federal agency or of any state agency.</text>

            <text syncTime="2629.423" offset="10517629">I would like to first to discuss the facts relating to the posture of this case, what has been properly before the District Court and what we believe is properly before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.370" offset="10569456">Now, the court proceeding began on October 1955 and these appellants filed their complaint and it's in the record of pages 1 to 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.912" offset="10607595">And on that complaint, they attacked the Commission's orders solely on a single ground that transactions of this type, split-up as they call it, are not subject to the Commission's jurisdiction under Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.374" offset="10665482">Nothing was said in there about the rate, policies to California Commission, nothing about the sufficiency of the Commission's findings, their support on the evidence or anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.210" offset="10704771">Simply, the question of whether this type of transaction is covered by Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.584" offset="10734237">As the appellants have stated, thereafter both the appellants and the defendants, United States and Interstate Commerce Commission filed motions for judgment in the pleadings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.545" offset="10774152">It was perfectly clear what everybody was doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.424" offset="10789616">The appellants stated in their own motion that they so moved for the reason that the pleadings of the various parties showed that there is no question of fact involved in the case and that the sole question recited is one of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.964" offset="10847817">Plaintiffs did not file to the District Court the record of the evidence received before the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.989" offset="10871954">That evidence is not before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.124" offset="10888464">Then, the case went to argument before the three judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.371" offset="10905391">And it was only in the course of the oral argument before three federal judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.673" offset="10926602">Now, for the first time, we'd heard about this proposal to amend the complaint in the course of the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.611" offset="10962442">The appellant's counsel stated that he intended, "To," and I quote, "To ask leave of the Court in the event the determination of the Court should be against us on the legal question raised to give us permission to amend the complaint, to set forth as an additional ground the challenge of the finding of the Commission that the order in question is consistent with the public interest".</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.992" offset="11051886">And not even at that point, if may I point out, not even at that point did he say anything about challenging the Commission's action in refusing to reopen the case for rehearing and reconsideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.600" offset="11106325">And it was not until February 28, five days after the oral argument before the three-judge court that these appellants filed their motion for leave to amend their complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.739" offset="11162854">The District Court heard argument on this motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.453" offset="11177796">Then on April 12, 1957, the three-judge court handed down its decision.</text>
