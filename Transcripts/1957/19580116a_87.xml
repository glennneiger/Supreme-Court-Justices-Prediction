            <label>Mr. Henry A. Lowenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="12.490" offset="49946">Yes, sir, if Your Honor pleases, if the court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.340" offset="65306">This case comes here on a writ of certiorari to the Federal Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.343" offset="97280">There had been two trials of this indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.134" offset="116506">First trial ended in a judgment of conviction which was unanimously reversed by the Federal Court of Appeals, Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.891" offset="155481">Then there had been a retrial of the case, another judgment of conviction and an affirmance by the Federal Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.747" offset="202919">I might, at the outset, say to Your Honors, that the same witnesses testified in both cases with the following exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.771" offset="250984">That the Government produced witnesses to testify that the narcotics in this case had been disposed of, had been destroyed and therefore could not be produced at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.728" offset="306887">And the Government then offered a new evidence as a part of the government's case, the defendant having rested at the conclusion of the government's case at the first trial and the second trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.754" offset="350981">The previous criminal record of the petitioner would show that in 1942 and this was an indictment charging alleged sales of narcotics in 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.118" offset="412421">That 1952, the petitioner had been convicted of the sale of narcotics and at 1946, he had been convicted of the unlawful purchase of narcotics in violation of Section 2553, not sections 173, 174.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.669" offset="514612">The introduction of those that record was strenuously objected to, was overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.890" offset="543556">The motion for a mistrial denied in other conviction and then the Federal Court of Appeals Second Circuit affirmed the judgment of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.208" offset="592771">Now, the witnesses as I stated to this Court, who testified in the second trial, were the same witnesses who testified in the first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.389" offset="645538">It's our contention one, that the Court erred in not directing a verdict of acquittal on the ground there was entrapment as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.875" offset="691409">And two, the admissibility of this record into evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.232" offset="716904">Thirdly, that if it were admissible it was so remote in time, as to make it absolutely prejudicial and biased to the accused it's offering it into evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.240" offset="776882">Three agents testified for the Government and an informer, a man working with an agent of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.203" offset="828709">And I dare say the Government cannot dispute that this Charles Kalchinian was an informer attached to an agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.121" offset="872385">This Kalchinian had been arrested and convicted of two sales of narcotics in June, 1951 and upon his conviction, he agreed to work with the Federal Bureau of Narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.190" offset="928705">According to the record he built up three cases for the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.944" offset="955768">And he went on just to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.670" offset="970606">At page 100, on cross examination, and when I had a referral back to the question asked of him at the previous trial, and it was your job while working with these agents to go out and try to induce a person to sell narcotics to you, is not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.723" offset="1054824">I would say yes to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.939" offset="1063706">Do you remember that?</text>
            <text syncTime="267.354" offset="1069349">If that's what I said, let us stand that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.787" offset="1083141">Because he had previously said that he didn't recall that kind of testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.445" offset="1105711">Now, the facts were generally these.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.505" offset="1122011">This petitioner was seated in a doctor's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.764" offset="1139043">He was an addict, being treated by this physician for withdrawal treatment for a cure of narcotic addiction by Dr.Grossman who has a speciality in treating narcotic addicts.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.074" offset="1204245">There he saw seated on another chair this government informer.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.900" offset="1227546">They saw each other in a doctor's office a half dozen times, not by their own appointments but because the doctor had asked him to come back at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.690" offset="1270700">After a half a dozen times, the government informer said hello to this petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.154" offset="1296614">They had gone to the same pharmacy to have their prescriptions filled.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.882" offset="1319497">This alleged informer or this informer, I should say, then asked the petitioner about his experiences in using narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.288" offset="1361084">He broached the subject to this addict.</text>

            <text syncTime="474.245" offset="1896908">So, it will cost you 15,” and the defendant retained the other portion of the narcotics.</text>

            <text syncTime="1286.682" offset="5146645">One, that the agent induced the accused to commit the offense charged in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.558" offset="5170155">Two, if so, was the accused ready and willing without persuasion?</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.596" offset="5186351">And was he awaiting any propitious opportunity to commit the offense?</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.008" offset="5204010">On the first question, the accused has the burden, on the second the prosecution has it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.816" offset="5223236">In the case at bar, plainly, Kalchinian did induce the first sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.775" offset="5243089">But that was irrelevant unless at that time the two had made the agreement described above.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.613" offset="5262420">If they did it would be true that the later sales resulted from Kalchinian's original inducement for it meant that he was in a market, so to say, and might buy whenever Sherman had any heroin to offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.528" offset="5310067">Although, as we have said on that issue, Sherman had the affirmative, the evidence to support the defense was ample if indeed not conclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.431" offset="5349669">On the other hand, since the prosecution had the burden upon the issue of the excuse for inducement, it had to satisfy the jury that Sherman did not need any persuasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.104" offset="5392405">But that he stood ready to procure heroin for anyone who asked for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.937" offset="5407660">And the evidence scarcely supported such a finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.797" offset="5423125">So far as appeared, Sherman shared his heroin with Kalchinian as a fellow addict and without profit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1878.280" offset="7513025">Kalchinian would come back to car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.323" offset="7521280">They'd searched him and find narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.026" offset="7532042">They'd put it in a glassine envelope and that initially.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.672" offset="7550642">But they also testified that Sherman was a handyman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.469" offset="7573838">That Sherman earned his living as a handyman and as a collector of rents in a house on West 17th Street.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.710" offset="7610828">They knew that to be his income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.334" offset="7621277">That he was not getting his income from the sale of narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.719" offset="7638831">That here he was legitimately, legally employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.780" offset="7655027">And on the -- the last occasion on November 16th, when they drove Kalchinian uptown to meet Sherman, they gave to Kalchinian listed American currency, took the numbers off the bills and when they saw it pass to Sherman, they trailed Sherman to his home in West 17th Street to his apartment building, to his rooming house, worked in on him and said, “You're under arrest” “What for?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.551" offset="7774145">“Narcotics.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.753" offset="7778952">He denied knowing anything about narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.955" offset="7787729">They said take your money out of your pocket and then among the bills they found this amount of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.551" offset="7810194">They searched him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.323" offset="7813224">They found no narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.815" offset="7819180">They searched his apartment, they found no narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.850" offset="7835376">They found no evidence to the fact that Sherman does not or did not earn his living as a handyman and as a collector of rents and taking care of these premises on West 17th Street.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.535" offset="7890129">Now, that in substance, is the testimony of the agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.322" offset="7913221">And -- and according to their own admissions they weren't concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.138" offset="7936522">They weren't concerned at all as to how that Kalchinian got Sherman to sell or to give him narcotics to put it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.061" offset="7972153">They weren't concerned at all about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.442" offset="7985737">As a matter of fact, (Inaudible) the agent to whom Kalchinian was assigned, on cross examination, at page 29, from 28 to 29 said he wasn't present at any conversation between Kalchinian and the -- the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.337" offset="8081345">And he does not know if Kalchinian would induce anyone to sell him narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.672" offset="8102661">He wasn't concerned with him, neither were the other agents as to how these alleged transfers took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.674" offset="8126694">All they were interested in was the evidence there, nothing else or what comes down to, this meeting of Kalchinian with Sherman in a doctor's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.099" offset="8180297">Now, I dare say that if an addict who goes to a doctor's office has to be fearful of the fact that he may meet the agent of the Government or an informer of the Government in that office, why, he'd be fearful to go there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.661" offset="8302550">And yet our policy is try to readjust and rehabilitate these medically unfortunate, these medically sick people and yet the Government used this man in a doctor's office to entice, to induce Sherman to give him narcotics, at least.</text>

            <text syncTime="2835.395" offset="11341531">But in late August of 1951, he met the defendant in Dr.Grossman's office, and Grossman had a practice of attempting to cure addicts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2913.279" offset="11653016">Answer “Well, we spoke to each other such as many people who go through operations.</text>

            <text syncTime="2959.255" offset="11836918">“After a while, I asked him if there was a reliable man I could met sometime that I needed him and I asked him along those lines.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2983.406" offset="11933571">But I spoke to him again on that subject."</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.200" offset="11944751">And he said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.302" offset="11949140">He couldn't see how I could meet this particular person, this one in particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.427" offset="11969620">And I asked him, why not?</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.401" offset="11977561">And he explained that the man was going out of business turning it over to someone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.187" offset="12000653">And in this change and so on, he didn't think that I could meet him at all.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.274" offset="12024999">“Did you ever tell the defendant the purpose for which you wanted to meet this man?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.928" offset="12043703">Answer “Yes, I told him I was not responding to treatment very well and needed something for myself to maintain myself to a level, but he couldn't see how he could introduce me to him.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.601" offset="12090305">So that it appears that the first approach by Kalchinian to the petitioner was not that the petitioner sell him any narcotics or as Mr. Lowenberg suggests, split any narcotics with me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.045" offset="12144118">All he wanted to do was find out who he could get some for, for his own needs.</text>

            <text syncTime="4083.455" offset="16333740">And perhaps, there was a reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="4084.727" offset="16338860">Maybe, he wanted to make a profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4087.651" offset="16350563">And we -- we contend that in itself indicates some evidence of a predisposition, if the case isn't the same as the one we had here before.</text>
            <text syncTime="4098.082" offset="16392255">Here, there are two discussions about the narcotic addict.</text>
            <text syncTime="4102.377" offset="16409496">It isn't in -- but on the other hand, we have a man who is, admittedly, violating the law with respect to narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="4109.450" offset="16437708">He is buying them.</text>

            <text syncTime="4114.206" offset="16456725">So, he isn't a man too innocent in this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4117.941" offset="16471667">And to show whether he was a -- a person engaged in it we brought the record of his prior convictions, which was a conviction0 for a sale and a conviction for, as I believe, Mr. Lowenberg points out for a purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="4134.770" offset="16539063">Now, those two convictions together with the evidence here that he was a narcotic addict that's why he was going to the doctor, he was able to get the drug.</text>

            <text syncTime="4301.192" offset="17204767">He'd been convicted in 1946.</text>
