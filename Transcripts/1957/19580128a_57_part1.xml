            <text syncTime="65.265" offset="261016">The court below held that the evidence based solely upon the testimony of the managing agent of the respondent company even though changed, corrected, recanted, repudiated by the witness on the stand prior to the completion of his examination, had probative value and was thus legally sufficient to establish affirmative defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.795" offset="387135">And in remand, the Court went even further and held that since this testimony had not been controverted by required testimony on the part of the petitioner, the evidence was not only legal, its sufficient but did as a matter of law conclusively established respondent's affirmative defense and warranted a directed verdict in favor of respondents.</text>
