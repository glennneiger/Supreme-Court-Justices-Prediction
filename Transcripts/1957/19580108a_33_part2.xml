            <label>Mr. Irving M. Walker</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">I'm sorry but I understand your statement -- provided argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.934" offset="31660">I must confess to a sentimental desire on my part not to complete a professional career that run for 50 odd years without having the privilege of addressing this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.733" offset="94877">I have a more substantive reason, however, for presenting an argument at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.244" offset="120895">I should like to emphasize one of the points that are made by the respondents, which it seems to me might be controlling of this case in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.248" offset="164989">I refer particularly, to the question of jurisdiction and more particularly to the contention of the respondents that the constitutional points now are being urged upon the Court by the petitioners were raised too late.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.057" offset="260180">They were not raised in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.721" offset="278883">It's quite too that under the law of California a statement or allegations of fact are all that is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.045" offset="324127">But somewhere along the line, the attention of the Court if constitutional points are involved or federal laws are involved must be called to that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.352" offset="385358">And in the case at bar and notwithstanding the protestations of my learned opponent, these matters were not called to the attention of the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.266" offset="445022">There is a statement in the reply brief to the effect that they were all called to the attention of the Court and I must call attention to the fact that nowhere in this record does it appear that these matters were called to the attention of the trial court as constitutional questions and that the decision of the trial court did not vest upon any of the so-called constitutional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.089" offset="596323">It is true that in the memorandum opinion of the trial judge, there is some reference to the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.274" offset="653061">But it's in the general context of the discussion as to whether or not the plaintiffs in the action had met -- met the obligation to show that there was no justification for the complaint of acts of the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.578" offset="758282">Now, it is said by the petitioners that the judgment of the District Court has denied them due process under the Fourteenth Amendment and an equal protection of the laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="337.518" offset="1350008">The petitioner's complaint, that it is the judgment of the District Court of Appeals that raises these questions of due process and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.867" offset="1407373">Now, if that is true, it was equally true of the judgment of the trial court when the demurrer was sustained without leave to amend as I think counsel has conceded.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.251" offset="1488980">It was inevitable that a judgment of dismissal would be entered unless something was done by the plaintiffs to stay off that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.433" offset="1553659">Then they knew that this judgment which they claim would have or does have this effect was going to be entered and they have the opportunity under the California law and beyond any possible question at anytime before the judgment was entered, to ask the trial court for a reconsideration of this matter and they could then have indicated to the trial court that these constitutional questions were involved and that a judgment such as was indicated would create this cons -- constitutional situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.945" offset="1727739">No such motion for reconsideration was made and the judgment was entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.784" offset="1755115">And in that connection, may I call the Court's attention to what seems to me to be an inconsistency on the part of the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.730" offset="1798896">They say that these problems, these constitutional problems were involved in this case from the out -- outset by reason of the allegations of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.985" offset="1855843">How can that be true if their reliance here is upon a claim that the judgment is the thing that creates the constitutional questions because there they say, came the action on the part of the state which was required in order to make them Fourteenth Amendment questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.728" offset="1958870">Now, there was no element of surprise as far as these gentlemen were concerned in the decision of the District Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.406" offset="2017593">It is true that the trial court did not base its determination upon one of the grounds that was urged by the defendants, the respondents here.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.657" offset="2102544">But the record shows, and I refer to page 27 of the transcript in this Court, to an excerpt on the memorandum of points and authorities in support of the demur of the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.862" offset="2175373">The complaint does not state facts sufficient to -- to constitute a cause of action for interference with business relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.131" offset="2216438">No existing contract between plaintiffs and any of the defendants is alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.641" offset="2242560">Consequently, there must be shown a reasonable probability that but for the alleged interference.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.028" offset="2276101">Business relations between the parties would have been entered into.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.957" offset="2295745">It is not enough that plaintiff's hope or even expected that such relations might eventuate, the fact that they would have eventuated must appear citing authority for the contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.633" offset="2362514">And so, they knew as soon as the first demurrer was filed that this was one of the contentions of the respondents as to the law of this case and might be adopted either in the trial court or in the higher court.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.815" offset="2455197">Now, the effect of the failure on the part of the petitioners to call these federal questions to the attention of the trial court had, I submit, this effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.571" offset="2526250">None of these questions had to be considered by the District Court of Appeals under California practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.404" offset="2565538">They were not considered by the District Court of Appeals on what would have been a perfectly proper ground and not having been to say it -- considered, not having been decided, this Court, I think has no right to consider.</text>

            <text syncTime="1066.017" offset="4264020">The judgments by the court below sustaining the demurrers, to the complaint and dismissing the action without trial deprived appellants of their liberties and properties without due process of law in violation of the due process provisions of the California constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1119.776" offset="4479060">Because they had proceeded as required under the California law and filed their complaint, fought the defendants in the Court and the ordinary steps have been taken that were proper under the procedure of California, resulting in this sustaining of the demurrer without leave to amend and in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.517" offset="4614060">I should add that there was no determination or discussion by the District Court of Appeals of any of these questions and as I have said, it would have been justified and not discussing them because they were not presented in the trial court and because they were not truly presented in the opening brief because following, even this end to which I have called the Court's attention.</text>

            <text syncTime="1353.007" offset="5411944">There is no factual showing of denial of employment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1378.438" offset="5513718">There's not even an allegation that there were any negotiations pending or that any plaintiff was seeking employment in the industry at the time of the alleged tortuous interference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.023" offset="5568052">There is no allegation that at anytime after the making of the agreement, anyone of plaintiff's requested employment from anyone of the defendants or from anyone in the motion picture industry.</text>

            <text syncTime="1416.895" offset="5667527">At the oral argument, counsel for plaintiffs conceded it was not alleged that individual plaintiffs did apply for work and were denied the right to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.155" offset="5712562">So far as it appears, the last efforts of plaintiffs to obtain employment may have occurred years before the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.923" offset="5743595">All that is alleged is that at some unspecified time prior to the agreement they have been so employed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1448.408" offset="5793541">Since the employment terminated some time before the agreement in the absence of contrary allegation, the inference necessarily is that the termination was a result of facts, wholly disconnected from the agreement and that those facts whatever they may have been are still effect -- still are effective.</text>

            <label>Mr. Herman F. Selvin</label>
            <text syncTime="1497.482" offset="5989878">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.709" offset="6010776">It is now clear here as it was in both the trial court and the District Court of Appeals below that this action was and is a common law tort action characterized by Judge Kenny only this morning, as a tort action seeking relief for a concerted refusal to deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.091" offset="6108264">As at page 11 of the reply brief, the petitioners concede, the State of California had no connection whatever, had taken no action in respect of the conduct, the combination or agreement which it is alleged here is unlawful until a judgment of its court dismissing the complaint was entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.664" offset="6230622">Their entire constitutional argument is premised not on the fact that in some way the California court, in this case, denied them procedural due process, not on the fact that the California court upheld against constitutional challenge, some action of some other agency or department of the State of California, but solely and simply and wholly on the fact that by rendering its judgment of dismissal, the Court deprived these petitioners of their constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.424" offset="6381610">I should think therefore that it would be a matter of some significance to know precisely what it was that the California court, the District Court of Appeals to whom this certiorari runs decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.534" offset="6442109">It held -- it affirmed the judgment of dismissal upon one ground and one ground alone that it did not appear from the complaint construed as it was required to be construed under the California practice that the injury claimed by these petitioners had been brought about by or was the result of the challenged combination or agreement and that's all there was to the decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.685" offset="6582648">The Court expressly stated that in view of that conclusion, we do not reach the other contentions made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.000" offset="6615980">It treated the case as a simple and conventional tort case decided it on what we have characterized in our briefs as on the question of standing to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.997" offset="6655896">They haven't been hurt for the combination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.745" offset="6662896">They haven't shown they were hurt by it and therefore there were no position to challenge it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.679" offset="6686616">Now, from that common law tort decision, Mr. Margolis has argued this morning, there arises a denial of equal protection, a denial of equal protection because in his view, James against Marinship should have controlled rather than the cases which the District Court of Appeals purported to follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.988" offset="6779925">Now, it has been many times said and held in this Court that an erroneous decision of state law, even an inconsistent decision of state law inconsistent with prior decisions of a state raises no question under either the due process or the Equal Protection Clauses of the Constitution and that's for a very obvious reason because otherwise this Court would have power and jurisdiction to review every decision of a state court on any and every subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.608" offset="6910328">Mr. Margolis says that the classification is an unreasonable one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.071" offset="6932271">We say in the first place that is not a reviewable question here because he is complaining not of a classification upheld by the state court as the result of the action of some other state agency, but of the classification made by the Court itself in handing down this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.121" offset="7004473">But the classification is unreasonable that it can be defended within the broad limits of classification that this Court has supported the States under the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.841" offset="7039269">What do the State do?</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.395" offset="7045538">In James against Marinship which is the case upon which Mr. Margolis depends, the Supreme Court of California held that a combination of employers and a closed union, a union which he excluded colored people from membership could not, under the California common law, enter into a close shop agreement, so that colored employees actually employed at that time and excluded from membership in the union would loose their existing employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.715" offset="7194854">That was the decision in James against Marinship and it was a decision as matter of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.312" offset="7225156">In our case, the Court simply held that persons who have no existing employment, who failed to show any reasonable prospect of existing employment, had no standing to sue in respect of a combination or agreement which is alleged was arbitrary and unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.787" offset="7303105">On the one -- on the one hand in the class are those who have an existing or established or reasonably perspective employment, on the other are those who do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.803" offset="7339154">As to the first class, the State of California says, “You have a cause of action if you prove those facts”, as to the other, the State of California says, “You have no cause of action because you haven't proved the one necessary element that will bring you over on the other class.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.695" offset="7394743">And that, we submit, Your Honor is a reason classification, even assuming that this Court can properly consider the equal protection question with respect to the decision of the California court on a question of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.752" offset="7459004">The Court did not directly or indirectly or by any intimation decide that this challenge combination was or was not lawful either under state law or under federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.843" offset="7515324">For all we know today, when persons appropriately situated so as to be able to raise the question, challenge this combination if it still exists in a California court, the California court may hold that it is violative of -- of state law or of federal law --</text>

            <text syncTime="2494.061" offset="9976163">Their contention now is that that dismissal even on a state ground, constituted a denial of the constitutional rights which they assert they set up in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.556" offset="10026214">Now, if that dismissal hands that effect, certainly, the latest time at which they should have challenged it was when they were informed that that was going to be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.065" offset="10072189">And the memorandum opinion informed them it was going to be done, not on constitutional grounds, I agree, but the fact that it was not on constitutional ground does not determine the argument that the petitioners are making.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.997" offset="10131958">They say regardless of the ground upon which the trial court dismissed this complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.979" offset="10155886">The dismissal in the face of these allegations was a denial of due process of equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.532" offset="10178038">And if that's so, why then it sometime at the earliest opportunity after that became apparent, they were required to challenge it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.127" offset="10212415">They could have challenge at the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.154" offset="10220565">They didn't challenge it in the Court of Appeal until a petition for rehearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2568.036" offset="10272078">Part of your argument is -- is at the point that Mr. Walker gets it, namely, that in the Superior Court -- Superior Court exposed of this complaint on a professed state ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.559" offset="10334145">It entered an appeal to the District Court and under your law, under California procedure if they claim that the judgment in the Superior Court denied their federal claim here, properly brought to the attention of the Superior Court in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.441" offset="10425678">That although the -- the Superior Court confess to go on a state ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.719" offset="10446785">They still insist that there's a federal claim which they have a right to have enforce by appropriate appeal in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.816" offset="10483252">That's the question of the procedural mode by which a federal question must be brought before a state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.919" offset="10507598">That's a very different question as I gather.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.956" offset="10515749">There's nothing to do as to whether or not what the court of California here did was before we say that under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2639.222" offset="10556813">It's a quite a different question and I have discussed and duplicated Mr. Walker's discussion in response to questions that I haven't intended myself to get into it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.172" offset="10608640">But getting to the Fourteenth Amendment question, basically, petitioner's case has rested on the asserted unlawfulness of this combination or agreement or conspiracy or whatever you want to call it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.529" offset="10698083">And the question therefore, it seems to me, which must be answered is whether such an agreement by private individuals gives them a cause of action directly under the Fourteenth Amendment and without reference to any other legislation or implementing constitutional provisions of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.118" offset="10808424">The answer to that question, is no, it does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.302" offset="10833189">It does not because at least one thing has been repeated many times in this Court without substantial dissent and that that the Fourteenth Amendment is a restriction against the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.055" offset="10896196">It creates no rights as between individual and individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.869" offset="10919393">That general proposition has been applied in a context peculiarly appropriate to this case and in a number of cases which I am -- should render the State, do no appear in our brief but to which I should like to direct the special attention of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.518" offset="10993998">As we all know, we've had for sometime federal legislation which makes it both crime and a civil cause of action at least to the federal court or two or more persons to conspire, to intimidate, threaten or oppress any citizen in a free exercise of a right or privilege secured or protected by the constitution or laws of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.123" offset="11092428">In Hodges versus United States, 203 U.S. 1, it was held that that legislation was inapplicable to a conspiracy to deprive a certain class of citizens of their jobs of the right to pursue their colleagues because the constitutional power or jurisdiction of the Congress under the Fourteenth Amendment did not go that far, to protecting individuals against individual exertions of arbitrary or discriminatory power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.881" offset="11239445">In United States versus Wheeler, 254 U.S. 281, an indictment for a conspiracy to deport citizens from one state to another and exclude them from the state against private individual was held that for the same reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.652" offset="11318544">In United States against Williams 341 U.S. 70, involving the coerced confession by third degree methods obtained by private individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.231" offset="11376849">It was held that the rights which the Congress could constitutionally protect as against the action of individuals excluded those rights, which the Constitution secured only against State interference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.649" offset="11458560">Now, if the Fourteenth Amendment does not protect the work, the right to work or any other right or immunity which as against the States, it protects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.516" offset="11502028">If it does not protect it against individual conduct then this combination or agreement cannot be unlawful simply by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.345" offset="11565349">It is not unconstitutional because it is individual action and if that is so, when the District Court of Appeal held, if it did so hold, that petitioners constitutional rights were not infringed under the Fourteenth Amendment by it, its action was not unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.197" offset="11648731">We can't assume, in view of the silence of the District Court of Appeal with respect to these constitutional questions, a silence induced, we say, because the questions were never raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.464" offset="11697842">We can't assume that the Court held anymore than what I have just said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.005" offset="11723964">They were asked to hold but this complaint stated a cause of action for damages and for injunctive relief in respect of a concerted combination not to deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.456" offset="11765760">It held expressly that there was no cause of action because injury was not shown or followed from the alleged wrongful act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.451" offset="11797734">It held, according to petitioners by necessary implication although certainly not expressly that the combination was not unlawful for the other reasons and that is perfectly consistent with the view of the Fourteenth Amendment to which I've referred, and if that's it held, it correctly decided the Fourteenth Amendment question and its decision cannot therefore be said in itself to be unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="2983.552" offset="11934198">I should say, it would depend on the manner of the upholding and it was just to that that I was coming, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.077" offset="11964291">In the restrictive covenant cases, in Shelly against Kraemer, Barrows against Jackson, it seems to me that what this Court did is best typified by just two or three sentences from the opinion in Barrows, explaining what the Court had done in Shelly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.799" offset="12055092">Under the applicable law, these covenants are not invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.329" offset="12077244">No one will be punished for voluntarily adhering to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.742" offset="12094903">Therefore, no one's constitutional rights are infringed by them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.016" offset="12116010">But then the Court went on to say, of course, there was something more in this case than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.003" offset="12135967">The State's coercive power was put behind the covenant by injunctive restraint and mandate in Shelly, by request for damages which the California court refused in Barrows, so that the covenants there were no longer voluntarily covenants -- voluntarily adhered to but were because of the action taken by the state court and would on all other cases have been because of the action taken by the state court, covenants, performance of which could have been compelled in a way that action is always and ordinarily compelled through the use of state sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.203" offset="12292807">But the implications of Shelly and Barrows all converge upon the proposition, that where all that the State does is to tolerate these covenants or agreements, does not put behind them the coercive power of the State to compel performance of them that then you have not state action under the Fourteenth Amendment, but only individual action or state in action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.143" offset="12404506">Now, I say the implications converged on that proposition, I gather that in the first instance from the care with which the Court differentiated the mere validity of the covenants in themselves from the situation which was produced when the Court enforced the covenants from the way in which in the opinion of the Court contrasted the terms State in action and action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.762" offset="12514952">More particularly, however, I think those implications come from the whole history of the Fourteenth Amendment in this Court, for if, if mere state toleration of private conduct but short of sanctioning the conduct becomes state action under the Fourteenth Amendment, then virtually all private conduct is such.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.872" offset="12635429">Because all private conduct not declared unlawful by positive state law is conduct which is tolerated by the State but if that's all the State does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.314" offset="12689241">And if it does not put behind it the sanctions of its civil or penal law, it is still private conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.274" offset="12721006">In other words, as I say, we do what this Court consistently, since this Waterhouse case has refused to do, turned the Fourteenth Amendment into a municipal code for the governing of individual action instead of a restriction upon the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.787" offset="12791118">And while I realize, Your Honor, that it is presumptuous to attempt to tell a Court which decided the case, what it meant by the case, I think, I should like to have a word or two to say about Marsh against Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.507" offset="12873979">As I read Marsh against Alabama, the state action involve in that case, the state action that was expressly held it to be unconstitutional was not this individual conduct of the managers of the corporation in excluding these Jehovah's Witness from the streets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.798" offset="12927164">It was the act of the State of Alabama in putting its criminal law behind that individual act of the managers and sending the Jehovah's Witness to jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.763" offset="13003024">And this Court expressly stated, in Mr. Justice Black's opinion, that insofar as the State has put its power behind this conduct by its penal statute, its action cannot stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.678" offset="13070629">Where is the state action?</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.373" offset="13077420">There it just does in Shelly against Kraemer, the private conduct was implemented by the coercive power of the State, in that case, the criminal sanction in Shelly and Barrows by the civil sanction.</text>

            <text syncTime="3324.573" offset="13298207">Now, of course, a judge -- judgment -- judicial action can be state action but it must -- I think must be tested by Fourteenth Amendment standards in appropriate cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.286" offset="13349094">But when a court -- all that a court does, when all that the court does is to say, nothing in the positive law of the State of California makes an agreement of this sort invalid so long as it is voluntarily adhered to, California isn't enforcing that agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.667" offset="13422655">It isn't putting a sanction behind the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.624" offset="13434462">It is simply, shrugging its shoulders in effect and saying private conduct will be private conduct and it may be distasteful private conduct, it may be calling private conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.244" offset="13484931">It may even be conduct which if it were undertaken by the State, would bring it within the undertakers of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3503.301" offset="14013127">The basic purpose, as I see into the Fourteenth Amendment was to keep -- secure the human individual and his personal freedom and the freedom to express himself in whatever ways within broad limits, his talent, his temperament, his personality may dictate it, to lay room in this country for all shapes and varieties of opinion and conduct without arbitrary or unreasonable interference from the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.157" offset="14160562">And accordingly, the Fourteenth Amendment was designably prepared as a restriction upon the State's power to interfere with that individual freedom again within broad limits, not as a restriction on the individual to be as free as consistently with the policy of the State in which he lives, he desires to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.585" offset="14266305">And I respectfully submit that to make of the Fourteenth Amendment the same kind of a restriction on the individual that it is on to states is not to follow the Fourteenth Amendment but to support its great purpose.</text>
