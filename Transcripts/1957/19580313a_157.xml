            <text syncTime="30.612" offset="122358">Mr. Leighton, you may proceed now.</text>

            <label>Mr. George N. Leighton</label>
            <text syncTime="33.846" offset="135314">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.986" offset="147853">This case is before this Court on grant of certiorari to review judgment of the Supreme Court of Illinois in which the conviction of the defendant in the Criminal Court of Cook County was affirmed and a death sentence imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.031" offset="224026">The federal question which is presented here is whether under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, a state can construe the alleged criminal acts of a defendant so as to indict him under four separate indictments, try him four times introducing in evidence against him the same proof showing that he committed four offenses which the state contends are distinct crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.698" offset="350772">Now, if I may be allowed a moment to state the facts of which this question arises, if Your Honors please.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.335" offset="373238">Vincent Ciucci was indicted in the Criminal Court of Cook County charged with the murder of his wife and three children and the incident giving rise to the indictments occurred in the early morning hours of December 5, 1953 when his home was discovered on fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.666" offset="458606">The firemen found his wife and his three children dead in the little home they occupied as part of a store that was owned and operated by the Ciucci family.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.517" offset="510015">Ciucci first was indicted separately for the murder of his wife and he was tried in a separate trial and he was found guilty and sentenced to a term of 20 years in the Illinois State Penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.507" offset="561946">The State of Illinois does not contradict the facts that at that first trial there was introduced in evidence all of the facts showing the killing of four persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.591" offset="618266">The jury considered all these evidence and returned a verdict of guilty and sentenced Ciucci to 20 years imprisonment in the Illinois State Penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.709" offset="658808">As soon as that happened the prosecutor for Cook County announced in the newspapers that this was a miscarriage of justice and that he, the prosecutor, was going to see to it that some jury was found that would impose what he thought was an adequate penalty for this crime which he thought enormous.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="185.031" stopTime="189.203">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="185.031" offset="740101">Are those statements in the newspapers controverted by the State anyway?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="george_n_leighton" startTime="189.203" stopTime="351.103">
            <label>Mr. George N. Leighton</label>
            <text syncTime="189.203" offset="756715">They are not, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.756" offset="766955">Now, they proceeded to try him the second time and it is not contradicted that at the second trial, they introduced the same proof that they had submitted to the jury in the first case.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.633" offset="822439">And the jury again, considered the evidence from all that appears adequately and properly and returned a verdict of guilty and sentenced him this time for the murder of his oldest daughter Angeline to a term of 45 years in the Illinois State Penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.740" offset="882939">Contemporaneous with that, the prosecutor announced in the newspapers that this also was a miscarriage of justice and that he said, he thought that some jury ought to see what he thought in the matter that only death was a proper penalty for Ciucci.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.386" offset="945528">Now, it happens that in the first trial, they discovered there was some inconsistency in the proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.715" offset="978860">There was some question where these three persons had met their deaths by inhalation of carbon monoxide or whether they had come to their deaths by shooting.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.589" offset="1018253">So that, the State's attorney while the three remaining of the four indictments obtained in 1953 remained pending, went before the grand jury and obtained three others.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.476" offset="1057855">So, as we point out in this brief at one time, Ciucci had been under six separate indictments charging him with three separate crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.547" offset="1094113">In April of 1954 on motion of the prosecution, three of the remaining indictments obtained in 1953 with nolle prosequi on motion of the State and there remained the three indictments obtained in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.923" offset="1159628">After the second trial in which Ciucci was found guilty and sentenced to 45 years in the Illinois State Penitentiary, again, the prosecutor announced this was not satisfactory.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.550" offset="1202155">And he proceeded then to try him a third time under the indictment charging him with the murder of his son, Vincent, Jr.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.066" offset="1236219">This time when the trial had gone on in a few days a mishap occurred and a mistrial was declared on motion of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.519" offset="1270073">And then the fourth trial was begun.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.827" offset="1279269">And I think that it is clear from this record, and certainly all of us who have had experience in the trial of criminal cases known, that by the simple process of rearranging the evidence they finally -- as we argue here, found an arrangement of the evidence, the same proof, the same evidence, but a rearrangement of it by this experience of three trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.498" offset="1373936">They found an arrangement which convinced the jury that this crime was of the enormity deserving the extreme penalty.</text>

            <text syncTime="470.226" offset="1880816">If a state says "In fairness to the Defendant, we do not allow him to be charged with the murder of more than one human being, and that he can't be put on trial for the murder of two people before that may have," -- I should think it might easily have "a prejudicial influence upon the jury as against the State who does allow such a trial, chooses not to try the defendant that way but chooses to try him in possession if he commits more than one murder."

            <text syncTime="511.047" offset="2044134">I think we'd all agree with that, Your Honor except that it sounds a bit inversed if the State were reasoning in that way, to say that they wouldn't impose upon him a trial in which there is alleged in the indictment, several murders but then at the proof of the case on a construction of a rule of evidence of Illinois as they did in this case relying on People versus Murphy the doctrine of res gestae which is the knob of the contention of the State, that under the doctrine of res gestae, though -- and this is where the State's position in my judgment is a -- inconsistent and indefensible.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.190" offset="2204735">They say on one hand these are separate and distinct crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.300" offset="2221140">But then they said, "And the record is clear and the position of the State of Illinois hasn't changed one with from the beginning to the day."</text>

            <text syncTime="1251.561" offset="5006211">Authorities on the subject, students of this subject have asked the question, "Why is it that in civil proceeding we don't allow a party who has a cause of action against another party arising out of the same transaction to chop up his cause of action and try it at his own whim and go on before one jury and rearranging his proof at his own discretion and his own arraignment?"</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.635" offset="5114462">We don't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.793" offset="5119164">In fact it is almost consistent throughout the country that in civil cases we require the individual with a -- with a cause of action to bring his case at that time, otherwise, he shall be barred under the doctrine of res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.491" offset="5169946">Now, the question I raise in this case, why should the State of Illinois have greater rights than individual members of its sovereign body?</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.758" offset="5202965">What is it about the criminal law administration that will allow a -- a digression from what is uniformly considered?</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.890" offset="5235461">Just a simple fairness, that if you have a case against the man bring it all at one time so you may have his one day in Court and defend himself.</text>
