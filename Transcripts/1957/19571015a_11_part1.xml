            <label>Mr. William J. Isaacson</label>
            <text syncTime="23.143" offset="92473">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.298" offset="113162">This case is here under writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.649" offset="138553">Petitioners here are the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, the labor organization and 10 individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.250" offset="176901">Three of these individuals are representatives of the Amalgamated or are employed by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.144" offset="204487">Seven of these petitioners are employees of the Rainfair, Incorporated, a company involved in this proceeding and made application for membership to be Amalgamated and designated it as their bargaining representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.215" offset="288810">Rainfair, the company here, has two plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.336" offset="305319">One of which is in the Racine, Wisconsin and one, in Wynne, Arkansas, a small community in the Eastern half of that State.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.323" offset="349205">If the plant in Wynne, Arkansas which is involved in this proceeding and only that plant, as to that -- as to the fact that Rainfair is engaged in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.540" offset="418064">There is no denial of it, and as a matter of fact, it was submitted in this brief of my opponent in behalf of Rainfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.737" offset="454844">The Company at Wynne, Arkansas employees, time is a controversy, came into being some 107 people, predominantly women.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.288" offset="505104">At the time of the strike, which I have come in a moment which is the key question here, there were some 87 people, 80 of whom were women.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.555" offset="554214">Throughout all of the proceeding here, I shall discuss that the plant was mostly women.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.170" offset="592666">Now, the injunction issued by a trial court (Inaudible) from engaging in any activity at -- engaged near the plant of Rainfair (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="181.328" offset="725264">This included or this precluded rather, the picketing that precluded assembly on a vacant lot across these premises and it precluded any form of speech near the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.883" offset="799451">This injunction was challenged by the trial court and in the court below on two basic grounds and the court below -- the court -- Supreme Court of Arkansas, a challenge was made on the ground that this injunction contravene this assembly, that the petitioner held under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.413" offset="901642">Secondly, an independent ground, it was challenged on the ground of the Supreme Court that the trial court here had cut across, interferes with protected activities under the National Labor Relations Act or had taken upon itself the function of the Labor Board, function exclusively that of the Labor Board to cross this unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.685" offset="1042704">On March 19, 1956, the Supreme Court of Arkansas upheld and affirmed the injunctions which I described, primarily and substantially on the ground of striking in their activities during a strike from June 20 to June 24, had a view in strike breakers and is the views to perform substantially of calling the strike breakers scabs and variance of that term.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.915" offset="1207589">There -- the complaint by the company in the trial court on which the ex parte injunction first granted and finally the permanent injunction, the complaint alleged that the objective of these activities were illegal under Arkansas law, first, that it was contrary to their right to work constitutional amendment in enabling statute, and that also that these activities were illegal because they were for the purposes of coercing the employee to join an organization or rather coercing the employer, coerce the employee to join the organization contrary to their desires.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.913" offset="1407582">The Supreme Court of Arkansas, which is the only Court in petition in the opinion in this proceeding, did not find either of the objectives to be illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.213" offset="1444780">It did not discuss it in terms of objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.841" offset="1459304">The Supreme Court in Arkansas found, as to the Fourteenth Amendment question that we raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.724" offset="1498802">They found that the Fourteenth Amendment did not protect these activities here because as they say the act of -- even if they conceded that the acts of violence involved here fall in that category, the category of isolated episodic act, there was nothing isolated or infrequent about persistent abuse, insults, etiquette along the picket line.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.416" offset="1605590">Many jurisdictions have authorized such injunctions with the strikers' acts and conduct had been so entangled with violence, another illegal conduct, that future excesses might reasonably be anticipated in light of what is previously done.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.267" offset="1665045">The conduct, as I initially stated, to which this Court makes reference at this point was substantially and basically the calling of the strike breakers as they entered and left the plant, scabs and variance of that term.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.055" offset="1736202">The Court, so far as the preemption question is concerned, said that while they realized that the ultimate decision would have to be made by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.899" offset="1783536">Then went on to say, so far the state courts had been unanimous in holding that the National Labor Relations Act does not preclude them from granting injunctive relief against picketing in a manner that is unlawful under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.670" offset="1846648">Until, otherwise told, we shall assume that it was not the purpose of the federal act to deprive a state court of its ancient jurisdiction in such matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.571" offset="1882279">These are the basic holdings of the Court on which this all embrace the injunction was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.985" offset="1931912">Now, the facts which led up to the strike which is an issue here are briefly these.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.431" offset="1957721">In the early part of 1955, the Amalgamated Clothing Workers proceeded to attempt to organize these employees, at that organization met with some success that demonstrated in a number of ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.389" offset="2029505">The organization by April was in a position where they thought they could go to the employer and make a request for exclusive recognition as a bargaining agent and there is evidence that during a -- peace meeting with the employer, they stated that they represent the majority of the employees as many as 80.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.531" offset="2114038">The employer, however, sought it not to recognize the union and instead engaged in what the petitioner, Amalgamated, regarded as unfair labor practices because on April the 5th, charges were filed with the National Labor Relations Board at the sub-regional office of Memphis to the -- Tennessee, to the effect that these activities constitute on the part of the company in response to the union's organizational campaign and request for recognition, constituted interference, straight coercion in the terms of statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.386" offset="2281535">Subsequently, sometime in the month of April, there was a petition for an election filed by the Amalgamated.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.390" offset="2313509">This petition, however, withdrawn in the light of what the organization, the Amalgamated, considered to be the unfair labor practices continuation of those unfair labor practice on the part of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.686" offset="2362723">Apparently, there was a feeling that it could not be an untrammeled choice at this particular time in the light of these unfair labor practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.721" offset="2402847">On the 2nd of May, there was a strike called by the Amalgamated, 29 persons went out on that strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.647" offset="2454570">The day that the strike was called, the employer countered with a letter to the strikers, to the effect that if they did not return to work, that they -- places would be failed, and there will be no jobs for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.964" offset="2507755">As the result of this letter, some three persons did return to work, the other 26 continued on strike until May the 19th, when the realization came upon the organization and these persons were a part of -- of this strike, that this was not a strike which could be successful.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.119" offset="2576405">On that day, they abandoned the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.239" offset="2588944">So, advised, the employer of the strike was abandoned and asked that all of these persons be reinstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.113" offset="2616424">The company was so apprised of that fact on the 19th of May.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.313" offset="2637218">The company, however, although that they had not replaced all of these persons, as a matter of fact they hired some 13 persons, the testimony developed in the proceeding before the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.525" offset="2690090">Although they hired some 13 persons, they nevertheless sought it not to take on any of these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.952" offset="2723736">As a result of this, additional charges were filed, amended charges were filed broadening the initial charge to include an 83 on the ground of -- there had been discrimination in view of the company's refusal to reinstate these particular persons when they've made their offer, after their sort of activity have come to end.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.836" offset="2819344">And there was an additional charge filed between the charge, the general interference, and the restrain charge and that which I now described of a refusal of bargain in the interval.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.242" offset="2868872">So, by this time on June the 6th, we have charges now of interference restraint and coercion, refusal of bargain and discrimination by virtue of this failure to reinstate -- refusal to reinstate of these persons, these 15 persons were part of the 26 on the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.485" offset="2957897">The company nevertheless, did not reinstate any of these employees and consequently, on June the 28th, the union went out on strike again.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.159" offset="3008575">I say consequently because I don't think that there's any dispute that the union strike on June the 20th was because of the, that they consider it to be the company's unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.520" offset="3057998">As a matter of fact, the brief of the company, it's described in this way on pages 3 and 4 of the brief of the company, described this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.831" offset="3099272">Bottom page 3, on June 17, 1955 the strikers met with several staff members of the union of Forrest City Arkansas and vote to reestablish the picket line because Rainfair refused to reinstate the strikers or for continuing unfair labor practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.759" offset="3207001">The strike which began on June the 20th and which terminated on June 24th on an ex parte injunction is the only strike and only picketing activity which is before -- which was before the court in Arkansas, and now before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.618" offset="3282442">The -- at this strike, we do not have the precise numbers that engaged these strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.823" offset="3311282">It was a presumably, something less told than the 26 employees who have not been reinstated because some of these 26 had gone off to other job.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.425" offset="3349629">There are no additional adherence to this strike activity at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.315" offset="3373244">So, there was something less than 26 employees who are now out on strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.167" offset="3400620">This strike continued until, as I said, until the 24th, when the ex parte injunction was granted -- granted on the faces of a verified complaint, verified by the plant manager and according to the record, oral testimony by the plant manager.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.555" offset="3474181">There was a hearing held on this injunction on the 1st of July, and on September the 15th, this injunction was made permanent.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.830" offset="3523291">On the 15th also, and I refer to this only because the point that was made in the brief of counsel for the company, they also dismissed a contempt by taking, which had been heard on July the 20th against two youngsters who had broken some bottles in the vicinity of the plant sometime during the month of July.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.912" offset="3623602">And this -- after -- after the strike was concluded and that the -- this activity was in contempt with the Court decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.602" offset="3658397">The Court did not find so however.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.705" offset="3666756">However, there is in fact some reference to it, some lengths, as a matter of fact in the brief for the company here.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.025" offset="3716075">At this point, faced now with the September the 15th, faced with a permanent injunction and realizing and recognizing that there would be tending delay on appellate review in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.202" offset="3772709">The union came to the conclusion that the only thing that could salvage out of this proceeding, was to go to an immediate election.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.315" offset="3813251">This -- they decided to do, and there was a stipulation for an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.549" offset="3842194">On that -- on that, election held on October the 19th, some 57 people voted against the union and 48 people voted for the union even though, there has been an injunction in effect for all these several months.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.954" offset="3903739">Nevertheless, there were some 48 persons, who still adhere to their original affiliation with the organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.353" offset="3937384">Some 15 persons voted what the Board refers to as challenged ballots that as they're committed to vote but their ballots are -- their ballots are sequestered from the ballots to which no challenge was made and helpful examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.712" offset="4006766">These challenge ballots were subsequently, several months later, not to be entitled to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.247" offset="4040934">As I've said on March the 19th, in Supreme Court of Arkansas, affirmed the injunction of the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.115" offset="4088372">Subsequently, to the affirmation of the injunction, the last act, when the proceeding, so far as this Court is concerned, took place and that is that there was a settlement of the charges which the National Labor Relations Board amended, a settlement providing with the -- the posting of a notice on the bulletin board of the company and that notice provided that the company would not interfere, restrain or coerce the employees, would not interrogate the employees and that it would not permit the Wynne Industrial Development Corporation, a group of businessmen in Wynne, to use the premises of the company for purpose of interference and restraint and they would not hold them out as the agents of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.792" offset="4307069">Obviously, I cannot give this Court, that it's not a matter of record, the precise detail which led up to the settlement that prompt the company to enter into this kind of settlement at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.977" offset="4367882">That is not before the -- that is not before us now because it is not a part of the record in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.669" offset="4398602">Have there been a Labor Board proceeding and undoubtedly it would have been made a -- a part of a formal transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.562" offset="4434233">Now, as to the precise -- as to the strike itself to which the challenge is made by the employer in its complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.170" offset="4468611">As I've said, there would -- there was a picketing -- there was picketing in May of 1955, May the 2nd, May 19th which was brought to an end by the realization that the strike could not succeed.</text>
