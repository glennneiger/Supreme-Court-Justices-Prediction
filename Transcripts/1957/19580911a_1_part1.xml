            <text syncTime="34.553" offset="138136">The petition was filed on September 8, 1958 in accordance with the order of the Court of August 28, 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.555" offset="186201">The briefs of petitioners and respondents were timely filed on September 9th and 10th respectively.</text>

            <text syncTime="204.445" offset="817737">Thank you Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice and justices of the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.080" offset="840307">For the record and in view of the Court's ruling that amicus curiae briefs will not be permitted, we would like for the record to show, however, that it has been the position of these petitioners for this writ, not to withhold their consent for any amicus curiae brief to be filed by any proper person.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.488" offset="953887">We have had them submitted to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.305" offset="961202">I'm afraid that all of them have not come to our attention particularly, and we have perhaps not responded to those, but for this record we would like to state that we have no objection to any briefs amicus curiae being filed and being considered by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.665" offset="1050645">We have stated the issues as we see them in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.362" offset="1089411">We see no particular reason at this time to read those.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.756" offset="1110936">We've tired to state them as succinctly and yet as fully as we believe this Court would have us do.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.144" offset="1160568">We believe that the manner and the methods employed by the United States Supreme Court in the two Brown decisions of 1954 and 1955 recognized the complexities of this problem as had previous courts in determining issues of a similar nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.542" offset="1262132">Both of the Brown decisions in our opinion reflect an understanding by this Court of the history of the Negro race and of the cultural patterns throughout this land.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.212" offset="1336842">As Mr. Blossom, the Superintendent of The Little Rock school board stated and we quoted him in the brief and we quoted him at the last hearing, he has set forth we think an accurate outline of the history of this minority group within this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.763" offset="1446975">And briefly it is this that from 1619 to 1865 history shows that there was slavery in this land.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.188" offset="1496712">That is a period of two-and-a-half centauries.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.485" offset="1513848">From 1865 to 1896, I believe the way he termed it and some historians termed it as enforced citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.335" offset="1561287">That was a period of 31 years, ending as he viewed it and as we view it, and as many historians view it, by the case of Plessy versus Ferguson which announced separate but equal doctrine insofar as educational processes in this country are concerned, public education.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard C. Butler</label>
            <text syncTime="443.633" offset="1774446">But the dictum in the case was the first that I'm aware of where the doctrine of separate but equal facilities was held to be constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.025" offset="1840065">Then from 1896 until 1954, of course this country operated under that doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.413" offset="1873607">That was a period of 58 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.028" offset="1888026">From 1954 until now and into the future, there are question marks of course, as to the period of time that effective education can pass from the transition period, from the separate but equal doctrine into complete desegregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.781" offset="2003069">We believe that this Court recognized that time was required for certain cultural patterns to change, and that obviously this Court recognized the necessity or at least the desirability of referring those matters to the local district courts for innumerable problems which this Court recognized would arise and some of which were enumerated in the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.422" offset="2157610">Deliberate speed as used by this Court is certainly not just a phrase coined on the spur of the moment or developed as a philosophy of opportunism to solve an immediate problem, but instead to us it was a carefully conceived philosophy of deliberation, which along for legal reasons for delay, as outlined by this Court in the second Brown decision, allows for the flexibility and the delay provided in the decision by District Judge Harry J. Lemley.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.020" offset="2308075">In effect it provides for a transition from one era to another or from one set of standards to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.167" offset="2376620">Now I invite the Court's attention to this quotation “and if you go back to the Brown decision and study its terms, you will see that this Court with due regard for the almost inestimable value of the public schools to the American people, used every care that it could conceive to try to protect that system provided that the people who were trying to work in the public school system and the state officials had a duty also to preserve it in accordance with the Constitution of the United States and set about the task to try to carry out the Brown decision in good faith at every step of the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.889" offset="2563553">We all know as lawyers and the public knows it from its experience that the courts have had equitable principles that they have worked with over the centuries and the Court in the Brown case in a note refers to that fact, the decision of this Court in which that is set out.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.454" offset="2653727">And a court of equity does not ask people any time or any place to do things that are beyond their power, things that they cannot do.”</text>
            <text syncTime="675.941" offset="2703673">That ends the quotation and those are not our words, but those are the words of the honorable Solicitor General at the last hearing on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.262" offset="2756963">No one has ever questioned the good faith of the Little Rock school board.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.223" offset="2780891">It has been admitted from time to time by counsel for NAACP by the honorable Solicitor General by every court before which this board has appeared, and is implicit in some of the comments made by the justices at this last hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.662" offset="2870648">Again we find in the words of the honorable Solicitor General and I am sure that this Court in the decision in the Brown case in its implementation did not want in any way to loose the public school system in obtaining and enforcing this principle of constitutional law.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.365" offset="2953404">There is ample provision in the Brown case implementing the declaration about constitutional law for time if it is actually needed in good faith to try to carry out this constitutional principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.521" offset="3018083">It is all there and no court of equity in this country would fail to recognize those needs if they are properly brought to its attention and if the action is in good faith and everybody according to basic principles of equitable law has done everything within his power up to that point to accomplish the court's decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.701" offset="3118707">That is when an equity court comes in and acts to help out someone who has tried and done his level best in accordance with all the means at his command and then ask for some help or relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.155" offset="3184536">Again I state that is a quotation from the honorable Solicitor General made before this Court two weeks ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.394" offset="3225496">Now as that -- with that as a background or as a statement which of course we are willing to accept, Judge Lemley, who heard the decision -- who heard the evidence before he rendered his decision after a trial of some three days and after briefs had been submitted, made these statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.203" offset="3324761">Now if Your Honors please, Judge Lemley's decision in our opinion is so important.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.306" offset="3353182">It so well considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.399" offset="3361541">It's so effectively gives the background of the trials and tribulations of the school board in operating a public school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.671" offset="3414622">And the evidence is so clear in that case and he outlines it, although he takes some 19 pages to write his opinion, we feel so strongly that that should be carefully considered by every individual member of this Court that by quoting only short portions of it in our oral argument we trust that the Court will not believe that we slight any particular portion of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.480" offset="3549832">The full decision of Judge Lemley as well as the full decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals is in the pleadings that have already been filed heretofore before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.761" offset="3603017">Now in the light of the Solicitor General's remarks, let's look at some of the things that judge Lemley said in his decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.431" offset="3641678">As has been said, there can be no question that the board made a prompt and reasonable start toward compliance with the principles laid down in the Brown cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.737" offset="3690893">Thereafter, it put its plan into operation and has adhered to it in good faith in the face of great difficulties.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.533" offset="3722031">Now it has come here seeking relief only after it has been confronted with what is from an educational standpoint an intolerable situation and it does not ask for an abandonment of its plan nor does it attempt to obtain indefinite postponement.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.307" offset="3789218">It is simply requesting a practical delay and we are convinced that in seeking this delay the board is still acting in good faith, and upon the showing that has been made, we are satisfied that the board needs more time to carry out its plan in an effective manner, that to grant the instant petition is in the public interest and is consistent with good faith compliance at the earliest practicable day with the principles above mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.034" offset="3916069">In reaching this conclusion, we are not unmindful of the admonition of the Supreme Court that the vitality of those principles cannot be allowed to yield simply because of disagreement with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.419" offset="3965597">Here, however, as pointed out by the board in its final brief, the opposition to integration in Little Rock is more than a mere mental attitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.377" offset="4005407">It has manifested itself in overt acts which have actually damaged educational standards and which will continue to do so if relief is not granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.103" offset="4056398">We have seen that the Supreme Court said in the second Brown decision that the transition from a formerly segregated school to a school free from compulsory segregation should be carried out in an effective manner and that such a transition is in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.818" offset="4139259">In our estimation a transition which impairs or disrupts educational programs and standards and which will continue to do so is not in the public interest, but on the other hand inflicts irreparable harm upon all of the students concerned regardless of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.285" offset="4225045">Whereas here such a transition is being undertaken under the compulsive effects of a Federal Court order, a refusal to modify such an order so as to ameliorate the situation would in our opinion under the circumstances here present be inequitable if not arbitrary as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="1123.206" offset="4492748">That is the primary problem that this school board has in carrying out its plan of integration or its plan of desegregation which I think is more accurate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2321.927" offset="9287680">Now we agree with that and we feel that the first exercise of judgment should be on the school board itself and then it should be under the supervision of the District Court to determine whether the school board acted in good faith and used good judgment, and if not then based on the evidence he could say so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.713" offset="9382766">And Judge Lemley, using that judicial discretion, directed to him by this Court, did so and found that the school board was justified in asking for that delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.774" offset="9447027">The point I am making is simply this that the school board admitted from the very beginning that it was -- it could not foretell the future well enough to say that any exact period of time was necessary to solve the problem, but judgments had to be made and used and it used its judgment in suggesting to Judge Lemley this period of time which he apparently felt was necessary to carry out or have any possibility of a solution of these problems.</text>

            <text syncTime="3305.148" offset="13220571">Well that then brings me to this question since as I understand your answers and your colloquy particularly with Mr. Justice Harlan and Mr. Justice Frankfurter, that in large part the situation which prompted your petition to the District Court was a situation brought on by the active or by actions, affirmative actions of state legislature and its governor, I think, I think your brief also suggest something, actions on the part of your state judiciary, not on the side of enforcement of the constitution but opposed indeed in every way that the state can try to that enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.770" offset="13451076">Just how was this Court in a position to allow, or sanction, or approve a delay sought on the ground that the responsible state officials rather than be on the side of enforcement of these constitutional rights, have taken actions to frustrate their enforcement?</text>

            <text syncTime="3392.268" offset="13569045">Well Mr. Justice Brennan I have that later on in my argument, but since you have brought it up now, let's see if we can dispose of it which in effect I was going to conclude with, but in view of your question I think we might as well answer it right now and that's simply this as we see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.695" offset="13666743">We have described here a situation where the school board which is a creature of the state, it's an arm of the state government, is placed between the millstones as Justice Sanborn of the Eighth Circuit said “between the upper and the nether millstone,” in a conflict between the state and federal government and the – and all of the agencies of each.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.601" offset="13778338">And it seems to us that we have pointed out the absurdity of the premise that a school district should keep the peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.563" offset="13810207">Now I have something to say about that when I get back on the principle argument, but here is what we are suggesting and which will be borne out by the balance of our argument, that the problem is not yet been grasped by Attorney General's office or the Solicitor General, and by the Eighth Circuit of appeals in a situation of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.811" offset="13919190">And we think that a plan of desegregation which has the planning along with it for the support of that plan in an effective manner is something that can be done by the agencies which are setup for those purposes by the federal and state the governments but certainly not by there school board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.213" offset="14036846">Now some plan it seems to us adequate enforcement must come forward if you are going to have a conflict that runs head-on so to speak between your federal and your state governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.160" offset="14108630">Now, at that point, that is again the reason that we are asking for additional time for those conflicts which are completely beyond the realm of this school board to solve and be given an opportunity to be solved by the two sovereignties involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="3658.606" offset="14634423">Now, there have been many instances I believe both in the federal government and in that state, where a certain Court decisions have prompted the legislative bodies of the national government or the state government to pass laws which would circumvent that particular court decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3679.651" offset="14718537">At least that has happened in our state many times, where the court did not express the will of the people as determined by the legislative body and I think that probably history will bear that out insofar as the National Congress is concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="5172.896" offset="20691487">And they suggested that the District Court considered all of the evidence and then determine, in his best judgment, when he felt that such a climate of acceptance might be foretold.</text>
            <text syncTime="5188.116" offset="20752405">And Judge Lemley declined to assume that first responsibility, and in his statement to all of the parties, told the school board to go back and exercise its judgment, which he felt should be exercised as to what period of time was necessary within which to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5211.633" offset="20846446">And that's when the school board considering the time required for various state statues and other things to get out of the way and to provide some reasonable period to let things simmer down, concluded that two-and-a-half years was the proper time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5230.096" offset="20920320">Now the first consideration, that they came to or first conclusion was that it might work better and I believe we touched on that point at the last hearing, that it had a chance of working better at mid semester, that the school was better organized at that time and school officials were you might say in more complete charge of the situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="5732.037" offset="22928091">Mr. Wayne Upton received the letter from the Attorney General I believe on September the 9th and answered it the same day, and sent me a copy of it in which he says, “Dear Mr. Rogers, this will acknowledge your receipt on September 9 of your airmail letter of September 7th relating to the problem of the Little Rock School Board in the event that immediate integration at Central High School is ordered by the Supreme Court of United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5760.797" offset="23043135">We are indeed grateful for the attitude of your office as expressed in your September 7 letter and you maybe assured that the school board will give this matter its careful consideration at the earliest practicable moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5773.710" offset="23094753">I cannot speak for the board being only one of six members, but the thinking of board during the school year of 1957-58 was that criminal prosecutions would have been more helpful in solving the board's problems than injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5789.901" offset="23159536">Since ours is a considerably larger community than either Hoxie or Clinton it occurred to us that in an injunctive order directed to specific individuals would not necessarily have been affective.</text>
            <text syncTime="5802.191" offset="23208751">There were so many people in this community actively opposed to integration that we had – that had we obtained orders of injunction against the known leaders, others would have been there to take their places.</text>
            <text syncTime="5814.454" offset="23257757">It seems to us that we could have very well been involved in an almost endless effort to obtain injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5824.167" offset="23296627">Moreover for a great portion of the time there was no federal judge available and such by the way is the situation at the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5832.067" offset="23328183">Nevertheless our board shares with you the interest and desire to arrive at a peaceable solution of the problems facing us.</text>
            <text syncTime="5839.845" offset="23359321">We will at all times be available for consultation with you or other officers of the Department of Justice.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5845.928" offset="23383667">Now you have asked for my observation about that and in all candor I will tell is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5855.466" offset="23421806">We feel that the offer from the Attorney General comes at least a year late.</text>
            <text syncTime="5861.491" offset="23445943">Our second observation is what Mr. Upton pointed out that the school board should not be put in the position of seeking injunctions against people when it was not the motivating force which caused the United States Supreme Court to make these decisions in the Brown cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5888.832" offset="23555239">In other words it was willing to comply with the law and it did what it could within its limited power to do that, but it has been the feeling of that board that if injunctive relief is the answer, which it questioned, then such injunctive relief should come through the cooperation of the NAACP which is adequately financed and certainly ably styled and the Attorney General's office and not from injunctive relief at the institution of the school board itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="5928.350" offset="23713332">Now that is partially my observation but I think it pretty generally expresses the basic feeling of this board.</text>

            <text syncTime="6595.349" offset="26381375">In your argument before as I recall it, you stated that one of the forceful arguments that was made before us, that there were statute passed by various states that were intended to nullify, you may not of used the word nullify, to nullify this Court's order and people were not sure it would remain the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="6634.265" offset="26536960">Well the first part of that certainly is accurate and I think it's implicit in us being here that we feel that this is a problem which this Court must deal with and again I say though that the conclusion of our school board and of our local district judge was that of that the problems in Little Rock Arkansas as distinguished from other related problems or dissimilar problems in other states, that a time for a cooling off period was in order and it was the only hope of arriving at suitable solutions that would be acceptable both to courts and to the majority of the people in that area and in areas similarly situated with similar problems.</text>

            <text syncTime="6694.199" offset="26776764">Mr. Butler, your answer to Justice Black a minute ago to the question preceding which you've just answered, your answer is if I may say so is about as important thing as has been said by you in the course of your argument, and therefore I would like to ask you whether I rightly infer the full significance of what you said.</text>
            <text syncTime="6716.393" offset="26865476">Am I right to infer that you suggest that the mass of people in Arkansas, are law abiding, are not mobsters, they do not like desegregation, but they maybe one, two respect for the Constitution is pronounced by the organ charged with the duty of declaring it and therefore adjusting themselves to it, although they may not like it, is that the significance to what you said?</text>

            <text syncTime="6816.456" offset="27265776">Some man comes up with a gun in your back, and he orders you to do something that maybe you ought to do, but as long as he has that gun in your back, he's going to try to find someway to turn around quickly and take that gun away and is going to amount in the long run to a particular conflict between those two people.</text>
            <text syncTime="6836.513" offset="27346024">Whereas if you remove the gun and tempers have a chance to simmer down, the man at whose back the gun is being pointed may see the advisability of following the course which the man behind him had advocated all along, but in a spirit of conciliation, in a spirit of patriotism if you please, he will come nearer doing the thing without injury to either party, if he is given time within which to appraise it in a judicial manner, and in a slow manner, in a manner with deliberate speed if you please Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
