            <text syncTime="25.610" offset="102400">The facts of the case are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.708" offset="110759">On April 30, 1956, federal agents in the Northern District of Georgia received a tip from an informant that petitioner had installed a distillery in his farmhouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.685" offset="170736">He had -- he had previously had experience along that line and so the agents proceeded to his farmhouse, to the vicinity thereof to investigate the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.242" offset="216921">They found spent mash running from a rubber hose into a small river, in a hollow behind the farmhouse and traces to within approximately 50 yards of the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.710" offset="274808">The following day, which is May 1st, 1956, they again returned to the vicinity.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.670" offset="306678">They found at that time, spent mash was once again running into the stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.728" offset="326844">They could smell the odor of cooking mash in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.419" offset="341577">They could hear the sound of a blower burner in operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.649" offset="358504">Here, I might say that a blower burner is used to transmit fuel oil to the boiler, which generates steam and steam is then in turn used in distillation process.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.592" offset="406361">They also heard voices and bumping noises and continued their surveillance at that time until about 2:00 a.m.on the morning of May 2nd.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.268" offset="453068">So, as of that time, the agents knew that a distillery was in operation within the farmhouse and they knew that several persons were involved, because for -- from time to time they could see people moving around the premises.</text>

            <text syncTime="168.368" offset="673437">I -- I'd like to say on page 40 of the record, State Agent Hollingsworth is testifying and he testified, it took 30 to 45 minutes to drive out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.049" offset="712098">Later on that day of May 2nd, in the afternoon, the agents procured a daytime search warrant and proceeded in a party of five again to the vicinity of the farmhouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.909" offset="759536">They arrived there in about an hour before darkness.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.462" offset="773747">It was a gray overcast the day.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.982" offset="783882">They took up a position in a small grove across the road from petitioner's farmhouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.447" offset="809691">And the agent in charge, elect in charge -- elected to continue his investigation rather than serve the warrant at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.065" offset="844173">He testified that he did this for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.977" offset="855876">Number one, he wanted to learn whether any other persons were implicated in the operation of this distillery.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.453" offset="881789">He wanted to learn who they were and he also wanted to learn whether there were any vehicles involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.259" offset="908957">It began to rain heavily and the rain slackened off then at about 7:00 p.m. or thereabout.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.347" offset="941349">The agents heard voices from the farmhouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.766" offset="959007">The voices inquired whether someone would like to bring up the truck at that time and an unidentified person left the premises and went down to the home of petitioner's father, which is about a quarter of a mile down the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.881" offset="1011461">Thereafter, a truck was driven into the farmyard and driven around behind the farmhouse, out of sight of the agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.334" offset="1045316">Then, the agents saw people moving around in the house through a window, a lighted window.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.932" offset="1067677">They heard heavy bumping noises, as though heavy objects were being moved.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.908" offset="1091605">And -- and about 9:00 or 9:15 p.m., the truck motor was started and the truck began to drive around from the corner of the farmhouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.183" offset="1132669">The agents then began to move across the road and as the truck arrived at the driveway to the farmhouse it became mired.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.197" offset="1160777">At that point, the agents overtook the truck and they arrested two persons who are on the truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.313" offset="1185228">Number one, James McKinney, who's driving the truck and Grady Jones, the brother of petitioner, was on the back.</text>

            <text syncTime="2301.349" offset="9205342">On page 51 of the record, this testimony appears in here a question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.335" offset="9229270">“What was the reason, please sir, that you told Mrs.Jones that you did not need a search warrant or didn't have one?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.264" offset="9249019">Answer “Because I thought we had sufficient evidence to go in the premises without a search warrant.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.556" offset="9266155">Question “You didn't exhibit this search warrant that you had to her?”</text>

            <text syncTime="2320.644" offset="9282560">That was a daytime search warrant.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.930" offset="9291651">And on page 54 of the record, the trial judge found this as a matter of fact, as to the entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.337" offset="9313280">Mrs. Jones asked Officer Woody Langford if he had a search warrant and Langford replied that he did not need one and the officers then searched the premises without a search warrant, with reference to question asked by Mr. Justice Frankfurter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.262" offset="9373048">On the same page, the trial judge found this as a matter of fact with reference to the -- he says the house had only two or three doors and they were five officers watching the residence and would have been possible for the officers to watch each of the doors and still send another officer for a nighttime search warrant had the officers deemed this to be necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.879" offset="9443474">At the bottom of the page, in the trial judge's findings of fact, he says, "The Court finds that probable cause for the search existed at the time the search was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.085" offset="9476284">There was no finding that there was any question of going in there for the purpose of making an arrest," as contended by the Government in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.309" offset="9505228">Now, this, if the Court please, we say that this case is on all fours with the Kaplan case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.465" offset="9533858">It was decided by Judge Learned Hand in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.387" offset="9553502">On page -- page 5 of our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.674" offset="9574609">In that case, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals with reference to a warrant of arrest and this case was -- certiorari was denied by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.286" offset="9609091">The Court said this, “The statute certainly requires a warrant when there is time to obtain one that this concession is limited to occasions when it is not safe to wait,” and they were speaking of arrest warrants in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.842" offset="9655275">Now, we respectfully submit that in this case, the record shows that there was no question, but what they did have was an ample amount of time to have obtained some warrant of some kind, either to search or to arrest.</text>
