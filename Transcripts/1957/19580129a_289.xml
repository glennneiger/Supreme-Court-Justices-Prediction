            <text syncTime="148.177" offset="592666">And you can't fit all of these cases into a nice logical pattern because each one of them involves some kind of an accommodation of conflicting interest and the -- the result that you reach in one case may not square logically with the result in some other case, because I think it's in the nature of the problem.</text>

            <label>Mr. Dominick L. Manoli</label>
            <text syncTime="326.395" offset="1305496">I think that's the upshot of the Board decision in NuTone, coupled with the Board's decision in Livingston Shirt on which this Court -- on which the Board in this case relied.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.389" offset="1345515">In Livingston Shirt, if I may explain, there, the employer had addressed his -- the employees on company time and a union asked for an equivalent opportunity to address the employees on company time.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.148" offset="1392536">The Board not only stressed the protected character of the employer's speech that would -- wasn't of course, it carried out time.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.025" offset="1424091">But it also stressed the fact, the union had available other places for reaching the employees for this purpose than the employer's property.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.766" offset="1458991">And as I say in this NuTone -- in the NuTone case, the first case we've got you arguing, the Board does rely upon that, the fact that it is the employer's property and it also relies upon the availability of other ways of distributing literature.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.380" offset="1517505">It -- well, let me say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.339" offset="1521267">It relies upon the Livingston Shirt, which I think permits us to make the full blown argument that the availability of other avenues for the distribution of literature away from the company's plant is an additional factor which the Board may take into consideration and say concluding, that the employer's use of his own property doesn't require him to give a similar opportunity to his own employs to distribute literature within the plant.</text>

            <text syncTime="469.767" offset="1879040">The rule is that the employees -- that the employer may forbid the employees from engaging in oral solicitation during working time.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.216" offset="1912790">Now, the question in this case is whether such a rule becomes invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.259" offset="1932957">And therefore, an improper basis for the discharge of employees who engaged in such solicitation during working time if the employer himself engages in coercive, or anti-union solicitation during working time.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.199" offset="1992725">Let me give the facts that give rise to this, for this issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.216" offset="2012787">Here, in sometime in 1954, the Textile Workers union sought to organize the company's employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.566" offset="2050194">Shortly thereafter, the company summoned a number of employees who were suspected of having solicited other fellow employees to join the union during working time and they were warned.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.504" offset="2101917">They were warned that it was against the company's rules for them to engage in union solicitation during company time, during working time.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.153" offset="2136607">And that in the infraction of the rule would result in their dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.592" offset="2154266">Contemporaneously with this warning, the company also added a further warning, that if the union succeeded in organizing the plant, the plant would close down.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.862" offset="2195435">Shortly thereafter, a number of the company's supervisory personnel engaged in what I think maybe fairly characterized as a widespread campaign against the union during working time.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.971" offset="2247784">During working time, these supervisory people approached various employees at their work.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.499" offset="2277982">They interrogated them concerning their union membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.588" offset="2290312">They solicit them to withdraw from the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.338" offset="2301283">They warned them that unionization of the plant would result in closing of the plant, and further warned them that they would lose their jobs and other benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.222" offset="2336810">While this was going on, the company discharged two employees, allegedly for violating the rule against solicitation during working time.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.305" offset="2373172">And the record shows in fact that these employees had solicited fellow workers to join the union during working time.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.141" offset="2404519">And the one -- one man was discharged because he had solicited the elevator operator as they were going up and down the elevator, the operator of the elevator, and the other one -- the other one have solicited a fellow employee to join the union, who the fellow employee was at work, but the man who was doing the soliciting, a man who was discharged was off work at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.907" offset="2495530">So I say the company discharged these two men allegedly for violating its rule against solicitation during working time.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.759" offset="2526981">The Board found that the employer had violated the statute by his coercive statements and conduct namely, the interrogation of employees concerning memberships, soliciting them to withdraw, the threats of economic reprisals if the union succeeded in organizing -- in organizing the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.634" offset="2602527">With respect to the two employees who were discharged, the Board found that their discharge was discriminatory within the meaning of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.362" offset="2641398">That they were discharged, in Board's view, they were discharged not for the violation of a valid no-solicitation rule, but rather, that they were discharged for conduct, otherwise, protected by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.509" offset="2698031">And the basis of that was that the -- in the Board's view, the employer by his own action, by his own coercive anti-human solicitation during working time had in effect invalidated the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.839" offset="2747350">And that therefore, the employer could not invoke the rule against the employers who engaged in similar conduct without violating the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="700.839" offset="2803252">And my point being this if there were unfair labor practices there that amounted to coercion, it fired employees because of union activities and so forth, how is it that you can so easily separate those from the -- from this rule that he had broke himself in that case, and then bind them together so closely in this case?</text>

            <label>Mr. Dominick L. Manoli</label>
            <text syncTime="725.388" offset="2901473">Well, I think that largely depends I suppose upon how these issues have sort of come up the ladder to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.584" offset="2930312">I think it is an independent matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.122" offset="2940447">The Board might have said in the other case, that in view of the employer's other unfair labor practices, we conclude that his invocation of the rule -- again, in the prohibition against the employees was of a discriminatory character.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.545" offset="3002096">Conceivably might have said that, of course, we would have been faced with problems of what Section 8 (c) does to that since the employer's speeches were not of a coercive character.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.628" offset="3046504">But that is not the way the issue has come up as I say.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.779" offset="3059043">The issue in -- in that other case has finally boiled down to this very narrow one of whether standing alone without regard to the surrounding circumstances, the employer's naked prohibition against the employees' distributing literature within the plant is bad when he himself distributes literature within the plant himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.115" offset="3132395">Here, the case has not come up that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.058" offset="3148173">What we have here is unfair labor practice and the validity or invalidity of the rule must be determined as against those unfair labor practice as I hope to show in just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.803" offset="3199164">Now, continuing with the Board's order in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.224" offset="3208882">The Board required the employer to refrain from engaging the unfair labor practice which it found.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.370" offset="3233437">It required the employer to reinstate these two employees and file it.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.415" offset="3253603">It required the employer to cease enforcing the rule against solicitation and the discriminatory action that the Board found had been enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.445" offset="3285682">The court below approved the Board's findings that the employer by his statements to these various employees during working time had engaged in conduct prohibited by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.133" offset="3344509">The court below, however, rejected the Board's findings that the discharge of the two employees for allegedly for violating the rule against solicitation was discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.127" offset="3392470">In the Court's view, there was no basis in the record so except for concluding that the rule had against solicitation during working time by the employees had been invalidated by any action of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.267" offset="3461016">And this purpose was bottomed upon the subsidiary premise that there was no evidence in the record which indicated the employer had ever permitted any solicitation of any kind in violation of the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.296" offset="3517127">Now, initially we think that the Court has misconceived -- has misconceived the nature, the legal significance of the action of the -- of the supervisory employees approaching these various employees during working time and asking them in effect to abandon the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.590" offset="3598315">As I have indicated, there was a widespread effort on the part of supervisory personnel to persuade the employees not to join -- or to leave the union and not to join it.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.473" offset="3641887">But it's more than persuasion, it was of a coercive character.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.943" offset="3655680">The Court of -- and the court below of course agreed in accepting these findings, agreed that this was in violation of the statute and that it was of a coercive character.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.528" offset="3686087">And of course, Section 8 (c) plays no part.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.983" offset="3695909">But we think, and this is in -- this is important to our case, we think that what the Court had -- has failed to perceive that the action of the supervisory personnel in going to these various employees during the working time constitutes solicitation, just as much in violation of the company's rules as to the action of the employees who were discharged when they were soliciting for the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.655" offset="3798518">Now, with that premise -- with that premise, I think we come into the heart of this case namely, whether employer's enforcement of a rule of this solicitation, by the employees during working time, becomes discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.673" offset="3878661">When he enforces that -- it would become discriminatory when he himself violates the rule in a manner that's not protected by Section 8 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="979.576" offset="3918263">The Board as I say, answered this question in the affirmative.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.995" offset="3935922">And the court below disagreed for the reasons that I've indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.290" offset="3949087">And I do say that I think that the court below if I may use the expression went off the track because of its initial misconception, its initial misconception of what the supervisory employees were doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.498" offset="3993913">If they were violating the Act, that is the rule against solicitation, just as much as the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.122" offset="4016483">Now, as I indicated in the other case, the basis, the accommodation which has been worked out under the statue with respect to oral solicitations is that the employer may permit the employees from engaging in oral solicitations during working time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.903" offset="4083566">And the basis of that rule is, that the employers' interest in the efficient running of this plant and plant discipline, compels that the employee's interest in the effective communication of their ideas concerning unionization, that the employer's interest should be paramount, it should be paramount to that -- to the employees interest in communicating among themselves with respect to union matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.912" offset="4191608">Now, we believe, we believe that once the employer himself has engaged in coercive anti-union solicitation to -- during the working time, he has destroyed the basis of the accommodation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.614" offset="4258377">Now, I know the question is, “How do we distinguish this case from the other case?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.074" offset="4272274">The distinction is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.390" offset="4277499">That the -- that the accommodation in the other case rests on a much broader basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.991" offset="4291918">It rests upon the basis as we see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.164" offset="4300591">Not only the -- of the -- on the basis of the employer's interest in preventing his plant from being littered but also the further consideration that there are other avenues of communication available to the employees for the distribution of literature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.161" offset="4348552">But here, the accommodation which has been worked --- which is been worked out under the statute with respect to oral solicitation rest upon the consideration of the employer's interest in the efficient running of his plant requires the employees not to be permitted to engage in such solicitation during working time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.204" offset="4412813">But we said, that once the employer engages in that kind of conduct, he didn't think -- as a matter of law we think manifest that he is no -- when he enforces the rule against the employees, that he is no longer prompted by considerations of efficiency, but rather, that the dismissal of those employees rest not upon the violation of a valid plant rule, but rather upon activity which is otherwise protected by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.691" offset="4522736">And in that respect, we think that this case in that posture, this case is not unlike the Republic Aviation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.029" offset="4552098">In the Republic Aviation case, the employer had prohibited the employees from engaging in union solicitation during non-working time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.328" offset="4585221">Of course, there is that difference between that case and this case, during non-working time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.976" offset="4603820">But the Court and one or two employees I believe were discharged for having solicited during non-working time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.625" offset="4630465">The Court said that rule was too broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.684" offset="4638720">It was invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.184" offset="4644676">And therefore, even though the employer may not have been prompted by any anti-union advice nevertheless, when he discharged those employees on the basis of an invalid rule by respect to solicitation, the discharge, necessarily as a matter of law rested upon -- was based upon the employee's exercise of rights protected by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.490" offset="4733910">So here, we say that the employer's conduct with anti-union solicitation during the working time, if that invalidated the rule, and the rule being invalid to discharge if these employees rest not upon the violation of a valid plant rule, but rather upon activity otherwise protected by the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1213.267" offset="4853029">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.980" offset="4863896">I think in the statement of counsel and our own version of the facts arises what we contend as actually the issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.687" offset="4910707">This is substantial disputed fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.166" offset="4920633">There was a substantial dispute of fact between the parties, between the Board, and its trial examiner, and by the court below in its evaluation of the Board's findings of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.435" offset="4965669">That dispute permeates this matter and brings the matter here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.644" offset="4990537">Unlike the no-solicitation rule, I mean, the no distribution rule, we think insofar as these matters have been consistent in their holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.804" offset="5039125">The rule on the solicitation has been relatively consistent for a long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.398" offset="5061590">The rules on solicitation arise out of the Peyton Packing case, which was affirmed by this same Court from which this certiorari was taken and was approved by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.593" offset="5110282">The Peyton Packing case in the last analysis adopts the premise that working time is for work and that quoting exactly with -- from the language as approved by this Court, “It is therefore within the province of an employer to prohibit and enforce, to promulgate and enforce a rule, prohibiting union solicitation during working hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.308" offset="5213205">Such a rule must be presumed valid in the absence of evidence that it was adopted for discriminatory purpose.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.636" offset="5246537">Fundamentally, we get to this situation here, this plant doesn't go the whole way if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.370" offset="5281437">This plant has only one limitation insofar as its employees are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.160" offset="5304633">And that -- and that limitation is that they may not engage in solicitation during the time that they are actually supposed to be at work, or of people who actually is supposed to be at work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.361" offset="5353430">That means that they solicit, they can talk about the union, they can talk about anything else, during all of the time they're in the plant except those times when the nature of their job and their duties require their attention to their job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.823" offset="5411213">Now, the evidence in this record although the Board disregarded it, the court below recognized it, was that this room was a rule of some many years standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.358" offset="5449352">And that it had been invoked and applied in matters other than union solicitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.070" offset="5472235">It was undisputed evidence that a man was reprimanded for soliciting a series of signatures on a petition to get his son parole from imprisonment long before this union question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.465" offset="5521763">And he was warned then that it was against the rules to solicit during working hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.481" offset="5545900">Now, what happened in very simple short statement was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.987" offset="5571918">This union began a very active campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.059" offset="5592189">It gave out and early in November of 1954, some 600 cards according to the evidence to get signed up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.621" offset="5626462">It became apparent to the supervisors that the soliciting of signatures on these cards were interfering with production.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.946" offset="5663765">There was testimony about men being grouped up in the hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.570" offset="5674214">There was testimony about people leaving their jobs and going to other departments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.042" offset="5696157">And the respondent in keeping with the rule of 60 years standing and a practice of 60 years standing, made the employees aware of the rule in exactly the same way it made them -- made them aware of the other rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.760" offset="5746939">It notified the people, various people, that the rule is that you may not solicit during working hours, and you may not solicit other people who are working.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.588" offset="5794273">And we are putting you on notice that if in the future you violate that rule, you would be subject to discipline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.195" offset="5824679">In the case of the two men that are ultimately before this Court, one man on the evening before engaged in solicitation that involved his leaving his own work, in an operating machine that he had to cut off to leave according to the testimony, and going across the room to another employee, several times during the course of the evening, where that employee was at work, and soliciting him to sign a union card.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.451" offset="5929796">The testimony was incidentally that that employee finally signed it, so he leave him alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.248" offset="5952888">This was reported to his supervisor.When he came in to work early the next shift, the supervisor called him in and called his attention to the rule, and told him that future conduct of this sort would subject him to disciplinary discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.400" offset="6013597">The evidence shows that during that very same shift, he then solicited another employee, first, while the employee -- while the man discharged himself was at work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.250" offset="6060931">And then, after he have gotten off from work and the man that succeeded him had come to work, and was working, to again sign -- to sign a union card, and he was discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.967" offset="6103771">In the other case, although counsel belittles the -- the facts in terms of soliciting a man while riding on the elevator, if the Court please, that was not the fact at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.075" offset="6148284">It was a man who had been reported by one supervisor as leaving his department to go into another department to solicit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.988" offset="6183915">As a result of that report, he was called in and cautioned about this rule and warned that future violation would lead to his discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.377" offset="6213486">Within the same week, this employee went again into this department, and stopped the man who operates an elevator which isn't a passenger elevator at all, it's a freight moving vehicle, at a place where neither he had any business being and where the employee should not have stopped, to sign a union card and to help him solicit other people in this employee's department, to join the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.221" offset="6324872">This was observed again by the supervisor and reported and he was discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.537" offset="6346083">In the second case, the man in his own testimony admitted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.102" offset="6360398">In the first case, there was some denial but there was a credibility finding.Incidentally, that was not accepted to that the denial was not believed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.851" offset="6399373">Now, in those cases if the Court please, independently of the no-solicitation rule, an employer has a right, we submit, to say to an employee when you are supposed to be at work, stay on your job, don't engage in extraneous activity during that period whether it's union or any other union or -- or non-union, or any other activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.131" offset="6488503">And if an employee disregards that instruction, under the Act itself, under the decisions of this Court, an employer has a right to discharge for that independently of this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.872" offset="6539389">Getting further into this matter, into the question of solicitation if you please, if the Court please, the fundamental here, the basic reason for the existence of an industrial establishment is the work time, it's work time of the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.733" offset="6610860">And that is the only thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.504" offset="6617966">And that is the only time that this respondent has restricted solicitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.624" offset="6642416">Now, counsel argues that the Board found that the respondent engaged in solicitation in work time itself and that that was discriminatory and violative of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.503" offset="6705946">In the first place, if the Court please, that isn't what the Board found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.099" offset="6724336">The Board found that because in each version, the employer didn't invoke his rule until after the union began soliciting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.200" offset="6764774">And two, because the employer didn't invoke its rule by posting a notice on the bulletin board, or some other method that the Board approved of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.012" offset="6799987">And three, because the employer permitted talking of any kind during non-work time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.288" offset="6825064">And four, because the employer didn't show the extent to which this solicitation interfered with production, that the respondent invoked its rule, not for a business purpose, but for a purpose of stopping or interfering with organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.700" offset="6902700">The trial examiner found to the contrary and the court below in the evaluation of the evidence, found that the boards inferences which were contrary to the evidence were not supported by substantial evidence in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.234" offset="6956931">And the Court found one that there was no validity to the finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.789" offset="6975112">That this respondent invoked its rule for the purpose of interfering with the employees' rights under the Act rather than for a legitimate business purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="1840.680" offset="7362664">You see, the trial -- there were three discharges in this case originally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.831" offset="7379278">The trial examiner held all three of them were valid.</text>

            <text syncTime="1850.768" offset="7402998">The Court held that one was -- was illegal and two were valid under the circumstances before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.922" offset="7435598">The other factor in this case which we think is extremely significant if the Court please, is the fact that insofar as the so-called 8 (a) (1) violation is of concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.529" offset="7494113">The testimony in the record and incidentally respondent did not accept and do not resist enforcement in the court below of the findings of 8 (a) (1) except insofar as it related to the discharges in the no-solicitation rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.314" offset="7549179">But the court below recognized as the trial examiner recognized that there must be some reasonable relationship between this alleged coercive and acts in violation of 8 (a) (1) and the so-called no-solicitation doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.009" offset="7643951">There were several cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.626" offset="7650429">There are not too many of these instances that involve half a dozen supervisors conceivably with over 5000 employees involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.292" offset="7681149">There were several instances of interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.301" offset="7693166">Incidentally as the Chief Justice pointed out by his question, it was exactly the same sort of interrogation that was involved in the NuTone case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.206" offset="7728797">There were several instances of conversation, in which in supervisors expressed opinions which taken in context were construed to be threats, threats that conceivably the plant might close.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.523" offset="7790028">There were one or two instances of very, very close statements where the trial examiner in effect said that taken as stated, it was not a violation of the Act but in -- the employee could've construed it to be a threat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.574" offset="7862230">Now, insofar as the two employees here are concerned, the two dischargees, there was no-solicitation of them to do anything except to stay on the jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.503" offset="7913953">And that they refused to do and they were disciplined for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.979" offset="7927850">And there was no dispute about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.139" offset="7936522">But if an employee must establish as the Board contends here, one, not only that there is some business purpose in it's restricting work time to work, but also must establish the extent in a manner satisfactory to the Board that these activities interfere with work and must promulgate the rule in accordance with some set formula that the Board favors and must thereafter be restricted from interfering with virtually a carte blanche authority of employees to walk off their jobs when they please, to engage in other activities, simply because some supervisor has gone over the line in some point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.984" offset="8131918">Then, it seems to me that the Board has undertaken not to administer the act but to set a whole philosophy of industrial operations of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.059" offset="8172147">Now, if the Court please, in the Board's orders enforced by the Court, there are specific findings that the employer shall not do this, that or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.629" offset="8210495">That he shall take certain affirmative actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.154" offset="8220526">And if he fails or if he violates him again, he is obviously subject to contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.532" offset="8242051">Now, those unfair labor practices as found by the Board and as supported by substantial evidence, or by virtue of the decree of the court below rectified, he is prohibited, he is required to make the necessary posting that he will cease and desist from this conduct and he is prohibited from engaging in it in the future, including, if the Court please, a prohibition against the supervisors soliciting employees to withdraw from the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.897" offset="8375484">There was one incident.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.130" offset="8380500">An incident that the record shows he was not doing work outs of a conversation between a supervisor and an employee in which he said to the employee in substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.105" offset="8416340">Don't you think you ought to get your card back?</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.809" offset="8423236">Or, don't you want your card bank?</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.972" offset="8435879">The Board within its province of interpretation has held that any solicitation of withdrawal from a union is a violation to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.601" offset="8474331">Whether I accept that premise or not, the respondent did not accept to it insofar as a petition for enforcement is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.745" offset="8502962">And these orders enforced by the Court prohibits the employer and his supervisors from soliciting withdrawals from the union.</text>

            <text syncTime="2211.668" offset="8846629">But in this instance, the evidence show that a man or personnel clerk had been sent by the supervisor to Jones to ask him to refrain from the union activities.</text>

            <text syncTime="2432.445" offset="9729776">But not insofar as any of the other facets of the case were concerned because every -- every factor that exist in Avondale existed in NuTone, except that the ultimate issue that the Board has drawn on appeal is one in the application of the no-distribution rule which is certainly a less attribute to production than the no-work time rule which is a major attribute to production.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.899" offset="9823504">And they come up with entirely diametrically opposed propositions on the major and the minor purpose of this thing, with the factual background virtually identical for all practical purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.220" offset="9876793">So they couldn't be a new rule evolved in Avondale unless the Board has evolved the rule that applies to Avondale, period.</text>

            <text syncTime="2485.291" offset="9941159">We -- we make one further point if the Court please, and that is even if we get into the premise that the Board argues with the validity of NuTone, obviously, the full gambit of accommodation is accomplished when employees are only restricted from utilizing the employer's premises doing the one circumstance that it is at the time that they're suppose to be giving their attention to their jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.261" offset="10068950">They can solicit, they can talk, they can literally distribute literature during lunch hours, during smoking periods, in the restrooms, before shift, after shift, in the plant property.</text>

            <text syncTime="2549.293" offset="10197159">Without going into it, it's perfectly obvious that a supervisor even though he may ultimately step over the line of legality, inherently would be in a better position to determine from an employer standpoint when production might be interrupted without loss, that an employee who simply takes literally a French leave whenever he -- the notion strikes it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.460" offset="10297783">And that, we submit is also inherent in this distinction that the Board seeks to draw.</text>

            <text syncTime="2905.872" offset="11623445">And therefore, he cannot invoke the rule against the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.761" offset="11639014">Here, our position was that the employer has destroyed the basis of his rule by forbidding employees from engaging in oral solicitation during working time, but his own entire union coercive solicitation during working time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.985" offset="11707873">Now, if it's a two-way street in the other case as the Court of Appeals thought in NuTone, it's also has to be a two-way street in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.691" offset="11742668">Now, however though, of course our position is that we can reverse the Court of Appeals' decision in NuTone and also reverse the Court of Appeals' decision in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2968.314" offset="11873176">Fundamentally, we -- we read the Board's decision to hold that where an employer engages in this kind of coercive anti-union solicitation during working time, that he thereby as a matter of law invalidates the rule with respect to the employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="3039.574" offset="12158224">This case I think is more like the Warren case which came up from the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.475" offset="12181838">In that case, the Court will recall the problem was whether or not an employer had refused to bargain with the union after the Court of Appeals had enforced the Board's order -- required, whether the employer was in contempt with the Court's decree which enforced the Board's bargaining order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.987" offset="12251847">In that case, the Court said, “Well, if we looked at the -- the Court of Appeals said, “We've looked at the record and we find that there is no basis, no basis for holding that the union -- that the company as a matter of fact has -- has failed to bargain.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.195" offset="12304718">Now, this Court in disposing of that problem said these words, now I think they apply here, that if we had so understood the record, certiorari would not have been granted, but we do, sir, not so understand, it would belittle the facts over the contrary in each instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.423" offset="12365636">Now, in this case here, the Court of Appeals here has failed to give a -- has failed to appreciate the legal significance of a non-disputed fact namely that the employer engaged in anti-union -- in anti-union solicitation, a form of solicitation just as much in violation of the rule as what the employees were doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.491" offset="12461871">So, in short, we don't think that this case presents a factual issue, but on the contrary, with very important legal questions.</text>
