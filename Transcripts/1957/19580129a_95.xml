            <label>Mr. Judson Harwood</label>
            <text syncTime="80.919" offset="323605">If it please the Court, this is a case for the recovery of corporate income taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.835" offset="347324">The petitioner here is a motor carrier of freight and it holds a license from the Interstate Commerce Commission and operates pursuant to certificates issued by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.986" offset="399882">In the industry, it's referred to as a draft freight or general commodity carrier, that is that it carries in -- in all commodities tendered to it by the public with a few exceptions such as articles and book and things of that nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.344" offset="465293">The years involved or for the years 1951, 1952 and 1953, the question here insofar as this case is concerned is strictly a legal question and it was not necessary to bring to this Court or to the Court of Appeals any of the record below except the technical record.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.418" offset="553587">In 1942, the Commission of Internal Revenue promulgated a regulation or an interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.081" offset="580232">The effect of which was to permit a motor carrier to deduct under Section 23 (a) of the Revenue Act sums that it was required to pay to various States because its vehicles had in some way violated the weight limitation laws of the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.007" offset="659958">That ruling was -- remained in effect until December 1, 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.101" offset="688379">At that time, the Commissioner, and I might say a new or different Commissioner of Internal Revenue, reversed the earlier ruling and held that such sums were not deductible as ordinary and necessary expenses under Section 23 (a) of the -- the Revenue Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.743" offset="762880">As a result of that latter interpretation, the agent of the Bureau of Internal Revenue audited the tax returns for the petitioner, Hoover, for the years 1951, 1952 and 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.201" offset="820767">And insofar as we are here concerned, the only change was that certain sums paid by the petitioner as fines under the various statutes of the various States through which it operated, were disallowed as an operating expense, an additional tax was assessed against petitioner by reason of the disallowance of these items which had been claimed as expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.389" offset="933512">The petitioner paid the additional tax, filed a claim for refund which as you know is a prerequisite to a suit for recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.189" offset="964754">When the claim for refund was denied, a suit for recovery was filed in the District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.343" offset="993280">The case was there tried, evidence was introduced and the Court decided the case adversely to the contentions of petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.163" offset="1024627">And in doing so, it made it unnecessary to transcribe the testimony in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.947" offset="1051690">The petitioner, as a matter of fact, offered substantial evidence that -- to the effect that its violations or the fines resulted not from any willful act on its part or not from any negligent act but in spite of all reasonable care that it could take.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.284" offset="1129117">Now, the court below, in deciding the case, predicated its decision upon the assumption that the petitioner did not act willfully in anyway in overloading any truck nor it was -- did it fail to take all reasonable precautions consistent with a practical operation of its business.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.127" offset="1216470">Did in spite of those -- of that assumption, the District Court held that to allow the deduction would frustrate the enforcement of state -- state weight acts and therefore were not deductible.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.271" offset="1277074">Now, this Court has never expressly held that, if I may refer to it as a frustration theory, was or was not valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.079" offset="1324304">This Court has had two cases in which it is discussed and the first one was referred to as the Heininger case and Judge Learned Hand of the Second Circuit in the Rossman case, construed that case as we contend it should be construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.977" offset="1395879">Later, this Court, in the case of -- in the Lilly case in passing on that question, expressly limited the effect of that decision insofar as the Commissioner here attempting to invoke it.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.105" offset="1476336">I won't read that now but it states in substance that assuming for the purpose of argument that there may be a situation where an expense is ordinary and necessary and still it would not be allowed as a deduction because it would frustrate some sharply defined public power that the facts in the Lilly case did not -- were not in that category.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.651" offset="1566511">Now, it is our position here, one, that the Revenue Act is a revenue producing statute and it is not a policing statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.313" offset="1601202">Congress never intended for the Revenue Act to be used as a supplement to enforce all of the laws of all of the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.170" offset="1636624">Second, even if the frustration theory as -- has been referred to by this Court on two occasions is sound which we deny that even that would not permit or would not forbid the deductions in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.535" offset="1710080">Now, the District Court and the Court of Appeals, which affirmed him in a very short per curiam opinion and adopted the decision of the Court of Appeals, they did not hold that these expenses were not ordinary and necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.232" offset="1772878">They did not -- they based the decision solely on the fact that even if they are ordinary and necessary, and to allow them would frustrate the enforcement of the state statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.528" offset="1818018">Now, it is our position that that is an erroneous legal conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.678" offset="1842678">If a carrier has done what the District Court assumed that it did, that is that it took all reasonable precautions to comply with all of the state weight limitation laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.901" offset="1895549">They could reasonably be expected of it consistent with the practical operation of its business.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.348" offset="1917388">If you take that assumption of fact, then the allowance or disallowance of these fines as an expense is going to have absolutely no bearing on future violations or future compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.719" offset="1966811">If it has no bearing on future violations or future compliance, then it cannot frustrate the enforcement of that act.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.418" offset="1997636">So it is our position that even if this Court should find that ordinary and necessary expenses are not deductible if they would -- if the allowance would tend to frustrate the sharply defined policies or public policies of the State that even in -- that would not preclude the recovery under the factual situation under which we're trying this case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harold_burton" startTime="525.823" stopTime="531.103">
            <label>Justice Harold Burton</label>
            <text syncTime="525.823" offset="2103275">But if they deductible, doesn't that in effect reduce the burden upon the -- the effect stated (Voice Overlap) --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="judson_harwood" startTime="531.103" stopTime="636.573">
            <label>Mr. Judson Harwood</label>
            <text syncTime="531.103" offset="2124382">That is the theory on which some of the lower courts have denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.021" offset="2144026">Now, if the Court please, the case that I think best analyzes the entire situation is the case of Rossman Corporation versus Commissioner 175 F.2d.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.845" offset="2195331">That decision was written by Judge Learned Hand and it did involve a penalty under the OPA statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.665" offset="2230648">Now, I have quoted at length at pages 6, 7 and 8 of our brief the -- that opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.375" offset="2265443">Judge Hand in substance says, “There are penalties and penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.976" offset="2279863">Some are deductible and some are not.”</text>
            <text syncTime="572.429" offset="2289685">That's the way he construes this Court's decision in the Heininger case.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.120" offset="2308389">And he also recognizes the distinction between an unlawful activity which has resulted in an expenditure that was willful or negligent and one that was non-willful or non-negligent.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.276" offset="2369097">He states on the other hand, “Lack of proper care would be relevant to whether the allowance would frustrate the act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="600.896" offset="2403579">Now, the Commissioner in the lower courts and in his brief here has made substantial argument out of the fact that the OPA statute, by its very terms, drew a distinction between a willful violation and a non-willful.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.622" offset="2478393">Well, if the Court please, that is true but the distinction only went to the degree of the punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.960" offset="2503784">If you were willfully violating that act, you paid one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.521" offset="2517995">If you -- if the administrator found that your violation was not willful, you paid another thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.749" offset="2538893">You paid a smaller amount.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harold_burton" startTime="636.573" stopTime="648.420">
            <label>Justice Harold Burton</label>
            <text syncTime="636.573" offset="2546207">But if you'll interpret the acts of Congress as making these deductibles, you can say not only did Congress to that extent reduced the burden on the taxpayer but it assumed it by the Federal Government.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="judson_harwood" startTime="648.420" stopTime="693.899">
            <label>Mr. Judson Harwood</label>
            <text syncTime="648.420" offset="2593646">If the Court please, we don't think so.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.254" offset="2600960">Now, if you analyze it the -- in this case while the transcript is not here, the pleadings and the admission show, this carrier operates some 200 trucks, five or six nights a week.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.320" offset="2649234">The District Court found as a fact in this case, not the assumption that the vast majority of the fines which were imposed upon this carrier, resulted in -- from situations where the vehicle was well within the weight limitation prescribed by the law of the States that imposed the fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.800" offset="2723109">But during the transit, that load in these large tractor-trailers can shift just a few inches one way or the other, and by reason of that shifting, an actual violation had occurred.</text>

            <text syncTime="699.474" offset="2797819">Now, the breakdown of the fines is not in the record because of the way the Court decided the case, of course, it is below.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.089" offset="2824255">The Court found as a fact that the vast majority of them were that category.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.109" offset="2840346">Now, there were -- the others where there was an entire overload on vehicle, the proof showed three category -- three causes.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.991" offset="2871902">The Court mentioned two in its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.397" offset="2881515">They were that this carrier has its authority issued by the Interstate Commerce Commission not only authorizes it but requires it to serve a large segment of population out in the old highway.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.157" offset="2932611">Well, the only way they can pick up freight is to have a truck rundown through a lot of small crossroad communities and pick it up.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.902" offset="2959569">They rely on the weights as shown on the bill of lading until they get to a terminal to weigh it.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.449" offset="2981721">Quite frequently, a shipper will not include in his weight all of the weight of the article.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.687" offset="3002723">Frequently, they do not take into consideration the weight of the container.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.837" offset="3019337">Another cause was that this being a continually changing industry and a growing industry, the power units that are used from time to time changed and the newer units were substantially heavier than the old ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.815" offset="3071164">And there were instances where an older tractor which is a power unit would breakdown on the road and the only other unit available sent after it was a new one which weighed more.</text>

            <text syncTime="783.170" offset="3132604">It's -- it's all involves the weight limitation, either on an actual basis or the whole vehicle basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.667" offset="3154651">These statutes provide that you can't carry one vehicle with more than so many found and you can't put more than so much of it on a particular axle.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.428" offset="3185685">You have to distribute the weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.522" offset="3194044">Now, it is our position that the -- that this Court in the Lilly case, has expressly reserved this so-called frustration theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.962" offset="3243781">And before reading the language of this Court, I'd like to point out that a number of cases have held that certain expenditures were not deductible, but if you get right down to it, the basis of the decision was that they were not ordinary and necessary.</text>

            <text syncTime="974.984" offset="3899873">Well, in one sense of the word, the Court -- and in -- this is particularly true in this companion case.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.774" offset="3923069">If the Court takes the position that Congress did not intend by passing the Revenue Act to differentiate between lawful and unlawful expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.429" offset="3957656">It says, all ordinary and necessary expenses are deductible.</text>

            <text syncTime="1008.755" offset="4034978">On the contrary, if it's an expense that cannot be avoided in spite of all reasonable care, then it is certainly ordinary and necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.449" offset="4069773">Now, this Court knows the -- the Interstate Commerce Commission fixes the rates that these carriers can charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.896" offset="4095582">They have all sorts of rates.</text>

            <text syncTime="1027.636" offset="4110524">And those volume rates are fixed on what a carrier can hold in one load -- what it cost him to hold it, of course, is the determining part of what the rate will be.</text>

            <text syncTime="1047.582" offset="4190250">Now, if the Court please, we don't -- I don't have too much time but I would like to emphasize two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.659" offset="4214596">This Court in the Lilly case says this, neither -- referring to the Heininger case, says, “Neither that decision nor the rule suggested by it, requires disallowance of petitioner's expenditures as deduction in the instant case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.061" offset="4268199">Now, this is the importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.548" offset="4274155">Assuming for the sake of argument, that's all this Court has ever said about the so-called frustration doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.547" offset="4298188">Assuming for the sake of argument that under some circumstances, business expenditures which are ordinary and necessary in the generally accepted meaning of those words may not be deducted as ordinary and necessary expenses under 23 (a) (1) (A) when they frustrate, sharply define national or state policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.173" offset="4380630">The conduct here does not fall within that category.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.297" offset="4393169">Now, in our case, if -- if this case go, it would -- if you -- if Your Honor should agree with us, it would have to go back to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.538" offset="4430054">I don't know whether you would go through the Court of Appeals or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.453" offset="4441757">But if the District Court finds this effect, which I'm sure you will, that we did not act with willful intent and that we did take all practical precautions, then they can't under any -- and as I see it, there can be no frustration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.372" offset="4497450">Now, we have one or two things that I think are material to show the congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.070" offset="4524199">The Revenue Act, by expressed terms, permits you to deduct gambling losses up to the extent of gambling games.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.413" offset="4553561">Well now, the Court, gambling is unlawful in most of the States, it's unlawful in Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.542" offset="4574145">But I can win a thousand dollars in a crap game and I've got to report it as income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.462" offset="4593789">I can go over and lose $800 in another crap game and I can deduct it, but that's -- that is violating the law of Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.348" offset="4621375">Now, if you carry this to its ultimate conclusion, the allowance of that deduction is going to frustrate the enforcement of the gambling laws in Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.039" offset="4648124">But Congress says, gambling is that losses are deductible up to that extent without regard to the law of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.319" offset="4673202">So we think that is material in determining, “Did Congress intend for an unavoidable expense that is certainly a business expense?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.002" offset="4707997">Should not be deducted because the various States by various legislation has denominated it a fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.257" offset="4732970">Now, in that regard, there are two or three things that I think are important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.111" offset="4752405">First, Kentucky and Tennessee are the States to which most of these fines were paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.187" offset="4776647">During these years and up until the middle 1953, Tennessee and Kentucky had much more restrictive weight limitation laws District -- than did the other States through which petitioner --</text>

            <text syncTime="1271.694" offset="5086772">One, in 1953, Tennessee amended its statute to increase the loads which resulted in 1953 being the smallest year that we involve with here dollar wise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.905" offset="5131598">In 1956, Kentucky amended its law, all of which raised them up to the keeping -- in keeping with the surrounding States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.216" offset="5168797">Now, those changes don't affect the liability for the finding but they do have a bearing on whether the allowance of these deductions are going to frustrate anything in these States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.015" offset="5207980">And one thing I think is quite important, Kentucky and its amendment, if the Court please, had a special section which provides that a -- an axle variation not to exceed 5% will not be a violation if the overall vehicle is within limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.364" offset="5273391">Now, there is a legislative recognition in Kentucky that a rigid axle weight is not realistic in this industry that you're going to have some leeway and some shifting.</text>

            <text syncTime="1399.234" offset="5596891">Second, that even if this Court should find that there is merit to the frustration theory that if -- if a taxpayer has done all that he can reasonably do, there can be no frustration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.806" offset="5639210">And therefore, that in either view, the Court takes of it that we are entitled to recover and it's an unfair and an undue burden to place on a carrier to say that he's got to pay a fine out of net income after taxes of an item that's just as much an expense item in this industry as is gasoline bill is.</text>
