            <text syncTime="6.174" offset="24660">At the recess, I was making the point that the finding of the trial court that petitioners had knowingly violated the order for their surrender was without support in the evidence as I recited it or indeed in the facts as found by the trial court itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.985" offset="111909">All of the evidence established was that petitioners knew that they were to be in Court on July 2nd.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.259" offset="145032">Knew that in all probability, they would be committed on that day and that they fled in order to avoid service of sentences which they knew were in store for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.249" offset="196963">But petitioners were not charged and could not have been convicted of contempt merely because a jump-bail and were fugitives from justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.937" offset="239700">They were charged with and convicted of knowing disobedience of a specific order for their surrender which they well knew to the outstanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.450" offset="285780">Proof that they had knowledge of the existence of that order was therefore required and there was no such proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.575" offset="318276">Apparently, the trial judge himself recognized the vulnerable -- vulnerability of this finding that petitioners have knowledge of the surrender order.</text>

            <text syncTime="112.087" offset="448261">In support of this finding that is that Green have notice of the order, the Court cited United States versus Hall, a Second Circuit decision in which the majority of the Court sustained the contempt conviction of another absconding Dennis defendant.</text>

            <label>Mr. John J. Abt</label>
            <text syncTime="179.889" offset="719517">-- had rested entirely on knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.321" offset="729234">However, of the -- when he got to write the opinion and he only wrote only one, he made the finding of notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.571" offset="754207">And as I say, in support of that finding, he cited United States versus Hall and that brings me necessarily to a consideration of the Second Circuit decision in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.724" offset="798824">The charge against Hall was identical with that on which the petitioners were tried and the evidence was substantially the same as in the present cases except that Hall was apprehended -- file of petitioners here voluntarily surrendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.177" offset="856607">Now, unlike the trial judge in these cases, the Court of Appeals in the Hall case did not find that Hall had actual knowledge of the surrender order.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.383" offset="897463">Instead, it sustained the conviction on a theory that Hall was chargeable with notice of the order because it found from the evidence that he had knowledge of the fact that an application for the order would be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.058" offset="952216">In other words, it held that knowledge of the application for the order was notice of the order itself and sufficient to hold Hall in that case, criminally liable for disobedience of the order once it was entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.559" offset="1022224">Now, it seems to me quite clear that there are three errors in this theory of guilt which I shall refer to as the notice theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.840" offset="1055347">In the first place, a person may not be convicted of criminal contempt of an order merely on proof that he knew that the order would be applied for and disobeyed it after it was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.600" offset="1110309">Proof of actual knowledge of the issuance of the order is required to sustain a conviction for criminal contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.266" offset="1141029">The majority involved relied in a dictum in Pettibone versus the United States cited by this Court, 148 United States, to support its notice theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.995" offset="1183974">I quote the passage from Hall from Pettibone at page 15 of my brief, it's very brief, perhaps I should take a moment to read it to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.009" offset="1231935">In Pettibone, the Court said and as I say the statement was clearly dictum.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.311" offset="1253146">"In matters of contempt, persons are not held liable for the breach of a restraining order or injunction unless they know or have notice or a chargeable with notice -- with knowledge or notice that the writ has been issued", and then follows the important phrase, "or the order entered or at least that application is to be made."</text>
            <text syncTime="337.141" offset="1348545">I think it's plain that the Court did not intend this statement to apply to criminal contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.244" offset="1380937">For the three authorities which it cites at the inclusion of the statement and which are quoted at pages 17 and 18 of my brief, all hold unequivocally that actual notice or knowledge of the making of an order is a prerequisite to conviction for criminal contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.640" offset="1454498">The only exception and it isn't a true exception at all as stated by Daniell in his chancery pleading and practice as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.478" offset="1489816">If the party remains in Court until the order is about to be made, he cannot by leaving at that instant, avoid its consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.594" offset="1534328">Now, a situation that Daniell described was of course not the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.260" offset="1553032">The petitioners were not in Court on July 2nd when the order was about to be made nor did they leave at that instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.832" offset="1595246">The notice theory of the Hall case is not only contrary to the authorities cited in the Pettibone case but as wholly unprecedented.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.892" offset="1639549">For as Judge Biggs stated in his dissent, the doctrine of constructive notice and that's what this really comes down to as I see it and as Judge Biggs did, has never before been substituted for proof of knowledge in a criminal contempt proceeding or in any other criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.293" offset="1717081">And in the case of In re Lennon decided by this Court in 166 United States and cited by the respondent in its brief, the Court flatly stated that proof of actual notice of an order is a prerequisite to a conviction for criminal contempt of the provisions of the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.537" offset="1802136">Moreover, as I show in my brief and as Judge Biggs pointed out in his dissent in the Hall case, the notice there is not only contrary to authority but denies the accused, the presumption of innocence and violates due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.694" offset="1874756">The second error in the notice theory of guilt is that the charge against petitioners was not that they had notice of the order as a matter of law but that they had actual knowledge of its existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.025" offset="1932016">Having been tried on the latter charge, their convictions cannot be sustained on an entirely different theory of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.005" offset="1967961">And finally, the notice theory is untenable because while petitioners, as it appear in the evidence, were told to appear in the court on July 2nd.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.546" offset="2014145">There was no evidence that they were informed or knew that application for a surrender order would be made on that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.951" offset="2043716">And there was therefore, no proof that they had knowledge of the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.518" offset="2058031">Indeed, as appears from the written opinion in the Green case, again in the record 67, the trial judge made no -- made no finding that the petitioners had knowledge that an application for the surrender order would be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.922" offset="2115605">All that he found was that petitioners were told to be in Court on July 2nd.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.655" offset="2142563">The Government in its brief, deliberately, I think confuses the knowledge and notice theories of guilt and argues as there were no distinction either in fact or in law between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.597" offset="2198361">It contends that the evidence shows that on June 29, 1951, petitioners knew that the entry of an order for their surrender -- and I quote from the Government's brief was both "certain and imminent."</text>
            <text syncTime="565.284" offset="2261055">From this, the Government argues that on July 2nd, petitioners must have known, and again I quote from their brief, "that the order they had every reason in the world to expect had in fact issued."</text>
            <text syncTime="581.161" offset="2324584">Thus, the Government's contention is that petitioners had actual knowledge of the issuance of the order of July 2nd because prior to July 2nd, they knew with certainty that it would issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.666" offset="2386651">Now, it seems to me that this argument revolves an obvious logical uncertainty for it is impossible to prove that petitioners knew that an order had been entered on the basis of evidence of what they knew or did before it wasn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.519" offset="2470034">Moreover, as the Government concedes, the Dennis fugitives appeared to be the only person in the whole course of our law against whom a surrender order was issued after they had absconded.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.728" offset="2534818">Accordingly, nothing had occurred prior to July 2nd could possibly have conveyed to them the knowledge that on that day, the Court would invoke a unique procedure which no judge or prosecutor had ever in the history of our law thought of before.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.273" offset="2609006">To use the Government's phrase, they had every reason in the world to expect that they'd be treated like all other absconders.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.709" offset="2646831">That is to say that their bail would be forfeited and a bench warrant issued for their arrest and that's all.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.630" offset="2686433">Now, obviously, if that's all that had occurred, they could not have been convicted of contempt.</text>

            <text syncTime="731.238" offset="2924878">But the Solicitor General cites no evidence and there is none as to when or how petitioners acquired this information.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.752" offset="2958942">It is reduced to suggesting that petitioners must have read newspaper reports of the entry of the order and that the Court should take judicial notice that they did so.</text>

            <text syncTime="787.865" offset="3151412">Knowledge as in the statute, anyone who knowingly fails to appear on his appearance (Inaudible) on bail.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.071" offset="3192268">All that is stated, the Government's position is that the petitioners, two Communist committed an obstruction of justice so flagrant that they are to be punished without regard for the presumption of the innocence or requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt and the guarantees of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.028" offset="3268023">Now, certainly, petitioners conduct was reprehensible but the violation of fundamental procedural rights on which their contempt -- convictions were based does not indicate the majesty of the law but defiles it, I submit.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.433" offset="3341688">My second point is that disobedience of an order for the appearance or surrender of a defendant enlarged on bail is not punishable as a contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.422" offset="3393620">Exhibit A in support of this proposition is the fact that the four Dennis fugitives are the first and to date the only absconders in the entire history of Anglo-American law who have been prosecuted for contempt of an order for their appearance or surrender.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.661" offset="3474599">In all other cases, absent a statute making bail jumping a crime, the practice in this country has been simply to forfeit the defendant's bail and issue a bench warrant for his arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.374" offset="3537398">As I shall attempt to show the use of the contempt power to punish the petitioners and the other Dennis absconders is not only unprecedented but it is also unauthorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.544" offset="3594136">First, as this Court has held and as the Government acknowledges, the contempt jurisdiction of the federal courts under Section 17 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 was utmost coextensive with the contempt jurisdiction that existed as common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.900" offset="3683579">But the common law did not punish absconding as a contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.023" offset="3704059">Instead, it employed a process of outlawry which became final only upon the failure of the fugitive to appear after his presence had been demanded in five successive county courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.524" offset="3774067">If he surrendered before the fifth demand for his appearance, he was not held in contempt for disobedience of the prior demands but suffered no punishment whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.238" offset="3824849">Since absconding in violation of an order for the appearance or surrender of a defendant was not a contempt to common law, it was not punishable as such under Section 7 of the Judiciary Act, the first Judiciary Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.850" offset="3899350">I demonstrate in my brief, pages 23 and 24.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.119" offset="3916382">I can't repeat the demonstration here that neither the Act of March 2nd, 1831, nor Section 401 of Title 18 under which the petitioners here were prosecuted, enlarged the categories of orders for disobedience of which the contempt power was available under the first Judiciary Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.480" offset="4013871">Accordingly, disobedience of a surrender order, if it couldn't have been punished as a contempt under the first Judiciary Act, is not punishable under Section 401.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.739" offset="4066952">The Government argues that since disobedience of a subpoena is punishable as a contempt, the same remedy should be available for disobedience of an order for appearance for surrender.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.607" offset="4122331">Thus, the two orders -- the two kinds of main process are very much alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.311" offset="4145215">But there are two crucial differences between the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.454" offset="4161724">In the first place, disobedience of a subpoena was always punished as a contempt of common law, the file as I have shown, disobedience of his surrender order was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.802" offset="4211148">In the second place, contempt is the only remedy for a violation of the subpoena in the absence of a statute of course, making it a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.737" offset="4250854">While there has always been other means of indicating the authority of the Court against absconders, that is to say the process outlawry until the Government's disuse and today a forfeiture of bail and arrest.</text>

            <text syncTime="1091.309" offset="4365166">Never -- no reported case of such of a prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.387" offset="4385541">There are two state cases cited in my brief in which a contempt proceeding was instituted against a defendant who failed to appear but of course no order for the appearance had been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.542" offset="4442070">The Court -- courts in both those state cases held that -- obviously there was no contempt because there -- there was no order if -- no disobedience to any order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.260" offset="4488986">But there never has been a case, Your Honor, reported case anywhere in England or in this country, of a prosecution of this character.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.283" offset="4529110">And since as I say other remedies have been available or violations for bail jumping or for violation of an order for appearance or surrender, there is no foundation and necessity for the unprecedented use of the contempt power against the Dennis fugitives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.069" offset="4628271">Finally, this judicial innovation and it's surely was that has been employed, I think, in a discriminatory and indicative manner which should condemn it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.215" offset="4680829">For it was invoked for the first and the last time at the height of the anti-communist hysteria against four communists as a device for keeping additional punishment upon them over and above their sentences for a political crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.617" offset="4762436">The third and the final point that I shall argue is that the trial court was without power to sentence petitioners to prison terms in excess of one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.059" offset="4820219">The point presents a question which this Court has never had occasioned to consider, that is, do the federal courts have unlimited power to punish criminal contempts by penitentiary sentences or any term whatsoever including 99 years or life time?</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.339" offset="4909349">Petitioners believe that this question must be answered in the negative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.383" offset="4929515">It is our position that the power of the federal courts to punish criminal contempts is restricted to the imposition of sentence as in the case of offenses which are not infamous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.854" offset="4987402">Now, since 1885, an infamous offense, as been defined by this Court as one which may be punished by confinement in a penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.159" offset="5040588">That was first held in Mackin versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.271" offset="5061068">Section 4083 of Title 18, authorizes confinement in a penitentiary where the term is for more than one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.527" offset="5102028">It follows that all of offenses that may be punished by imprisonment or a term of more than a year are infamous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.364" offset="5141420">Hence, if contempt is not an infamous offense, it may not be punished by a sentence in excess of a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.154" offset="5176529">To put my position in other words, it is that a criminal contempt as misdemeanor and not a felony as these two terms are defined in Section 1 of Title 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.830" offset="5231282">The conclusion that criminal contempt is not subject to infamous punishment is required, I believe, by Section 401 of Title 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.087" offset="5272346">By Section 24 of the Clayton Act, now Section 402 of Title 18 and by Rule 7 (a) of the criminal rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.449" offset="5313724">Moreover, a contrary conclusion should be avoided that that is possible and I think it is, because such a conclusion would violate the requirement of the Fifth Amendment that infamous crimes must be prosecuted by indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.457" offset="5381747">I first consider Section 401.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.279" offset="5401078">That Section in language derived from the Section 17 of the first Judiciary Act, authorizes a court to punish contempts by fine or imprisonment at its discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.571" offset="5462204">Now, the Government, like the court below, argues that the phrase "at its discretion" answers the question how long a term of imprisonment which is normally answered to -- in a criminal statute by a specific number of years and answers that question, how long a term of imprisonment by leaving the length of a sentence to the discretion of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.011" offset="5563977">However, the relevant question to which an answer must be sought from Section 401 is not as to the length of the sentence but as to its character, that is to say whether or not the section authorizes infamous punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.903" offset="5647569">Now, when the reference to discretion was written into Section 17 of the first Judiciary Act in 1789, there was no statute on the books like Section 4083 of Title 18 which determined the character of a sentence by reference to its language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.353" offset="5729384">Indeed, the first Judiciary Act antedated by almost a century, the emergence of the concept that confinement in a penitentiary constitutes infamous punishment while a confinement in a common jail does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.890" offset="5803468">In 1789, it was not the place or the term of the confinement but such super added incidence of the imprisonment as hard labor or the pillory which determined the infamous character of the sentence -- of the punishment rather.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.950" offset="5879745">Since none of this incidence was authorized by the Act of 1789, that Act did not authorize infamous punishment for contempt as infamous punishment was conceived of at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.935" offset="5939722">Hence, in historical context, the phrase imprisonment at its discretion that now appears in Section 401, does not authorize infamous punishment for contempt even if it's to be said to give the Court discretion over the length of the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.660" offset="6026553">The very best I think that can be said of the punishment provisions of Section 401 is that they're ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.946" offset="6059781">That would be true under the rule of strict constructions, the punishment may not be infamous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.813" offset="6091233">My brief cites a long line of state court decisions to that effect including one that arose under a contempt statute, an Oklahoma statute substantially identical with Section 401 which it was held that the statute for the reasons I've indicated didn't authorize infamous punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.597" offset="6178377">Furthermore, the fact is that the limitation on the power to punish which as I've tried to show was inherent in Section 401 and its predecessors was adhered to in practice from 1789 until 1916.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.103" offset="6256327">During that entire period, there was not a single reported incidence of infamous punishment for contempt in either the federal or the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.644" offset="6306482">This century in the quarter of undeviating practice even if it is not required by Section 17 of the Act of 1789 and its successors, was frozen into law by Section 24 of the Clayton Act of 1914 to which I now turn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.961" offset="6403762">Sections 21 and 22 of the Clayton Act, they're set forth at pages 84 and 85 of the respondent's brief, required jury trials and limit imprisonment to a maximum of six months for contemptuous conduct and disobedience of a court order provided that such conduct also constitutes a crime under federal or state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.457" offset="6525806">That's Section 21 and Section 22.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.457" offset="6541793">Section 24 of the same Act, accomplishes two purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.842" offset="6567288">First, it provides at the jury trial and maximum punishment provisions of Section 22 shall not apply to contempts committed in the presence of the Court or so near as to obstruct justice or to contempts like those about here of orders entered in suits brought by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.003" offset="6675958">That's the first thing that Section 24 does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.758" offset="6686929">But Section 24 does something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.164" offset="6700617">It further provides that contempts of the kinds that I have just described and I quote, "May be punished in conformity to the usages and equity and law now prevailing".</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.013" offset="6759967">The legislative history contains no discussion of the second clause which I call the prevailing usage clause of Section 24.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.690" offset="6798733">But it finally provides that contempts of the kinds described in Section 24, shall be punished in accordance with the usage that prevailed in 1914 when the Clayton Act was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.188" offset="6872712">As I have shown, the usage that prevailed without exception from 1789 until 1916, two years after the Clayton Act, was to punish contempt as an offense not infamous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.881" offset="6939481">Hence, even were the court to hold that this limitation on the power to punish is not inherent in Section 401 and its predecessors, it was given the force of law by the prevailing usage clause of the Clayton Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2102.277" offset="8409025">The substance of Section 24 of the Clayton Act was incorporated in Section 402 of Title 18 when the criminal statutes were revised and codified in 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.835" offset="8463256">The codification modified some of the wording of Section 24, but as my brief shows and as the Government does not deny, the codification did not alter the substance of the original enactment and these are adviser's notes to Section 402 which were made a part of the House and Senate committee reports specifically state that the changes in phraseology did not change the meaning or substance of Section 24.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.956" offset="8575791">Accordingly, Section 402 like its predecessor codifies the usage which prevailed in 1914, prohibits infamous punishment for contempt and by virtue of Section 4083 of Title 18, limits the maximum sentence for contempt for one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.384" offset="8657502">The Government makes two replies to this contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.304" offset="8673176">First, it says that if Section 24 of the Clayton Act had been intended to set a maximum prison term for the contempts excluded from Section 22, Congress would have done so by expressly limiting the sentence to one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.529" offset="8742034">In effect, the Solicitor General argues that because the prevailing usage clause employs what he characterizes as certain elocutionary language, the clause should be disregarded altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.468" offset="8797832">Or he insist that the sole purpose of Section 24 was to confine the jury trial and six months sentence provisions of Section 22 for the type of contempt described in Section 21.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.185" offset="8864705">As I have shown, however, that purpose was accomplished by these explicit provisions of the first clause of Section 24.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.233" offset="8896888">Hence, the respondent's reading of Section 24 makes the prevailing usage clause completely redundant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.799" offset="8943177">Second, the Government cites a number of federal cases subsequent to the enactment of the Clayton Act in which contempt sentences of more than one year were imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.272" offset="8993019">Before coming to these cases, I want to say a word about state law on the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.557" offset="9014126">There have been only three reported instances of infamous punishment for contempt in the state courts and in all three of these cases the sentences were reversed as beyond the power of the Court to impose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.894" offset="9071491">Currently, the punishment for contempt is regulated by statute in 36 states.</text>

            <text syncTime="2277.379" offset="9109420">Well, we're not on the statutory ground, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.271" offset="9121019">That is some of the particular statutory grounds I discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.186" offset="9132722">In one of the cases it was reversed on constitutional ground, the grounds that Mr. Justice Frankfurter was discussing a moment ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.149" offset="9168562">And the other two, the reversal was on the ground that unless the statute specifically and expressly provides for infamous punishment, infamous punishment may not be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.477" offset="9225822">In furtherance, I say the punishment for contempt is regulated by statute in 36 states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.780" offset="9247033">I summarized the statutes at page 45 of my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.887" offset="9263543">None of them authorizes infamous punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.252" offset="9276918">Nineteen states fixed the maximum term at 30 days or less and of the 29 states which specify the length of the sentence, only two authorize imprisonment for a period as long as one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.443" offset="9345672">I turn now to the federal authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.342" offset="9361345">Since 1914, the date of the Clayton Act, there had been nine reported cases in which infamous punishment, that is sentence of more than one year, has been affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.516" offset="9414008">With one exception, however, the question of the power of the Court to impose infamous punishment was not raised or considered in any of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.486" offset="9453923">The exception is Creekmore versus United States decided by the Eighth Circuit in 1916, two years after the enactment of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.229" offset="9492898">The decision, however, does not mention the prevailing usage clause which evidently had not been called to the attention of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.049" offset="9528111">This Court has affirmed a criminal contempt sentence of more than one year in only case, Hill versus United States decided in 1937.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.973" offset="9571892">All that that case decided, however, was at the maximum sentence of six months specified in Section 22 of the Clayton Act is inapplicable to contempt for disobedience of an order entered in an action brought by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.084" offset="9636258">Thus, the Court in this case is free to write on a clean slate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.384" offset="9661440">Now, I don't suppose that there can ever be a dogmatic answer to any novel question of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.349" offset="9685368">And this is certainly, particularly true when the question lies in the difficult area of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.506" offset="9721940">But it seems to me that it's not necessary to establish that mine is the only possible interpretation of the contempt statutes which I have discussed and of Rule 7 (a) of the Criminal Rules which I discussed in my brief (Inaudible) further here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.524" offset="9790067">It is enough for the purposes of this case that the interpretation for which I contend is tenable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.882" offset="9815458">If so, I submit it should be adopted for a contrary conclusion would pose a major constitutional question which as this Court has so often held should be avoided if possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.711" offset="9870838">The question is one which the Court has never had occasion to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.161" offset="9892571">It arises from the requirement of the Fifth Amendment that infamous crime, that is crimes that are punishable by infamous punishment must be prosecuted by indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.126" offset="9944503">The Government contends that the question is insubstantial because criminal contempt is sui generis and hence is not a crime within the meaning of the amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.390" offset="9989538">But I think that the question cannot be so lightly dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.351" offset="10009391">As Mr. Justice Holmes said of criminal contempts in the first (Inaudible) case and I quote him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.848" offset="10035304">"If such acts are not criminal, we are in error as to the most fundamental characteristic of crimes as that word has been understood in English speech".</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.964" offset="10079817">Accordingly, many constitutional and statutory provisions for the protection of those accused of crime had been held applicable to prosecutions for criminal contempt including such the other guarantees of the Fifth Amendment against double jeopardy and compelled testimony against one's self.</text>

            <text syncTime="2552.769" offset="10211056">But the fact is that this Court has held for example that the double jeopardy and provision and the guarantee against compelled testimony of the Fifth Amendment are applicable to criminal contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.211" offset="10272810">The exception is the holding that criminal contempt sui generis with respect to the constitutional requirement of a jury trial in criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.558" offset="10318158">As I show in my briefs, this exception appears to rest on an erroneous reading of history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.572" offset="10342191">And the court below agreed that was the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.393" offset="10357551">Certainly, a substantial constitutional question as presented by the decision below and the contention of the Government which would compound this error of history by a ruling that criminal contempt is not a crime within the indictment requirement of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.817" offset="10435187">The construction of the contempt statutes and of Rule 7 (a) of the Criminal Rules for which I contend avoids the constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.976" offset="10471863">It equates the power of federal judges to punish criminal contempt with the power that they exercise during the first century and a quarter of our history and which still prevails in every state and it implements what seems to me to be the sound democratic principle that no court should be called with limitless power over the extent and character of the punishment that it may impose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.327" offset="10597251">To conclude, as I have shown, the cases of petitioners and the other two Dennis' fugitives are wholly without precedent in three respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.590" offset="10646256">First, in the use of the contempt power as a device for punishing absconders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.720" offset="10674782">Second, the theory of the evidence on which their convictions were faced and third in the severity of their sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.857" offset="10715324">In each of these respects, the convictions and sentences are not only unprecedented but are unauthorized by law and impinged on constitutionally protected rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.070" offset="10768196">A reversal, I submit, is therefore required.</text>

            <text syncTime="2700.924" offset="10803618">Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.320" offset="10825247">I shall attempt to address myself to the questions which have been presented by petitioners in the same order that petitioners' counsel had done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.305" offset="10877179">That brings me first therefore to the contention that the Government failed adequately to prove in this case that the petitioners had knowledge of the order which they were charged was willfully violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.922" offset="10959621">I'd like to review very briefly the sequence of events, the circumstances which bear on the question of proof of knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.336" offset="11005283">Perhaps first, I should say that we contend on two bases that this aspect of the Government case was made out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.833" offset="11047288">The first is that petitioners are chargeable as a matter of law with knowledge of the order which was ultimately issued and the second is that there was an adequate basis for the Court's finding that there was in fact such knowledge on their part.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.429" offset="11121685">Now, the sequence of event is I think important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.225" offset="11136836">As pointed out earlier, the petitioners were out on bail during the course of their appeals from the conviction in the main case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.496" offset="11193887">The affirmance by the Second Circuit took place in 1950 and this Court's decision in the Dennis case was handed down on June 4, 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.645" offset="11266508">Thereafter, an application was made to Mr. Justice Jackson for a stay of this Court's mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.352" offset="11297332">It was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.590" offset="11310289">The United States attorney thereafter proceeded on June 28, 1951 to serve a notice on all of the defendants in the Dennis case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.927" offset="11371624">That notice was served together with a proposed order and it appears in the record at page 57 of the notice and then the order which was ultimately signed by Judge Ryan appears on pages 59 and 60.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.445" offset="11461695">Your Honors will note that that is an order on mandate which is specific, which is complete in its detail, down to the point that it provides that the defendant shall surrender themselves in room 318 of the courthouse at Foley Square on the 2nd of July at 11:05 in the forenoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.146" offset="11588545">Your Honors, will also note from the notice of settlement of that order on page 57 that the application for the signature of this order was to be presented at 10 o'clock on July 2nd.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.884" offset="11651448">In substance then, the U.S. Attorney put the defendants in the Dennis case on notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.448" offset="11685721">That on July 2nd in the morning and July 2nd was a Monday, he would present to the Court for signature an order which would require them to surrender themselves for their -- for the service if their sentence that same morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.324" offset="11753221">Now, as I say, this notice of settlement and the proposed order was served on June 28.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.322" offset="11789270">On June 29, Friday, June 29, petitioners through their counsel, went before Judge Ryan who was the judge scheduled to sit in criminal motions for the following Monday.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.814" offset="11855203">And as petitioner's counsel has pointed out, they make certain motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.260" offset="11876937">One of the motions or applications which they presented to Judge Ryan on Friday, June 29 was their request made on behalf of all of the Dennis defendants that the dates for their commitment, they put over until after the July 4th holiday.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.289" offset="11957081">Judge Ryan did not grant that motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.126" offset="11968470">He did not act on any of the applications made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.758" offset="11986965">He did tell the petitioner's counsel that he wanted them to be sure to bring all of the defendant into the courtroom on the following Monday morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.267" offset="12040986">The counsel agreed to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.131" offset="12060421">And as testified later at the hearing on contempt, counsel, did in fact inform all of the Dennis defendants that they were to be in court on the following Monday morning.</text>

            <text syncTime="3045.987" offset="12183928">There is a -- some of that colloquy comes in the form of a quotation of the earlier colloquy given at the ultimate hearing on contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.146" offset="12248503">Now, these circumstances that are just recited seem to us to show that the petitioners on June 29, certainly, knew that the entry of the order on mandate was certain and imminent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.920" offset="12311615">Incidentally, I have not mentioned that appears also that the reason of the hearing was set for July 2nd was that that was date that it was anticipated that this Court's mandate was going to be received by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.361" offset="12373368">In other words, the U.S. Attorney had ascertained when this Court's mandate would come down and he had learned apparently that it was going to be there by the second and therefore filed -- prepared an order which would have permitted the Dennis defendants on that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.532" offset="12450064">In addition to being aware of the proposed order which had been served on their counsel, petitioners were aware that the United State's attorney and subsequently Judge Ryan on June 29 had not favorably entertained a request to put over the date of the commitment until after the July 4th holiday.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.498" offset="12545985">We submit in a word that petitioners knew that the end of the road has been reached and that they were about to be required to begin asserting their sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.551" offset="12598126">So notified, we think, petitioners could not disappear on the eve or the virtual eve of the date of surrender and then claim that they were not chargeable with knowledge of the order as issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.577" offset="12662282">Anymore, we think, than somebody who knows an injunction is about to issue can go out and change the facts and put the matter beyond the jurisdiction of the Court before the judge puts it in to paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.421" offset="12725603">Anymore we think, than someone about to be served and knowing he is about to be served with an order for production of document can go out and say, "We've got to hurry and burn the papers, the judge is just about to sign the order."</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.968" offset="12791850">Now, we think that is the fair meaning of the rule stated in the Pettibone case to which Mr. Abt earlier made reference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.749" offset="12834900">As the Court will recall, it was said in that case that somebody is chargeable if he had -- or is not chargeable unless he at least has notice of the pendency of the proceedings or that an application is about to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.107" offset="12920372">Now, here we say, petitioners knew far more than that an application was to be made.</text>

            <text syncTime="4368.182" offset="17472679">We've argued both from (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="4375.660" offset="17502563">Turning to the second argument that petitioners had made, it is that contempt doesn't cover willful disobedience of an order to surrender for commitment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4387.439" offset="17549688">Now, of course, 18 U.S.C. 401 covers willful disobedience of any lawful order of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4395.661" offset="17582602">And therefore, what petitioners are saying is that this Court should carve out an exception for the class of orders of the type here involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4408.728" offset="17634847">And it supports that by saying that there are no common law cases involving the matter of treating absconding as a contempt and therefore, the argument is, you shouldn't regard it as within the historic framework or historic meaning of contempt to court as used in these country's contempt statutes since 1789.</text>
            <text syncTime="4436.726" offset="17746860">Now, we think to rely on the common law here is to look at history through blinders.</text>
            <text syncTime="4445.004" offset="17779984">It's true that one who was indicted for a crime at common law and then failed to appear at his trial was not attached for contempt but the reason was that the common law had available to it, what was a greatly heightened form of contempt process with far more baneful sanction, the process with outlawry, which Pollock and Maitland described as an engine for compelling the contumacious and I emphasize that word to abide the judgment of the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4479.458" offset="17917806">Now, if a criminal defendant failed to appear after having been five times summoned for his trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4487.182" offset="17948630">If he failed to appear at common law, he was a convict of outlawry.</text>
            <text syncTime="4492.180" offset="17968692">That meant that there was a total forfeiture of his property.</text>
            <text syncTime="4496.734" offset="17986873">It meant that anybody might hunt him down because he was beyond the bail and protection of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4503.309" offset="18013205">It meant that he's apprehended.</text>
            <text syncTime="4505.511" offset="18021982">He stood convict without further trial of the substantive offense for which he had been indicted which in turn meant that if he had been indicted originally for a common law felony that he was subject to capital punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4519.541" offset="18078093">So, it will hardly do, I think, to suggest that the failure of a criminal defendant to answer the process of the Court was likely regarded as common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4534.882" offset="18139429">Professor Beale has stated in his article on Contempt of Court that the word "contempt" is a very old word to cover any act done in violation of a direct order of the King for any governmental process.</text>
            <text syncTime="4557.453" offset="18229812">He goes on to show in that same article that some of the earliest cases of contempt and trial of contempts by courts involved failures of parties to appear in response to process.</text>
            <text syncTime="4577.977" offset="18311837">He mentioned that in the time of Henry II.</text>
            <text syncTime="4581.187" offset="18324689">It was laid down that if a tenant duly summoned in the Court was absent, the King or his justices might have their pleasure, punish him for his contempt of court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4593.115" offset="18372441">Now, a common place of course to this day, that a witness who fails to respond to a subpoena, a party who fails to produce documents in response to an order of discovery, a party who fails to honor other form of process is liable in contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="4615.491" offset="18461884">And we see no basis for making the suggestion that a criminal defendant and especially one who has first exhausted all the processes of the law that there's any left to contempt for him to flout the order of the Court to appear and to begin serving his penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="4640.320" offset="18561254">Petitioners also say that if this, as the Government argues, is a contempt within a classic category, why is it that there are no other reported cases involving a proceeding for contempt for a violation of this kind of order.</text>
            <text syncTime="4664.262" offset="18656967">I think that the dearth of such cases has a ready explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4671.756" offset="18686955">Under the contempt statutes, I don't think there would be any basis for a proceeding unless, first, a specific order had been laid at the door of the party who was to appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="4687.731" offset="18750903">And in the nature of things, most bail jumping occurs before the Court ever gets around to setting a time and place certain for a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4699.245" offset="18796878">If in this case, as I earlier remarked, the petitioners had left town the day this Court decided the Dennis case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4709.885" offset="18839510">There would have been no notice of settlement of an order of mandate, no possibility of serving such a notice on them and I don't think we could lay a foundation by way of showing the issuance of a specific order --</text>

            <text syncTime="5923.577" offset="23694211">And he argues that it wasn't until the early 18th century that such constructive contempts were dealt with by attachment for contempt rather than by ordinary criminal law procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="5939.943" offset="23759726">He says at the same time that contempt in the presence of the Court and contempt by disobedience of process or court order was punished from early common law through attachment for contempt.</text>

            <text syncTime="6899.736" offset="27598890">It seems to me that a normal first reaction to the facts of this case and I take it that that was the reaction of this Court is that the man who absconds after his conviction and certainly after his conviction has been affirmed by this Court is guilty of some kind of an offense for which he ought to be punished.</text>
            <text syncTime="6922.086" offset="27688333">But the fact to the matter is, if the Court please, that except where a statute makes bail jumping a crime, neither the Government nor I have been able to find any case in which an absconder has suffered any punishment other than the forfeiture of his bail and the issuance of a bench warrant for his arrest, if that be called punishment.</text>

            <text syncTime="6967.123" offset="27868473">But what I said applies to any kind of absconding whether there --- there has never been a case before as I've said earlier in which an order to surrender was entered against the defendant after he have absconded, just never heard anybody before.</text>
            <text syncTime="6982.477" offset="27929809">Now, certainly if no order had been entered in this case, no surrender order had ever been entered in this case, there couldn't have been a contempt prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="6990.576" offset="27962201">And similarly, it seems to me that if the defendant didn't know that a contempt order was entered, he can't be held in contempt any more than he could have been of no order at the moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="7003.740" offset="28014864">Now, the only evidence that the Government has been able to -- even to suggest of actual knowledge of the order, is contained in the statements that the defendants issued immediately prior to their surrender, which as the Government says, indicated that they knew they were fugitives.</text>
            <text syncTime="7021.676" offset="28086648">Well of course, they knew they were fugitives, nobody could deny that.</text>
            <text syncTime="7025.580" offset="28102217">The Government says, since they knew that they were fugitives, they must have known that the order for their surrender had been entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="7033.768" offset="28135027">But the Government's conclusion doesn't follow from its premise.</text>
            <text syncTime="7038.216" offset="28152790">If the Court had done what every -- so far as I've been able to discover, every court has done in the past really forfeited the defendant's bail.</text>
            <text syncTime="7047.565" offset="28190198">When his bail was forfeited and he became fugitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="7053.413" offset="28213603">And all -- when -- when the statements -- and I agree with Mr. Spritzer, the statements indicate that the man knew they were fugitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="7061.474" offset="28245891">But it doesn't indicate that they knew that they were fugitives by virtue of the entry of the surrender order.</text>
            <text syncTime="7065.712" offset="28262818">They could just as well have been fugitives by virtue of the forfeiture of their bail.</text>
            <text syncTime="7070.538" offset="28282149">And as I say, that's -- that's the only bit of evidence and that there is no evidence that the Government concedes on as evidence of knowledge.</text>

            <text syncTime="7100.664" offset="28402625">And what Mr. Spritzer said I think in answer to a question by Mr. Justice Black is that Justice Black said, "Will, the law -- as I understood you, sir, you said, "Will the law imply knowledge in a criminal case?"</text>
            <text syncTime="7116.303" offset="28465110">And Mr. Spritzer answered, "Yes, the law will imply knowledge when not to do so would permit a defendant to flout the law."</text>
            <text syncTime="7123.621" offset="28494472">Well, that's to me like saying that because you think a man is guilty and ought to be punished, you punish him even though we've got no evidence that he is guilty and you can't prove he's guilty under reasonable doubt.</text>
