            <text syncTime="7.986" offset="31869">Mr. Manoli, you may continue with your argument.</text>

          <turn speaker="dominick_l_manoli" startTime="10.787" stopTime="252.113">
            <label>Mr. Dominick L. Manoli</label>
            <text syncTime="10.787" offset="43050">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.954" offset="51722">On the Court arose yesterday, I was making the point that Congress was aware of these hot cargo agreements between employer's and unions and was also aware of the practices of these unions to invoke these hot cargo labels, these hot cargo contracts and appeal directly to the employee's not to handle disfavored goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.920" offset="151615">We believed that Congress intended to draw no distinction between union appeals to the employee's where there were no hot cargo contracts between the union and the employer and situations where there are.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.081" offset="212323">The statute itself, as I indicated briefly yesterday, the statute itself Section 8 (b) (4) (A) of the statute broadly prohibits secondary work stoppages for the purpose of compelling some other employer to yield the union's demands or because these goods are disfavored.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.316" offset="293198">Where Congress wanted to draw an exception to the broad reach of Section 8 (b) (4), it did so expressly.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.962" offset="319843">Thus, for example, in Section 8 (b) (4) (B) the companion Section to 8 (b) (4) (A), Congress withdrew from the reach of Section 8 (b) (4) (A), secondary work stoppages for the purpose of compelling an employer to recognize a certified bargain represented.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.653" offset="386612">Similarly, in Section 8 (d) of the statute, which deals with jurisdictional strikes, Congress again expressly, removed from the reach of the statute such strikes where the employer was failing to honor a board certificate or a board order.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.331" offset="453277">And finally, in the proviso to Section 8 (b) (4) itself, Congress expressly removed from the reach -- if, Your Honors are looking for the statute, it's at page -- at page 66 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.350" offset="573336">The proviso that I'm speaking of, page 67 about the middle of the page, that in that proviso to Section 8 (b) (4), Congress specifically removed from the broad reach of Section 8 (b) (4) (A), refuses to cross a picket line at a primary employer's place of business which had been established by the recognized bargain representative of the employee's.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.528" offset="666018">Now, it seems to us that these expressed exceptions for the broad reach of Section 8 (b) (4) (A) suggests that if Congress had wanted to remove union appeals, the union inducements to the employee's to engage in a secondary or sympathetic work stoppages where there was an existence a hot cargo contract between the employer of the union that it would have expressly made such an exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.771" offset="762984">Now, Congress certainly knew how to do that and I think that this is illustrated by the proviso to Section 8 (a) (3) of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.648" offset="794540">Section 8 (a) (3) of the statute deals with discrimination by an employer on the basis of union membership or non-membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.577" offset="826305">Congress wanted to remove from the broad reach of that Section, union shop contracts, and it expressly provided in the proviso to Section 8 (a) (3) that such contracts when entered into executed under the circumstances indicated in the statute itself that these contracts which of course compel the employee's to join the union after certain period of time that they were removed from the broad reach of Section 8 (a) (3).</text>
            <text syncTime="233.288" offset="933094">So here, I repeat, that certainly, Congress knew how to do it, that if they wanted to remove secondary work stoppages from the reach of Section 8 (b) (4) (A) where there were -- was an existence a hot cargo contract between the union and the employer, it seems to us that the most natural thing would have been for Congress to have said so specifically.</text>

            <text syncTime="273.345" offset="1093277">Now, if it did outlaw them, did it make them illegal?</text>

            <text syncTime="276.468" offset="1105816">It did not outlaw them, but it did not affirmatively sanction them.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.586" offset="1126296">Now, the Board's position on that is this, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.210" offset="1136744">A majority of the board, in these cases have concluded that while Section 8 (b) (4) (A) does not in turns outlaw the making of these contracts that nevertheless the statute prohibits the inducement of employee's without any qualification based upon these contracts and that the -- when the union, it goes to the employers and makes direct appeals to the employee's to engage in the sympathetic work stoppages that the union has violated the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="406.167" offset="1624607">Now, however, though, it is conceded that even though these contracts may be against the policy of the statute that nevertheless, Section 8 (b) (4) (A) does not reach the making of these contracts or does not reach the employer's carrying out the contract, but that's what the statute does reach, as I say, is the Union's direct appeals to the employee's.</text>

            <text syncTime="449.253" offset="1796911">Now, the further fact that suggests to us that the Congress meant to draw no distinction between situations, whether it's a hot cargo and whether it's not, Senator Taft's explanation of -- one of the -- an explanation that he advised and the course to debate on the Senate floor, he said that the Committee, the Senate Labor Committee have heard testimony for weeks as to the difference between good and secondary boycotts and that nobody had ever succeeded.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.514" offset="1914044">So he said, "Had ever succeeded and explained to them the difference between these different types of boycotts."</text>
            <text syncTime="483.639" offset="1934524">And so he said, "We have made all of these secondary work stoppages an unfair labor practice."</text>
            <text syncTime="490.512" offset="1962005">Now, the argument is made and we've already touched upon this in answer to Mr. Justice Brennan's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.189" offset="1996696">The argument is made that these contracts are not on law and that therefore, if they're not unlawful, there should be no reason why the Union under -- could not invoke this contract and appeal to the employer's directly to do what the contract presumably permits the employee's to do, that is to refrain from having disfavored goods.</text>

            <text syncTime="517.251" offset="2069002">Now, if you have -- if you have this kind of a clause, how could they enforce?</text>
            <text syncTime="522.554" offset="2090214">It is against the employer if they didn't force against the employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="529.434" offset="2117695">Your Honor, assuming that we are correct in our view that these clauses do not permit a union to go to the employee's and even though it may be true that the statute does not outlaw the making of these contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.512" offset="2190002">Nevertheless, if a union were to go in court, let's say Section 301, seeks specific performance to this kind of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.290" offset="2221140">I think the problem would be raised whether these contracts are not against the policy of the statute that there are way of circumventing the protection which a statute, as I will point out later, which a statute intends to give to the public to other employee's at large and possibly and I am only speculating on this because it's a very difficult question.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.839" offset="2307344">Possibly a court of law even though we ourselves cannot reach the execution of the contract is an unfair labor practice that a court of law might declare these contracts to be against public policy and hence unenforceable and that the only thing that the Union can do in answer to Your Honors question is simply make an appeal to the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.266" offset="2372963">If the employer goes, it may have no more than that, simply that the employer will respect the commitment or not but not to be able to enforce it either by strike action.</text>

            <text syncTime="989.980" offset="3959850">Now, let me turn now to the statute itself and indicate how we think this case fits into the statutory phraseology.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.851" offset="4007393">As I said yesterday, the violation consists of three elements, namely the inducement of employee's, secondly, the concerted refusal on the course of their employment, and third, the illegal object of forcing or requiring any employer or other person to cease doing business or handling the products of another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.124" offset="4092447">We think that all these three elements here despite the hot cargo clause are present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.895" offset="4111569">As to the first element, the element of inducement, I need not draw on that very long because the record amply shows that both the machinist and the teamsters appealed or directed the employer's to carriers not to handle the goods of American Iron and indeed and its answer to the Board's complaint, the Teamsters freely admitted that they had directed the employee's of the carriers not to handle these goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.590" offset="4198296">Now, the second element is the element of concerted refusal in the course of their employment and I will break those into two sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.967" offset="4231837">Certainly and literally, we think that there was a concerted refusal in this case and that whether or not, the employer was consenting is wholly irrelevant because the significant factor is that the Union had induced in a concerted refusal on the part of the employee's towards American Freight, American Iron freight.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.086" offset="4308323">Now, the argument is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.763" offset="4315011">It has been made in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.320" offset="4321280">It's been in other the courts which have disagreed with us, that cons -- the term concerted refusal like the term strike presupposes action in defiance of the employer's wishes and normally of course that is -- that is the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.117" offset="4380421">But we think that Congress in using the term concerted refusal in the statute is meant to go beyond that and they meant to include concerted refusals by employee's even though -- even in cases where the employer was acquiesce in that -- in that conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="1142.707" offset="4570802">Of the employee's.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.092" offset="4576340">Concerted refusal (Voice Overlap) by the employee's, that's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.609" offset="4598387">The -- the Case Bill as it left the House, had a provision which banned secondary boycotts and it provided that it shall be unlawful by means of a concerted refusal to use hand the law otherwise do et cetera or to induce or require or attempt to induce or require another person to recognize, deal with, comply with and -- or employee, members of any labor organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.855" offset="4703399">Now, when the case still came to the Senate, Senator Ball and Taft, who of course were among the principal proponents of the Taft-Hartley Bill in the following session of Congress, introduced this amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.553" offset="4754181">They wanted to make it a violation to the antitrust law for labor organization by strikes or threats of strike or by concerted refusal to use, handle, transport or otherwise deal, the language is almost identical with Section 8 (b) (4) (A) from thereon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.775" offset="4819069">They had added to the House Bill which contained that it was unlawful to engage in a concerted refusal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.963" offset="4839758">They added the word strikes or threats of strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.743" offset="4854909">Now, explaining the addition of the word strike and also explaining the -- what they thought concerted refusal meant in the context of that -- both of that bill, Senator Ball said, "We had to include the word strikes because obviously if the construction union says we will put on our own fair list this product made by General Electric or Westinghouse, we will not use it."</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.871" offset="4955429">And the employer says, "Well, I will go along."</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.292" offset="4965146">And he merely stacks it up in the corner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.922" offset="4975595">That is a concerted refusal to use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.731" offset="4986880">The example that he gives there is one with employer's acquiescing in the employee's refusal and Senator Ball says that is a concerted refusal to use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.097" offset="5024287">Then he goes on to explain what is meant by strike that strike was something in defiance of the employer's wishes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.483" offset="5053858">So here, it seems to us that the use of the term concerted refusal in our statute which is in a context almost parallel to the one of this Ball Amendment in the Case Bill that it suggest to us that Congress meant to give the term concerted refusal a broader meaning that action in defiance of the employer's wishes that it also meant to include concerted refusal by the employee's even though the employer was acquiescing in that action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.470" offset="5161796">Now, the further argument is made that the hot cargo clause which purports to excuse the employees from handling -- from handling these goods in effect removes -- removes the handling of these goods from the course of their employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.436" offset="5229714">And the element of the statute that we're concerned with now says concerted refusal in the course of their employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.481" offset="5249881">So the argument is made that the handling of these goods by virtue of the hot cargo clause has been removed from the course of the employer's employment and therefore, this element is missing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.671" offset="5290632">Now, I suggest, Your Honors, that this is a rather artificial interpretation of the phrase and the course of employment as it appears in our statute and that it suggest that goods are within or without the employer's course of employment depending upon one day they may be fair or another day they may be unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.042" offset="5368163">The simple fact is that Congress included the words in the course of employment in this statute to distinguish between refusals by employees as employees to handle this favored goods and refusal by employees as members of the consuming public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.878" offset="5443500">As members of consuming public to not to -- not to patronize -- not to patronize this favored employers or purchase their goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.513" offset="5481953">And that this phrase is -- was not intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.146" offset="5496581">It's a rather artificial construction seems to us to say that in hot cargo clause removes the handling of freight which is normally their business, normally their business that it removes it from their course of their employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.006" offset="5547990">Now, finally, I come to the third element.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.263" offset="5561051">The third element of the violation and that is the forcing or requiring of any employer or the person to cease doing business with someone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.884" offset="5603474">The Union's referring to the statute -- again, once more, the statute says that it shall be an unfair labor practice to induce or encourage the employer's of any employer to engage in the sympathetic strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.024" offset="5668049">Then down to subparagraph (a) on page 66-4A where an object their obvious forcing or requiring any employer or self-employed -- skipped a couple of lines -- forcing or requiring any employer or other person to cease using, selling, handling, transporting or otherwise doing business with any other person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.889" offset="5755507">Now, the unions would have the phrase in subparagraph (4) (A) forcing or requiring any employer or other person to meet that employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.569" offset="5794273">That is the employer -- the media secondary employer whose employees are out -- are engaging in this sympathetic work stoppage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.053" offset="5832202">Now, the statute -- the statutory phrase is not limited that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.670" offset="5850593">It says forcing or requiring any employer or other person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.297" offset="5869087">We think the phrase is broad enough to cover not only the immediate secondary employer -- not only the immediate secondary employer, but also other employers who will be forced or required to cease doing business with some other employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.732" offset="5930841">There certainly is no reason, certainly we're not required to read that phrase as narrowly as the unions -- as the unions are suggesting in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.591" offset="5966263">And let me illustrate what I mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.490" offset="5977861">In the case which follows this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.948" offset="5987788">The secondary employer whose employees were refusing to do, handle certain work on certain nonunion doors, in turn purchased these doors from a local intermediate -- from a local distributor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.114" offset="6044421">The local distributor in turn purchased them from the manufacturer who is nonunion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.319" offset="6065215">Now, while it might be said that the immediate secondary employer who was party to the hot cargo agreement was not being forced or required -- not being forced or required to cease doing business with anybody since he had presumably consented in advance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.928" offset="6123624">Though concerted refusal by his employees would force the intermediate -- the intermediate local distributor to cease doing business not only with the contractor of this action, but also with the manufacturer of the doors of the other end and certainly, that intermedia distributor was as much of a neutral person, a distinctive person as Congress saw it as the -- as an immediate secondary employer who was not involved in the dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.205" offset="6236787">And certainly, we think that Congress meant to protect the interest of those employers even though their own employees were not engaging in some strike action, meant to protect their interest and that the statutory phrase, the comprehensive phrase forcing or requiring any employer is satisfied -- is satisfied when you have that kind of a situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1950.812" offset="7803193">I've already indicated that it was designed to protect the interest of secondary and other secondary employers who may be in the middle between the primary employer and the secondary employer whose employees are engaging in a sympathetic strike action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.069" offset="7860245">Further, we think that Congress intended to protect the primary employer, the fellow who is directly involved in a dispute with this union and his employees that intended to protect him also.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.057" offset="7908206">The purpose of this statute was to narrow insofar as possible with few exceptions like Section 8 (b) (4) (B) was to narrow and insofar as possibly the area of industrial warfare to the employer who is immediately involved in dispute and his employers of the union representing his employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.584" offset="7982289">By that token, it seems to us that Congress was concerned not only with protecting the immediate -- the secondary employer, the fellow who is not at all involved in the dispute but also deemed it unfair to the primary employer to subject him to this kind of -- to these secondary pressures in order to compel him to accept the union's -- or yield to the --</text>

            <text syncTime="2060.391" offset="8241528">The proponents of this statute felt that if you permitted the sympathetic strike actions to continue, to go on as they had in the past that there was a very serious danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.806" offset="8279144">Senator Taft expressed this fear that there was a very serious danger that the -- a large segment of the economy would be tied up by the sympathetic strikes of course to the detriment of the public at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.926" offset="8331703">Now, Senator Taft, I think summed up what we have set forth in several pages of our brief, of contemporaneous legislative history, legislative history during the period that this bill was under consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.043" offset="8388127">He summed that up in what I regard as a very up sentence sometime in 1949 during the course of committee hearings on administration proposals to repeal the secondary boycott provisions of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.209" offset="8448836">And I -- in order to avoid any suggestion that I'm using post legislative history, let me say that first of all, this is Senator Taft who I think can be said to speak with some degree of assurance as to what the statute was intended and finally that all that this sentence does and I'm about to read to simply summarize very handily in one sentence what we have set forth over three or four pages of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.273" offset="8553012">I'll be through in just a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.246" offset="8564924">He said, speaking of the hot cargo, the secondary -- rather speaking the secondary boycotts and what he thought the statute -- the evil that this statute was designed to reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.340" offset="8609332">He said it is it, the secondary boycott is certainly is an attack and it hits right and left any number of people and the public who haven't got the slightest interest in the dispute and does them serious financial damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.454" offset="8665757">Now, I think if we have a right to propose, if we have right in these considerations, it seems to us that it's unrealistic suppose that Congress meant intended a private party, a private party to deprive these other interest, the interest of the public, the interest of other secondary employers, the interest of the primary employer to deprive them of the protection of this statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2208.626" offset="8834403">Fundamentally -- fundamentally, Your Honor, the argument which I've made here, this case happens to involve common carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.284" offset="8861048">The argument which I have made here is substantially the argument which we also make in connection with non-common carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.804" offset="8887171">There is this additional element that has been introduced by the Board's decision in the Genuine Parts case which came down after this -- after this cases came to this Court and which we have apprehended to our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.657" offset="8946625">In the Genuine Parts case which also involved a common carrier, a majority of the Board took the position that these contracts are against -- are invalid to begin with, are invalid to begin with and that therefore they cannot serve to justify the union's action, remove the union's action from the reach of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.692" offset="9034710">Now, two of those members -- two of the members at majority felt that that because of the obligation on common carriers to service all shippers without discrimination that the common carrier couldn't enter this kind of agreement, the third member of the majority has concluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.030" offset="9104091">He concluded in these cases as well as in Genuine Parts that these contracts generally are against the policy of the statute and although the statute does reach them so that we can prevent their execution or compel their decision, that nevertheless, they are against the policy of the statute and that they employ the unions no protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.063" offset="9184235">Now, that as I say, is the view of one member at this majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.763" offset="9198968">Now, let me say in -- in connection with that that recently, the ICC has had the question of the effect of these hot cargo clauses upon the shippers obligation, upon the carriers obligation to a shipper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.838" offset="9271275">And in that case, which we have referred to in our -- in our brief, the Interstate Commerce Commission held that these hot cargo clauses cannot serve to excuse the carrier from his obligation with respect to shippers, to serve -- to serve shippers and the situation there was somewhat like the situation that we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.793" offset="9355076">Now, one of the bases of the arguments that the union's can engage in this kind conduct is that the employer -- it is not unlawful for the employer and the union to get together and for the employer to say, "I will not deal with so and so."</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.215" offset="9420800">Now, at least with respect to common carriers on the basis of the ICC's decision, that basis of that -- that argument of the union is gone because as the ICC views it, a common carrier is not permitted to relieve himself of his duty to serve shippers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.710" offset="9510766">And as I say but apart from that and I will conclude, apart from that, it seems to us that one of these contracts are legal or not -- or illegal, the hard fact is -- the hard fact is that this statute prohibits union inducement without any qualifications based upon the existence of (Inaudible).</text>

            <text syncTime="2426.049" offset="9704176">We will if time permits get to the ICC aspect of the case, which I don't think is actually involved in this case, but which has been brought in later on in the day.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.129" offset="9752451">First, in respect to the Board's statement of the facts, I think there's one or two things which should be added.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.396" offset="9777528">First, it must be deemed for purposes of this case that the particular hot cargo or struck goods clause, as we prefer to call it, was entered into freely between the carriers here and the union for valid or mutual considerations of some sort in the give and take collective bargaining that the union merely requested first members to take advantage of the terms of the clause that did not coerce them into refusing to handle the goods under the clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.635" offset="9926531">And finally that at least one of the said carriers that's involved in this -- that are involved in this case leeway was perfectly willing to have his employees not unload the American Iron Freight when it came to the dock and made no request that they not unload it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.938" offset="9999673">In other words, he was willing to comply completely with the contract and not repudiate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.689" offset="10030707">I think it might be helpful to the Court in -- in trying to find out just what the Congress thought of this hot cargo or struck goods agreements to know a little bit about the -- their nature and their purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.169" offset="10080653">And we have submitted for the Court's examination a so-called economic -- economic brief which does set forth at some length the function of these agreements, their widespread use not only with the -- in the trucking industry, but in other areas and in addition, the AFLCIO as amicus has filed a brief which in addition to going into the legislative history, deals with further -- with a further economic inquiry into the scope and purpose of the so-called unfair goods or hot cargo goods agreements and industries other than transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.415" offset="10261629">And it's -- you will see there that these agreements have our -- our traditional labor agreement just like the union shall.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.231" offset="10292872">It's an important part of the whole fabric of union protection and the union weapon in their dealings with employers and in their -- taking their part from the economic life of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.842" offset="10351282">There's nothing invidious about these agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.059" offset="10360163">They have many, many constructive purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2636.986" offset="10547931">That is a benefit then for the employer to agree that his employees don't have to assist in the strike at that cut-rate plant or the employer may as often happens gain some sort of a specific confession in the bargaining process in return for which he gives this hot cargo or struck clause agreement, or he may desire to maintain harmony in the plants or finally, he may just do plain in sympathy with the union's position in the strike and agrees that his employees don't have to act in any sort of strike breaking passage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.454" offset="10697770">For the union, the hot goods clause as in struck goods clause has traditionally represented a formalization of their basic -- the basic concept of the entire labor movement, namely the concept of mutual aid and assistance that working people in unions strive wherever possible to assist each other in their labor disputes and try not to act adversely against other unions engaged in a strike situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.734" offset="10822844">And so, these clauses have been traditionally bargained for and are presently contained in agreements, the length and press of this nation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3084.604" offset="12338364">As pointed up by Mr. Justice Harlan, the Board's basic premise in this entire argument here and unless that premise supported this case as Mr. Manoli very honestly admitted, but that premise that supported this case got collapsed, is that Congress intended not to protect under 8 (b) 4, not just to protect the innocent third party neutral who is being struck in an effort to get him to cease dealing with the primary employer that's engaged in the labor dispute or strike somewhere else in which neutral has no power to do anything about the dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.466" offset="12481829">He couldn't settle the dispute, the primary dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.802" offset="12499174">It was not Congress' intention merely to protect that individual against this course of strikes which is the traditional secondary boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.272" offset="12533029">But also, Congress intended and by its language sought to protect the -- any person, now that it goes with that part, any person who might be affected by the refusal to handle which is carried on by the so-called innocent third party neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.089" offset="12616307">In other words, the primary employer as stated by the Board, who is actually engaged in a primary dispute, the Board says that he's being protected somehow.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.632" offset="12654446">The Board says apparently the customers, consumers, any -- I don't know where the language is drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.706" offset="12678792">The Board hasn't attempted to draw a line, but apparently anyone who is affected by that secondary strike or that secondary boycott against the neutral is being -- the Congress has sought to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.424" offset="12741695">And in that premise, it argues of course the invalidity of the hot cargo as such as contrary to the policy of the act and its unenforceability because enforcing it would result in hurting these third-- third parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.859" offset="12803344">And also, the Board argues from the same premise for an expanded interpretation of the language, of the literal language of 8 (b) (4), in a matter which 8 (b) (4) (A) in a matter which I will get to shortly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.593" offset="12866351">So the whole case here will rise and fall on whether either the language of the Act or its legislative history demonstrates inclusively that Congress did intend to protect not just the third party neutral, but everyone that might be affected by -- by this action taken against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.803" offset="12955167">Let's see what the language says first.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.863" offset="12999367">So the language is set forth -- on what page the Board -- page two of the Board's brief, the language 8 (b) (4) (A) is pretty narrowly drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.649" offset="13042521">To examine it, what it does is -- is prescribe first of all the union activity, not employer activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.778" offset="13079092">It doesn't reach any employer activity no matter what its impact may be elsewhere.It only reaches activities of unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.905" offset="13103543">It only reaches a certain type of activity of unions, namely a strike or an inducement to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.263" offset="13161012">Now, what -- what is meant by the term concerted -- concerted refusal, we'll come to shortly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.700" offset="13186717">We say it means a partial strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.799" offset="13195180">It was meant to embrace a partial strike, what you do have in this refusal to handle case, the refusal to handle only a particular product, not all products with a prospect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.573" offset="13230289">But at anyway, it prohibits only a union from engaging number two in a strike or inducing a strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.501" offset="13269995">And three, for the purpose of forcing, and the word forcing is important, of enforcing any employer of the term or other person to cease dealing with someone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.630" offset="13326420">Now, that is pretty narrow language if Congress actually intended to give the broad protections which are contended for by the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.028" offset="13368111">For instance, they could have said after the words "any employer" in the A part of our page 2 there, any employer or other person or any other employer or other person.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.549" offset="13426103">What is meant by term other person, we'll come to shortly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.009" offset="13443971">That was not done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.182" offset="13452643">The struck good or hot cargo agreement as such was not outlawed in so many words as Congress very easily could have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.157" offset="13488588">As pointed out by Mr. Justice Frankfurter, no clause -- no contract as such has been specifically outlawed, but it's significant that when they came to the closed shop or union shop, it was said that at least pretty directly, not in so many words, but in unmistakable language which it had to include the union shop agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.324" offset="13585241">That's Section 8 (a) (3).</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.323" offset="13597257">Congress -- Congress didn't even do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.901" offset="13623589">The phrase "other persons" is what the Board hang its head on primarily, the other phrase other person.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.072" offset="13656189">The court below in the Second Circuit (Inaudible) and the Board prior to this Board in past years has construed that term to mean persons who don't come under the definition of an employer under the Act, which means that they would have to have someone under their hire and thus, it embraces sole proprietors or persons like that who are often secondarily boycott, but who may not have employees and because they don't have employees may not achieve the protection which Congress sought to give all innocent third party neutrals, whether they were actual employers or employees or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.085" offset="13812297">That is what -- what the earlier board construed this section and how the court below has construed it and we think it's perfectly reasonable and sensible construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.780" offset="13851063">The legislative history is not put on this at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.658" offset="13862557">It says nothing about what other person for that particular language was intended to cover.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.735" offset="13882932">But I think we should bear this in mind, surely the evil of the secondary boycott lies not in its impact on other person or on third -- remote third parties, but on the pressure puts on an innocent neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.998" offset="13955971">Because if the real evil is the effect on third parties, consumers, the general public and so on, then any economic action by union, a strike, a straight strike which had wide fold impacts often, depending upon the severity of the strike, that strike should be outlawed too.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.641" offset="14034547">Congress, of course, has not done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.860" offset="14043429">So it's simply isn't consistent or logical to say that Congress must have been concerned with all of these remote third parties or that the evil of the secondary boycott anymore than the evil of any other strike action or economic action by the union, lies in its impact upon remote third parties as distinguished from the immediate -- immediately struck innocent third party neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.911" offset="14159621">Now, getting to the legislative history, I think the most striking feature of that history is this, that although the hot cargo or struck goods clause is in a traditional feature of union -- a traditional matter which union is surviving for many, many years preceding even the Wagner Act and a law they were in widespread used as pointed out by Board and as we point out by the time Taft-Hartley was being considered in 1947, 1946, there's not a single mentioned by any of the legislators, any of the Congressmen or Senators or any of the reports of the hot cargo agreement as such or the struck clause agreement as such, no statement even that we intend by it be forced to outlaw the struck goods agreements which are so widely used and so on which would normally you think appear there if was a congressional purpose actually to outlaw or to limit the enforceability of these agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.461" offset="14441744">But there simply is nothing the legislative history on the hot cargo agreement as such expressed by the legislatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.958" offset="14471732">Now, there is some testimony of course by employer witnesses who protest the hot cargo clause, but that type of testimony is evidence of legislative intent, then I don't know any union activity that you couldn't find a basis for prescription under Taft-Hartley Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.532" offset="14554070">The legislative history is set forth at some short length in our brief, in longer length in the brief filed by the AFLCIO, which I will read, the amicus brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.761" offset="14606942">That legislative history shows conclusively this, that in addition not to even -- in addition not even to having taken off and debated, argued about the hot cargo situation as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.117" offset="14664411">The actual discussion when they were talking about secondary boycotts, all was centered around the strike that is directed against some innocent third party neutral who has nothing to do anything about the primary strike that is drawn in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.804" offset="14727210">All the discussions referred to those to two aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3685.430" offset="14741629">First a strike, the Congress was -- was very much -- I won't say horrified, but they were very much impressed with the evil of an innocent party being subjected to a strike number one and number two, being forced against his will to give up business dealings with someone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3711.655" offset="14846537">That is what Congress was talking about all through these rather general references to secondary boycott, determine itself to mean a thousand things as both of our briefs point out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3722.240" offset="14888960">But the actual discussion centered around the strike situation and against a particular neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="3728.054" offset="14912157">There was not talk about the public generally or other third parties other than the neutral, except in a very limited way, in a very incidental way.</text>

            <text syncTime="3822.807" offset="15291141">So, this entire lack of discussion and arguments about the hot cargo clause as such and the limitation of the discussion to the evil of a neutral being heard indicates we say and you'll read the numerous excerpts there, I think you will agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3841.487" offset="15365851">Indicate that Congress intended actually to get out to protect only that innocent third party neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="3848.267" offset="15393019">That's a traditional concept of a -- of a secondary boycott, that a fourth or third party out here that has no interest in the dispute is being attacked by a strike or something.</text>
            <text syncTime="3859.938" offset="15439726">And the -- the sympathy goes to him and Congress, legislated to protect him and it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3865.118" offset="15460415">But it didn't seek anymore than it's out in the primary strike situation to protect all persons who might be affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3875.240" offset="15500957">Now, even more revealing than what Congress said in the debates and whatnot or what its language says, I think is what Congress has specifically refrained from doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3887.567" offset="15550171">First of all, it refrained in the House version of the bill, the plan became 8 (b) (4), to outlaw threats against -- threats of strike action against the neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="3899.261" offset="15596983">There was only actual strikes against the neutral which were outlawed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3903.501" offset="15613910">So that, therefore, the law is today held by many circuits that a union has a right to threaten a neutral with a strike in order to force that neutral not to do business with someone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3917.345" offset="15669290">That's perfectly -- perfectly permissible today and the Board grants it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3922.802" offset="15691128">Congress failed to outlaw that type of threat which certainly doesn't indicate any great concern for the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="3932.411" offset="15729580">The second and more important, if refused specifically to pass specific legislation introduced in the 83rd and 84th Congress designed to outlaw the hot cargo or struck goods agreement in so many words.</text>
            <text syncTime="3949.812" offset="15799171">Senator Schoeppel in 19 -- in the 83rd Congress and Senator Curtis in the Congress before the present one, introduced bills and argued strongly against the evils and so-called or they can see them of hot cargo agreements, but these bills were rejected.</text>

            <text syncTime="3989.777" offset="15959040">It's a pretty strong indication that Congress couldn't have been so worried about these protections of third parties that might be affected or even about the outlawing of the hot cargo agreement itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4004.582" offset="16018286">In addition to all that, these questions can -- the Board hasn't yet answered.</text>
            <text syncTime="4011.377" offset="16045453">If Congress was so concerned with the public, the general public or third parties who might be affected and not just the direct innocent third party neutral that they were so concerned, that Congress was so concerned with that that the Board argues.</text>
            <text syncTime="4025.525" offset="16102087">Why didn't it outlaw consumer boycotts of the innocent third parties?</text>
            <text syncTime="4029.134" offset="16116506">Those are perfectly legal under Taft-Hartley.</text>
            <text syncTime="4032.397" offset="16129567">Why didn't it outlaw the voluntary action of a neutral in refusing to deal with someone else which has impacts -- which might have the same exact impacts as an involuntary refusal as far as third parties are concerned?Why did Congress in 8 (b) (4) permit even direct strikes against neutrals in the situation where they were trying to get to the neutral to bring pressure on the primary employer who has refused to recognize a certified union.</text>
            <text syncTime="4063.851" offset="16255373">That of course has the same impacts on the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="4069.134" offset="16276480">Why did Congress permit employee -- permit union and employers to write clauses in their agreements which would permit -- which would -- which would prevent the employer from requiring his employee's to cross picket line.</text>
            <text syncTime="4087.285" offset="16349100">The Board -- the 8 (b) (4) or the proviso to 8 (b) (4) does that and this Court in the Rockaway News case that's set forth -- mentioned in our brief specifically said that this type of agreement which is closely akin to the struck goods agree -- agreement are perfectly valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="4106.589" offset="16426318">And finally, what are we gonna do about the anomalus situation that's created under the 301 when the union seeks -- when an employer refuses and the Board says, "We have no right to go to our employees and say refuse to comply with the hot cargo clause."</text>
            <text syncTime="4121.265" offset="16485042">And the Board says, "We can't go to our employees and tell them to comply with the clause."</text>
            <text syncTime="4126.662" offset="16506567">Then we go into court and seek specific enforcement under -- under 301, Section 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="4133.287" offset="16533107">The Board in its own brief suggested that that is a possible remedy when we said, "What happened to our contract?"</text>
            <text syncTime="4138.836" offset="16555259">The Board says, "Well, one of your remedies is to go to Court."</text>
            <text syncTime="4144.455" offset="16577724">Supposing we got our specific performance, of course, the impact on third parties is exactly the same as in our -- in the first instance the employees had refused to handle.</text>
            <text syncTime="4153.779" offset="16615027">So again, this whole business of -- in attempt, object to protect parties, third parties indirectly affected parties other than the immediately struck neutral, we say is simply without support in the language of the act, its legislative history and logic and common sense or any other premise.</text>

            <text syncTime="4389.528" offset="17558047">Now, let's -- so much for the general -- what the general congressional purpose was or should be considered in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4399.767" offset="17599007">Let's apply the language of 8 (b) (4) to the facts of this case and see how we come out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4408.681" offset="17634638">The Board has argued for the way they expanded reading of 8 (b) (4) under which any union inducements, whether it was in the nature of a strike or not of its members to refuse to handle trades, is a literal violation of Section 8 (b) (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="4428.324" offset="17713215">And it reaches -- it argues for this expanded reading on the assumption that is the congressional purpose to protect third parties other than the neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="4438.558" offset="17754175">Because if you didn't -- because in order to achieve that purpose, you've got to read -- to read the 8 (b) (4) in the expanded fashion that argues.</text>
            <text syncTime="4448.251" offset="17792940">Now, and it says therefore that even -- that even though the employer repudiates the agreement, still, the union can enforce, and that is this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4463.044" offset="17852082">Let's consider first the implications of that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4466.413" offset="17865561">Apparently, the Board would permit and in fact encourage employers to repudiate valid commitments that are made in the give and take of collective bargaining where concessions are made back and forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="4481.490" offset="17925956">We know that these agreements aren't reached in a day.</text>
            <text syncTime="4484.515" offset="17937972">Each clause represents a concession from one side or the other that the employer has the right to repudiate these agreements and go gus merry way leaving the unions and whatever other remedies it might have, which it -- which at best are impractical as suggested by the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="4502.450" offset="18009757">It does this in the face of a specific policy in the Act to encourage the making of collective agreements and to protect these agreements when made and to provide means for the enforcement of these agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="4515.934" offset="18063673">The whole bend of the act is towards encouraging unions and employers to get together and make collective agreements in each of the acceptable terms and then to see to it that these collective agreements are enforced, to say it at least, it's shocking to hear anyone suggest that a party is free to repudiate an agreement solemnly made for good considerations and we don't know how we can assume a very valuable considerations here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4543.912" offset="18175582">It's even more shocking for the Labor Board as the guardian of the Labor Management Relations to make that suggestion in the labor management field where if anywhere it's applied over the mutual promises be -- of the parties be respected.</text>
            <text syncTime="4563.158" offset="18252591">The court below was shocked with this -- with this position of the Board, the Second Circuit in (Inaudible) was and for the centers Murdock Peterson were much shocked.</text>

            <text syncTime="4608.619" offset="18434403">First of all, Section 8 (b) (4) (A) requires that the union has engaged in a strike or an inducement to strike or -- or engaged in a concerted refusal to do work.</text>
            <text syncTime="4626.811" offset="18507233">Now, obviously, we have not a strike situation here when the employer has consented in advance that not only shall not the employees be required to handle American Iron Freight, but they shall not be allowed to.</text>
            <text syncTime="4637.221" offset="18548820">The Board doesn't argue that we haven't got -- that that element is not here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4640.626" offset="18562403">We haven't got a strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="4642.066" offset="18568255">The union has not induced a strike in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4644.574" offset="18578286">The Board says, however, we have induced some sort of a literal concerted refusal going out and taking the word refusal in its very literal sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="4655.690" offset="18622694">Well, now, we state and it's been -- it's found support in prior decisions of the Board here and in the decisions of the Second Circuit in (Inaudible) and the court below that the term concerted refusal was used by Congress to include something which might be less than a strike as commonly understood, a partial strike, and was used to -- in order to get at this very situation here where in the absence of a -- of a hot cargo agreement, employees may -- or union may go to a employer, a neutral third party neutral and order those employees of that third party neutral not to handle just a particular -- a piece of freight that came in whereas, during the rest of the day, they were free to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="4712.079" offset="18848287">Now, maybe that wouldn't constitute a strike, like in the present case of which we have no hot cargo agreement here at all or no struck goods agreement and the union had forced its employees -- had told its employees, its members there, "Don't handle American Iron Freight, but handle all the rest of the freight that comes in, or else when American Iron Freight comes in, go do something else."</text>
            <text syncTime="4734.824" offset="18939193">In other words, work all day long so you don't engage in a strike, but don't handle American Iron Freight.</text>
            <text syncTime="4741.059" offset="18964167">Now, that situation wasn't perhaps embraced by the word strike, so Congress used the phrase concerted refusal to handle -- to take care of that very situation and not all of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4754.665" offset="19018606">It cannot mean any literal refusal to handle except on the premise of the Board that you're out to protect the entire -- all members of the public, not just the neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="4771.020" offset="19084016">There could be no refusal or partial refusal or partial strike here, which involves the element of insubordination when the employer as here has consented in advance to this very activity, and it's actually stated that the employees shall not be allowed to handle American Iron Freight when it appears (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="4791.727" offset="19166877">So there is no -- that first element is simply added in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4795.275" offset="19181087">The second element is that the refusal to handle had to be done in the course of the employee's employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4803.617" offset="19214420">The word in the course of employment, the phrase is used in 8 (b) (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="4811.771" offset="19247020">We say that means and it must mean this that Congress wanted to make sure that any strike or insubordination or disobedience of orders to work made by the employer was a proper order, namely was one made in the course of the employees employment and the Board put this phrase in, which it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="4836.987" offset="19347853">The Board prior to 1952 construed the phrase course of employment to mean just that and it meant just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4845.985" offset="19383902">The Second Circuit since the Conway case way back in 1949 -- since 1949, the Circuit Court considered the problem -- have adopted that meaning of the word course of employment other than the Ninth circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4868.855" offset="19475331">The Board says -- this phrase and course of employment was to -- was meant to make clear that they didn't want to get after boycotting activities of employees, done by employees in their capacity as consumers, but that would be superpose the purpose the act merely interdicts employees from doing something.</text>
            <text syncTime="4888.329" offset="19553280">And if they aren't employees, then no need to worry about what to do in their consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4892.957" offset="19571775">So we say the only logical meaning to the phrase in the course of employment was to tighten down what acts of disobedience to orders meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4904.209" offset="19616810">Here, of course, the work of handling American Iron Freight was not part of the employments, duties of the particular employees here because it has been specifically taken out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4918.191" offset="19672712">In fact, the clause said that employees shall not be allowed much stronger than to not be required, shall not be allowed to handle American Iron Freight.</text>
            <text syncTime="4927.668" offset="19710642">Therefore, we insist that the second elements of an 8 (b) (4) violation does not exist here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4934.002" offset="19735928">I may point out that the Board's insistence that the parties do not have a right to try to define their own terms of employment, which is traditionally done in collective bargaining agreements, applies directly to the face of this Court's admonition to the Board in the American Insurance case where it says it's none of the Board's business, what the -- what the substantive terms of the agreement are and particularly the scope of the employment's relationship, which was involved in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4964.057" offset="19856196">It's traditional for union, for instance, to put in their contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4970.097" offset="19880333">Employers do agree that foremen can't do the work of non-supervisory employees or vice versa or in the case of female employees, they don't have to do certain types of heavy work.</text>
            <text syncTime="4983.096" offset="19932369">Now, certainly, that sort of opposes in the contract and the union told its members to observe it that would never consider the secondary boycott, and we have the same type of clause here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4995.106" offset="19980330">For instance, in this very case here, one of the freight that came up from American Iron was this little light packages, and the employer told its office personnel, girls or otherwise who were represented by some other union to go ahead and unload that -- those packages because our dock people won't and the union told them not to unload, their union, the Office Workers Union told them not to unload.</text>
            <text syncTime="5021.350" offset="20085342">That would be considered to be a violation, clearly not because that is not worth that in the course of the employment of those office workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5029.717" offset="20118779">And in our case, it simply is not part of the employments relationship or the usual expected job of the dock hence that they unload struck goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="5043.566" offset="20174263">Spelled out long in advance of any strike, long in advance of any labor difficulties and clearly understood by both parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="5050.360" offset="20201430">That they -- when that situation arose, their job did not require them to unload that particular freight.</text>
            <text syncTime="5060.270" offset="20241032">The third element of an 8 (b) (4) violation is that the strike --</text>
