        <section startTime="0" stopTime="1052.792">
          <heading>Argument of I. H. Wachtel</heading>
          <turn speaker="i_h_wachtel" startTime="0.000" stopTime="312.210">
            <label>Mr. I. H. Wachtel</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">Chief Justice, prior to the recess, I had set forth the historical basis for our view that this agency was a legislative and judicial body.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.455" offset="113789">I'm aware of the language of this Court and other tribunals the use of the term quasi, quasi legislative, the quasi-judicial, the tendency to label.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.755" offset="175020">I suggest that the Court -- that War Claims Commission in this case was truly an offspring of the legislative -- legislature performing its functions, performing duties traditionally those of the Congress, performing in the cause with those activities functions of a judicial character.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.306" offset="297169">In the Humphrey's case, this Court had held that -- that Congress had us an appropriate incident of its power, the power to fix the period during which they shall continue and to forbid their removal except for cause in the meantime.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.190" offset="388702">In all respects, we suggest to the Court that the agency here is far more, if I may use the term a quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial agency then in the Federal Trade Commission situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.227" offset="460904">We think the sole distinction in this case, not in the Federal Trade Commission case, the Humphrey's case was that in the Humphrey's case Congress fixed the term -- they fixed the term here.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.496" offset="517956">But in the Humphrey's case it enumerated certain causes for removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.501" offset="545959">In the instant case, the statute is completely silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.814" offset="563200">It enumerates no causes for removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.523" offset="578038">We say -- we suggest to this Court that in this case, it's evident and it should be considered evident that Congress intended that there'd be no power of removal in the present.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.765" offset="647001">The lesson we feel that must be learned of the Humphrey case teaches us is that the President has no inherent power, no implied power over this type of agency by virtue of the vesting of the power of appointment in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.985" offset="735922">We feel that he has over such agencies only such power as Congress gives him because if as this Court said he does not possess an illimitable power.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.139" offset="796526">In order to possess any power, it must come from some place.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.630" offset="818469">It cannot come solely from the vesting of the power of appointment because Congress could easily have vested the power of appointment in the head of the department.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.567" offset="866220">We say that the mere vesting of the appointment does not imply the power to remove because the whole concept of the implied power of removal was its necessity, the need for it for the President to carry out his duties and obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.585" offset="950335">But the duties and obligations other than those fixed in the Constitution that the President possesses what Congress gives him.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.635" offset="986488">I suggest the -- to the Court that this isn't a case of Congress limiting or failing to limit power.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.494" offset="1021910">That in this area in dealing and creating this type of agencies, what Congress does is fix the conditions under which this agency shall operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.469" offset="1073842">It fixes the conditions under which the President may impinge on the functions of this agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.007" offset="1111980">The sole power given to the President was the power to nominate and with the advice and consent of the Senate appoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.352" offset="1153358">Having performed that duty, this agency under the basic concept of the functions and separation of power was to remain free and unhampered by any action or activity of the President in performing truly legislative and judicial powers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1055.312" offset="4221179">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.007" offset="4264020">The only addition that the Government would like to make to the statement of the case made by counsel for the petitioner is that the Court of Claims made it very clear in its judgment that it was not satisfied to all that there would be no power to remove this petitioner that it found that there was no intent on the part of Congress to interfere with the presidential power and that it could not delete that it was Congress' purpose or intent in connection with this legislation that the only resort should be to the cumbersome and very difficult and unusual procedure of impeachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.831" offset="4459311">And therefore, although the Court of Claims concluded that the function of this Commission was both legislative and judicial with which conclusion the Government disagrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.618" offset="4514377">It held that the petitioner could be removed by the President because there was no intent on the part of Congress to leave this -- this man without any control in connection with this work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.739" offset="4570906">On the question of what power is in the President seems to us resolves around the question of the character of the functions of the office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.403" offset="4613538">The Myers case holds up an executive office in general terms that the President has a power that cannot be interfered with to remove.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.583" offset="4650318">And the Humphrey case holds that if the functions are legislative and judicial and if the Congress has made it clear that it intends that there'd be no interference by the executive by the President in the removal that -- the removal cannot be made except in accordance with the terms defined by the Congress in the legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.748" offset="4750942">And you recall in that legislation they found that there wasn't desired by the Congress to have this Commission be independent, that it was made bipartisan, that it was to exercise chancery functions like a court and carry out some of the legislative process in making rules and regulations and because of all of these various things that the Congress had clearly indicated its intention and purpose and also by providing express provisions on the ground of negligence and failure to malfeasance, properly carry out the acts of the office and the three grounds prescribed that the Congress had shown that it should not -- the President should not have the power of removal except as defined expressly in the Act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.075" offset="4988238">In the Ruberoid case, this Court in a dissenting opinion by Mr. Justice Jackson which was not disagreed with in this particular by the rest of the Court wing into at some length as to what is the nature of administrative body that is carrying on a legislative function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.011" offset="5083951">And in that opinion, he develops a considerable length, the fact that in such -- in carrying on such a function, Congress generally lays down a statute which is more or less in skeleton form and it -- you might say it's the high spots that describes the general provisions and then it oppose upon the administrative body the duty to try to define and go into detail as to the application by rules and regulations that are developed under that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.172" offset="5228669">And that is the nature of the function that the Federal Trade Commission in a case that's just been illustrated before the Court before this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.424" offset="5265659">Now, in regard to the judicial or quasi-judicial functions of such an administrative body, we think that in this kind of a problem, we are getting into the question of the separation of powers and is where the administrative body is exercising the function under Article 3, that is the judicial function of the courts that this Court has said that there could not be a removal because in that area the administrative body is carrying on a decision and judgment, a feature that is the very nature of the principles of separation of powers should not be under the control and dictate of the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.578" offset="5482266">Now, if we examine the statute to see what kind of authority this Commission had, we find that the statute gave the petitioner full guidance that he did not have to implement the statutory standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.103" offset="5548408">He did not have to have a skeleton statute but he had clearly defined provisions in the statute which told him just how he was to decide about these claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.543" offset="5590100">And by the way, this was a fund that was developed out of the Trading with the Enemy Act which was amended from time to time but was passed during the first World War in regard to enemy assets and large number of assets of both the Japanese and Germans had been taken over and it was estimated by the courts to Congress that they -- this fund amounted to some $300 million that was going to be disposed of depending upon the amount of the claims by these Commissioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.676" offset="5734609">So, it was a task that had a great deal of responsibility and the country had very genuine and great interest in its proper administration.</text>

            <text syncTime="3676.683" offset="14706730">I don't mean to be suspicious about a very important case like this, but I might say to the Court that some 75 or a 100 regular practitioners in the Court of Claims would like very much to know that this is the position the Government takes on res adjudicata, because scores -- scores, literally scores of paid cases in the Court of Claims determined in the Courts, the District Courts in favor of an employee of being re-litigated in the Court of Claims on the very question of the first right to remove him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3724.273" offset="14897006">And if the Government is right that this is res adjudicata, then I can say that every case where the Government has won in the District Court and the District Court has upheld the right to discharge that all of these people are going to lose their cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3755.491" offset="15021871">Because in the Court of Claims today, the Government takes the position that in the District Court proceedings, the United States of America is not a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3770.142" offset="15080490">I hesitated before to render a judgment in response to an inquiry from Mr. Justice Frankfurter, but if we are going to continue to maintain the fiction that when a suit was brought against Mr. Sawyer, the Secretary of Commerce is -- was in the Steel case, that it was not a suit against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3792.865" offset="15171396">It was going to follow the concepts that we did in Lukens Steel and Larson versus foreign and domestic commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3799.651" offset="15198563">But these are suits against an individual for failure to comply with the law and these suits are not binding on the United States of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="3809.998" offset="15239941">This is the position this Court has taken and it's a position which the Department of Justice takes consistently in the Court of Claims that every time a veteran, a Government employee is successful in the District Court, the District Court has no authority to order him back to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3835.510" offset="15342028">All it can say, he was improperly removed, failure to comply perhaps with the Veteran's Preference Act or any one of a number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3843.651" offset="15374524">When that employee wins in the District Court, he knows inevitably he can't get back on the payroll, but all he can do is now go into the Court of Claims and get a judgment for X dollars from that time on until the date of judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3861.656" offset="15446622">And the Government has regularly as it did in this case, as it does all the time come into the Court of Claims and take the position, “We were not a party to the suit in the District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="4097.129" offset="16388493">It's careful on cases that come up that are dismissed from a -- mootness in the case of death or things of that sort, to send it back to the District Court with specific instructions to dismiss finally so that this problem of mootness does not come up.</text>
            <text syncTime="4114.353" offset="16457352">But here, I think there's a more important question than the -- the strict question of res adjudicata, to have this type of a question raised at this late stage and have a determination made on a matter that I suggest to Your Honors a cursory reading of the docket at the Court of Claims will show pay case after pay case where the Government comes in and says, “We're not bound by that.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4148.792" offset="16595069">And it may not surprise Your Honors that most times when they do re-litigate the question in at least two cases in the Levee case and in the O'Brien case when the Government re-litigated the question in the Court of Claims, the favorable decision of the District Court was in fact reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4170.617" offset="16682423">And an employee who came to the Court of Claims thinking he had nothing more to do than what we call a 39 (c) proceeding to determine how much salary was coming to him finds himself confronted with the defense that his discharge was proper or that there was good cause for it and he losses this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4190.952" offset="16763716">That is precisely what happened to the O'Brien case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4193.621" offset="16774478">This is to those who practice in the Court of Claims, the leading case in the Court of Claims on this subject that we don't have res adjudicata when we bring an action in the District Court and if successful and then go to the Court of Claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="4517.786" offset="18071092">Certainly, the impeachment procedure is cumbersome.</text>
            <text syncTime="4521.496" offset="18085930">Certainly, the procedure of having Congress enact laws and giving the President the right to veto them, there are more efficient ways to adopt laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="4529.685" offset="18118740">There are more efficient ways to enforce crime, but this is not the issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4536.674" offset="18146638">I suggest to the Court that the question is not what is the most expeditious way to remove these people, but what is the best way of keeping the three great departments separate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4548.490" offset="18193868">Truly, there may be arguments made that -- and we hear them from time to time in recent years that some of our judges should be removed or some of our courts should be eliminated that we might perhaps run our Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="4564.833" offset="18259278">We might uncover subversives and criminals and put the dope addicts in jail with much more dispatch, but that isn't the question.</text>

            <text syncTime="4589.464" offset="18357812">It doesn't handle them incidentally the way the Secretary of the Treasury might if Congress delegated it to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="4597.238" offset="18388950">If the Secretary of Treasury were to exercise one of these functions, this would be incidental to its other functions, but it isn't the Secretary that makes Section 8 reports.</text>

            <text syncTime="4674.487" offset="18697927">What we wanted to do is to get this case out of the Court of Claims -- out of the Court of Appeals because under 28 U.S.C. 1500, you can't bring an action in the Court of Claims while there's another action pending in another Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="4745.734" offset="18982870">All I can relate is what I was told about it when I inquired about the difference between this being a equitable estoppel and the collateral estoppel and res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="4762.903" offset="19051520">And res judicata would dispose of the cause while the equitable or collateral estoppel might very well not dispose of the entire rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4777.724" offset="19110870">The problem is that they're asking for reinstatement in the District Court, as I understand the procedure, I handled those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4789.410" offset="19157577">And that is an independent right that they have under the law whether they later sue for amount of salary or wages during the interim or not and if they're denied the reinstatement, they might still obtain the payment depending upon the action which is not the same action.</text>
            <text syncTime="4814.878" offset="19259455">It's an independent right that is -- has been denied them, they claim in the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="4821.366" offset="19285368">So, res judicata would be if it was exactly the same right is being demanded in both Courts then the proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="4841.710" offset="19366766">I'm advised by Mr. Davis who has worked for this matter that the Court of Claims has held there is no res judicata and we have acquiesced in that position of the Court of Claims.</text>
