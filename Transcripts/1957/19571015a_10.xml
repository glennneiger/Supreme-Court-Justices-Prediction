            <text syncTime="11.012" offset="43990">Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.463" offset="57783">This is a companion case to the preceding case, the Lawn case which was argued yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.814" offset="91220">Mr. Striker who represented Mr. Lawn also represented these two petitioners at the trial at the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.082" offset="132284">Giglio and Livorsi, were found guilty on each count in which they were named as the defendants of a ten-count indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.481" offset="173871">The indictment and substance charged violations of the 1939 Internal Revenue Code relating to the year 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.461" offset="217757">Giglio was named as a defendant in eight counts and Livorsi in four counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.128" offset="244506">Each of the petitioners was sentenced to a total term of 15 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.150" offset="272509">I would like first to address myself as to whether the defendants were wrongfully deprived of an opportunity to ascertain whether tainted evidence was used against them at the trial or in order to indict.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.540" offset="358087">In 1950, three years before the present indictment was filed, three informations were filed charging the petitioners and Mr. Lawn with violations of the internal revenue laws pertaining to the year 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.292" offset="445127">The defendants pleaded not guilty to those informations.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.813" offset="467174">The case was later marked off the trial calendar and the investigation by the internal revenue agents was continuing.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.513" offset="506044">In 1952, about July, while this case was still pending, while these men were still defendants in a criminal income tax prosecution, the petitioners were subpoenaed to appear before the Grand Jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.550" offset="582113">When Mr. Livorsi appeared there, he was not advised by the government as to any constitutional rights he had, as to whether or not he could be brought before the Grand Jury or whether or not he might refuse to answer any questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.354" offset="653375">When the petitioner Giglio was brought before the Grand Jury, he on 12 occasions asserted his constitutional privilege against self incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.601" offset="706351">He was then brought before District Judge T Hyot Davis and the assistant asked that he be held in contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.006" offset="752013">At that time, I will read just a short part or part of that hearing, it's on page nine of the original brief, “the court asked the Assistant United States Attorney,” I'm quoting from the record at 2824.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.848" offset="819304">The court, “Well he is being investigated himself?”</text>
            <text syncTime="209.752" offset="838949">Mr. Leone, the prosecutor, “These various companies are being investigated Your Honor.”</text>
            <text syncTime="216.703" offset="866743">The court, “The defendant himself is not under investigation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="223.443" offset="893701">Mr. Leone, “Well, it is a John Doe investigation, and the witness appeared in response to a subpoena duces tecum.”</text>
            <text syncTime="233.116" offset="932362">The court, “I see.”</text>
            <text syncTime="234.751" offset="938945">Mr. Leone, “The witness was asked to produce certain records of certain companies and it has been established that he was either a partner in some of these companies or that he was an officer of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.556" offset="994220">Now the investigation is a John Doe proceeding and it might very well be that in time he would be a subject of an investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.382" offset="1033509">I don't say that he is not, but at the present time these companies are under investigation Your Honor.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1863.997" offset="7455974">I believe that Mr. Delaney has outlined clearly the two principle issues before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.673" offset="7486589">I think there maybe some confusion as to first of these.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.859" offset="7503412">First is the alleged denial of an opportunity to establish that tainted was used for the 1953 Grand Jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.851" offset="7543327">Second, is an alleged denial, the opportunity to prove (Inaudible) to the case against them at the trial, which was based on evidence that was allegedly obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.319" offset="7593273">Turning to the first question, I believe Mr. Justice Black's question on that is the government's answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.334" offset="7621277">We believe that they were accorded in the first instance argument and affidavits on that issue, a hearing of a sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.415" offset="7653564">It was not an evidentiary hearing of the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.987" offset="7667879">We believe there was no need for a hearing of any additional time, because no matter what that hearing had shown, indictment valid on its face, of a properly constituted and unbiased Grand Jury would not be subject to dismissal by the fact that among the evidence they had considered, if it were true, was evidence which had been obtained from the defendants in violation of the Fifth Amendment privilege.</text>

            <text syncTime="1999.037" offset="7996082">The Holt case, the unanimous decision of this Court Justice Holmes writing the opinion, in that very case there was evidence obtained from the defendant in violation of the Fifth Amendment privilege, was adjudicated to be that way at the trial court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2044.919" offset="8179670">I will now turn to the principle denial, alleged denial of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.926" offset="8203703">This is based on the Nardone decision (Inaudible), it's applicable to evidence obtained in violation of the Fifth Amendment privilege.</text>

            <text syncTime="2062.697" offset="8250723">It further goes on the theory that since they had established through Judge Carter's decision that there had been some prior violation of their rights, they were at least entitled to some opportunity, however closely confined if I may take the language of Nardone to seek to prove that a substantial portion of the case against them was fruit of that poisonous tree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.866" offset="8359393">Our answer to that is they were accorded due process, full due process, every opportunity that could have been given to them within reason to seek to establish that any evidence at the trial was the fruit of the 1952 Grand Jury proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.749" offset="8442984">Let me run through what they had.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.030" offset="8480078">First, they were provided with all of the allegedly tainted evidence itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.289" offset="8509127">They had the original documents produced before the 1952 Grand Jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.665" offset="8526576">They were provided the transcript of their testimony before that Grand Jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.803" offset="8543190">It was available to them throughout the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.939" offset="8559700">That were thus -- and everything that could have helped them, everything that government could provide them with to help, inspect, trial, record as it developed and compared with the tainted evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.360" offset="8609437">The 1953 Grand Jury minutes which they did not have were immaterial in this regard.</text>

            <text syncTime="2267.665" offset="9070655">For example just the -- they refer to the facts of leads and clue, the thrust of their attack was always the leads and clues used in 1953 indictment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2748.717" offset="10994834">If you turn to page 246, Judge Walsh for whom I've already expressed my great respect says that this is a different position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.341" offset="11049273">This doesn't go to the invalidity of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.373" offset="11061394">In other words he, I think it he means the judge, he is taking about the supression for use at the trial and in any subsequent time will he properly obtain material.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.490" offset="11105907">Mr. Stryker, well the supression of all evidence, I think you're right about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.757" offset="11122939">Then go on the next case, go on the next page, on top of the page, we have not been able to make that inquiry the judge tried to make bringing it again on -- bringing it on in a timely way et cetera, all of that problem is really injected not to any (Inaudible) in this trial, and the very purpose as Your Honor knows so well, that these various motions to suppress evidence and so forth is to prevent confusion at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.160" offset="11236624">So that he isn't restricting himself to the invalidity of the indictment and Judge Walsh didn't and then at the bottom of page 247, 248, it interests me greatly, because of the suggestion I made to Mr. Delaney, hasn't the judge a right to rely on the affidavit of the District Attorney, that's exactly what Judge Walsh says.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.395" offset="11321574">What I would also say, I'm going to deny your motion, not only because Judge Palmieri reached that conclusion, and apparently after considerable stock taking reflection, but I would also say that if I had the problem put before me de novo, and if this United States attorney swore to me, that this testimony had not been presented before the Grand Jury, I would take that affidavit on the basis of my experience with them, since I've been here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.295" offset="11441110">Now it seems to me to raise a very serious question, whether defendants must be foreclosed because of a confidence which I should think a judge rightly should have in the US attorney and assistant US attorney, assurances that there are no clues.</text>

            <text syncTime="3683.530" offset="14734106">We believe that there is nothing suggesting that any of it came from leads and clues and antecedent history spelled out where it came in question.</text>

            <text syncTime="4383.878" offset="17535478">In the record page 1353 the prosecutor characterized the problem as one relating to the admissibility of evidence and called upon defendants to establish a further foundation and requested it be done outside the presence of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="4401.968" offset="17607784">Mr. Stryker pointed out the only way defendant could establish were the leads and clues outstanding, that's on page 1354, from the illegal seizure is through the witness as they are presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="4415.717" offset="17662851">And the prosecutor stated that he did not object at all to counsel inquiring of Mr. Roth, a key witness, about the documents that he saw.</text>
            <text syncTime="4425.909" offset="17703602">The court then stated I don't want to get into their question of documents even though you might have no objection to it, that's at page 1354.</text>
            <text syncTime="4437.759" offset="17750936">Later on at page 1356, the trial judge in most certain terms refused to permit defendant's counsel to interrogate a government witness, Roth again, concerning the prosecutor's use of tainted evidence at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4455.252" offset="17820944">At page 1944 when there was an attempt to cross examine another key witness of the government Mr. Present, the government's accountant, the prosecutor objected the statement.</text>

            <text syncTime="4553.050" offset="18212153">Mr. Stryker; the point was really that we were not able to find out whether those things were improperly obtained or not.</text>

            <label>Mr. Roger D. Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="4892.446" offset="19569685">We read the testimony somewhat differently than Mr. Delaney does.</text>
            <text syncTime="4897.852" offset="19591314">I'd like to point out for example as relates to Mr. Roth, the colloquy and cross examination which I previously referred on 1322, 1323, these stages without objection, without being stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="4916.804" offset="19667174">Mr. Stryker cross examined Mr. Roth as to whether he had appeared before the 1952 Grand Jury, whether he had been asked to produce all the documents he had for the 1952 Grand Jury, whether documents which he had recently produced before the Court, at the government's, next government witnesses were among those which he had brought before the 1952 Grand Jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="4939.936" offset="19759647">He was -- he asked if they were not, that he had not found the document until after the 1952 Grand Jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="4947.234" offset="19788904">As to Mr. Present, he was stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="4950.552" offset="19802175">Mr. Present was a critical government agent who brought all the figures together.</text>
            <text syncTime="4955.564" offset="19822237">He was stopped when the questioning came forward and I think both briefs refer to the references on that, he was stopped when he was asked if he had considered in making an audit other evidence and what evidence, and the prosecutor told the judge, we had no objection to this question, but it was going to lead to fact that Mr. Present had seen documents that had been brought before the 1952 Grand Jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="4986.390" offset="19945535">Mr. Stryker would ask the questions the other way around, as to where the antecedents for everything he had in the record, there will be no exception, but prosecutor was afraid Mr. Stryker would seek to get in the record by his own questioning some of the evidence which the government accepted did not want to get in the record did not want to base the conviction on, and asked if it be done, it would be done outside the presence of the jury and at that point Mr. Present was stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="5016.181" offset="20064653">If he was not stopped when he asked how we got figures, whether the figure, where did you get this, when did that document come, when did the government agent first ask you about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5029.156" offset="20116584">Were your first question about this, May 1951, early 1948, those questions and I can only say that if you look at the references in which we show, given the brief, which explains where the documents came from, you'll find bulk of it is brought out and also we believe there was no limitation on cross examination, find the clue that lead to the piece of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5057.814" offset="20231210">The only time Mr. Present was really shut off, was when he was -- was the judge was afraid he was going to bring in the evidence, tainted evidence before the -- by cross examination, bring it out which would have worried the trial, he wasn't sure the waiver would account for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5073.231" offset="20292859">He was also stopped when he indicated, and we believe that you read any question in context, you will that see Mr. Stryker was directing his questions at what was before the 1953 Grand Jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="5085.793" offset="20343118">He was stopped regularly on that line of inquiry and the primary purpose of his questions throughout is the issue which has now been removed from the case, that is the invalidity of the 1953 indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5098.585" offset="20394318">He was trying to upset the entire case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5101.708" offset="20406753">He was not interested in excluding a particular -- at least he did not demonstrate much interest, excluding a particular item, but again the indictment dismissed and most of the questions which they have referred in their brief are cases where he was questioning now what was before -- Leone the former prosecutor, what did you bring before the 1953 Grand Jury?</text>
