            <text syncTime="55.612" offset="222354">This requirement imposed as a condition for securing the traditional tax exemption which so far as churches are concerned had been accorded in California for over a century and which these petitioners had had dropped their existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.886" offset="307513">In the event, this statute, the text to which of course appears in the appendix to the bringing of opening brief, imposed as a condition for the securing of that exemption that the person-organization make a declaration under oath, the tax person did not advocate the destruction of the Government of California or of any state by force or violence or under -- or rather unlawful means, a phrase not unknown to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.701" offset="446798">But additionally and conjunctively also imposed the requirement that the person declare that he or the organization declare does not advocate the support of a foreign government against the United States in the event of hostility.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.883" offset="531435">A phrase quite new to this Court, indeed my guess is that no justice sitting on this Court has ever had to deal with the meaning of that phrase or it's application.</text>
