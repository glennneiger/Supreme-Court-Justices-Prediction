            <text syncTime="35.508" offset="142002">The first one was the question of Mr. Justice Black as to whether or not the Uniform Code of Military Justice contained a provision similar to the one with respect to conduct on becoming an officer or a gentleman for enlisted personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.285" offset="237087">There is such an article in the Uniform Code of Military Justice, it's the general article, Article 134.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.596" offset="274286">So it seems and as a matter of fact, the case is so whole that an individual who commits a crime while he is a soldier and he gets in trouble with the civilian authorities would be subject to the court-martial jurisdiction under Article 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.553" offset="366132">Equally true is the situation where the enlisted man writes scandalous letters to his commanding officer's wife.</text>

            <text syncTime="230.602" offset="922331">Now, with respect to Army Regulation 615-360, we now see that unless the man has been subject to a general court-martial, unless he has been subject to more than one special court-martial, and if he has ratings of excellent as to character and ratings of excellent as to efficiency, he must receive under 615-360 an honorable discharge with of course the exceptions spelled out in the Army security risk regulation as set up and established by Department of Defense directive 5210.9, which we are challenging here.</text>

            <text syncTime="282.522" offset="1130057">And that question was whether or not our position in this case could be analogized to the situation of an individual who had been fired from government civilian employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.237" offset="1180944">And the question I think was whether or not it was our position that the Secretary of the Army could not make a public statement saying why the individual had been discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.948" offset="1239771">I would agree with that position but that's not this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.382" offset="1261505">An army discharge certificate is not a notification of personnel action which terminates a federal civilian employee from his job.</text>

            <text syncTime="938.717" offset="3754841">To review the issuance, the action of the Army in issuing this man the kind of discharge he was issued on the basic facts of this case as they stand admitted before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.492" offset="3817953">We think that under this Court's holding in Perkins against Elg, even if the District Court had no power to compel the Army to issue the petitioner here an honorable discharge certificate, certainly, we think it had the power to declare invalid or unconstitutional the kind of discharge he did get if the reasons for the action were invalid or unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.468" offset="3945848">Nevertheless, the respondent argues that the legislative history of the statutes providing for the Board -- the Army Discharge Review Board and the Army Board for the Correction of Military Records, demonstrate a congressional intent to preclude judicial review of this kind of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.693" offset="4030694">We disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.908" offset="4035605">We think that the legislative history of the term "final" as used both in Section 301 of the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944 and in 207 of the Legislative Reorganization Act, indicate that Congress did not preclude judicial review of arbitrary or capricious administrative action by the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.727" offset="4130900">Of course, if Congress had said that the administrative determination not only should be final and conclusive but that no court of the United States should have jurisdiction to review such determination, of course, the army's position would be much stronger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.618" offset="4182413">But here, so far as Section 207 is concerned, such words were specifically deleted from the statute by committee amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1062.672" offset="4250645">Now, the second half of the Army's attempt to sidestep what we consider the basic issue here, is the contention that Harmon has not suffered injury to a legally protected right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.848" offset="4307383">The Army says that since the general under honorable conditions discharge entitles Harmon to virtually all federal veterans' benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.299" offset="4337162">He hasn't suffered the kind of injury which would give him the standing to raise the issues he seeks to raise in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.078" offset="4364225">Now, while it's true that the general discharge will not automatically deprive Harmon of federal veterans' benefits, he will be deprived of a number of veterans' benefits provided by the laws of the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.294" offset="4421172">The New York statutes make marked distinction between an honorable discharge and a discharge under honorable conditions and I call the Court's attention specifically to the Education Law of the State of New York and the distinction between Section 609 of the Education Law and Section 608 as it's discussed in our brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="3388.884" offset="13555461">And the test there which the Court has laid down is that if it is conceded that the man is in the military establishment and if it is conceded that the court-martial which tried him was constituted in accordance with law and it had jurisdiction to pass on the offense with which he was charged, that's the end of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.685" offset="13646681">That for considerations of army discipline, the fact that the military establishment is an entirely separate community, as this Court has put it, from the civil community, that -- and for separation of powers consideration that the courts do not at all take the same type of review of military action as they do of course of governmental action which affects civilian rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="3473.639" offset="13894531">Taking all of those things together, we consider that Congress did not intend to make the matter of a man's discharge the kind of a legal right which was proper subject matter for the civil courts to pass on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.055" offset="13980212">Now, Congress has recognized the distinction between the various types of discharges in this sense.</text>

            <text syncTime="3521.432" offset="14085642">In other words, that is a form of punishment imposed upon the soldier where he has been found guilty of a violation of offenses formerly prescribed by the Articles of War and now carried forward into the Uniform Code of Military Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.489" offset="14153874">But on the other hand, the so-called administrative types of discharge, the honorable discharge, the general discharge under honorable conditions and the undesirable discharge, those are not given for the commission of offenses in the same sense at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.290" offset="14261081">They are not given because the man has been found guilty by a court-martial offense, they are given because the army has decided that from the standpoint of the efficient operation of the army, it's better off not to have Private John Jones in the Army.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.824" offset="14311236">Now, the general discharge under honorable conditions which is given here is given for many things which have nothing whatever to do with security considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.311" offset="14369228">It's specifically given, for instance, if the soldier lacks physical stamina.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.206" offset="14392738">It's given if he is psychologically ill-equipped for combat conditions, and many other thing, it is merely a determination of the Army, that although the man has served under honorable conditions for one reason or another and may be wholly beyond his fault or anything that he can correct, the Army is just better off not to have that man in the service.</text>
