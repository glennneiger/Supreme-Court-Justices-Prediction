            <label>Mr. Robert T. McCracken</label>
            <text syncTime="24.762" offset="98952">If the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.069" offset="108251">This case comes here from -- on certiorari in the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit which reversed the District Court, the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and it brings before the Court a question which has been before several Courts of Appeals, and undoubtedly that's the reason that this Court granted certiorari, they have not all agreed upon the inclusion of an insurance policy in a testator's estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.001" offset="247954">The facts of the case are these, this old lady, Mrs. Robert Haines, a resident of Philadelphia at the age of -- in somewhere in the 70s, in 1934 was persuaded to make an investment or rather three investments totalling $350,000 in the face value of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.824" offset="347220">The beneficiaries of which were her four children.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.851" offset="367386">At her age, she could not have obtained this policy without a medical examination, had she not taken out at the same time annuities from the same companies which issued the insurance policies payable to her and non-refundable at her death.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.230" offset="444918">The mathematics of the transaction were such as carefully worked out for the insurance company that the company couldn't lose.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.995" offset="491938">She paid not quite the face value of the policy for the policy but a considerable sum for the annuity which added to the premium that she had for the policy, exceeded the face value of the policy by a substantial amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.860" offset="555363">A similar case came before this Court some 17 years ago, 1941, called Helvering against Le Gierse, and in that case, the sole question presented was, was this insurance of such a nature that it could be deducted to the extent of $40,000 from -- there's a taxable state.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.011" offset="671974">Your Honors, will recall that up to a certain time, the insurance made out to beneficiaries other than the estate was deductible up to the extent of $40,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.715" offset="718785">This Court -- that was the only question presented in that case so stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.605" offset="742400">This Court decided that it was not insurance and Your Honors so decided because you said there was no risk for the very reason that I have just stated, the company saw to it that it got enough money that the time that these two premiums were paid, so that no matter what happens, whether this woman died the day after she took out the policy and they paid the face value of the policy which was more than the face value of the premium on the policy but considerably less than the agreed regular premiums or whether she lived for 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.931" offset="871654">And the surrender value, the cruel value grew all the time on the policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.580" offset="898299">The company just couldn't lose and that additional amount which ran above the face value of the policy was of course to take care of the so-called loaning charges, the agent's commission, the expenses of the -- of the underwriting and the profit of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.692" offset="958694">Now that's what, Your Honors, decided in that case and that's all that was decided and so stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.059" offset="988160">Other cases have since arisen including this one in which what you said there has been taken and reached out to control a situation that was not before you then.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.155" offset="1052526">What you said there was this is not insurance, it is a form of investment using the insurance policy as a medium of investment and as such form of investment, it is subject only to the risks that the ordinary investment is.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.008" offset="1127967">Every case has been decided since has repeated that statement and has stated it to be the law and there's no doubt about it being the law that this is not insurance, yet anything but nomenclature.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.945" offset="1183765">His insurance went out of the case of these series of cases when, Your Honors, decided the Le Gierse case.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.935" offset="1211664">Now, let us take that position totally and I'll go on, what happened in this case was that this old lady, as soon as she took out the insurance policies, assigned them towards her four children, absolutely, irrevocably and they were -- they took possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.897" offset="1295569">And that time on, they received the dividends of the policy which are not large as Your Honors know but there are dividends paid on policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.461" offset="1325767">They also enjoyed the annual accretion of value in the -- the surrender value which is made up in part of dividends.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.907" offset="1371533">She had nothing whatever to do with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.525" offset="1378011">She couldn't have touched the policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.510" offset="1385953">They could've taken those policies out in any year up to the time of her death and surrendered them, and gotten the surrender value, and invested it, and according to a recent case which the tax court has decided from which no appeal was taken and which that exactly happened, the tax court said, why of course this isn't taxable, there's nothing to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.133" offset="1480516">These people have -- have converted this asset and there's nothing to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.004" offset="1499951">They may have spent it to any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.343" offset="1509355">That was the reasoning of the tax court.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.868" offset="1515416">Now she could have -- they could have done that but they didn't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.422" offset="1529626">They left the policies there until her death.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.803" offset="1543210">I represented the executors.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.968" offset="1551778">I represented her for many years and I wish I'd represent too and they brought these policies to her, I wouldn't have let her sign them because I don't like this kind of an investment, I would have demonstrated to, Your Honors in a few moments that it is not a wise investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.924" offset="1603605">But we -- I advised the executors not to include this in the tax return, the state tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.544" offset="1634116">They did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.817" offset="1639236">The Commissioner assessed the deficiency of I think it's a $106,000 and we paid the tax and brought suit for the -- for the refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.391" offset="1681554">The District Court decided in our favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.865" offset="1691376">The Court of Appeals following a decision of the Second Court -- Second Circuit that decided against us and we're here on this conflict of courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.630" offset="1734426">Now, let us take the position, may I please the Court, which of course we must take that this is not in any sense an insurance question.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.021" offset="1784059">Your Honors, took that out of the case in 1941 and it's never been there since.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.535" offset="1810077">That this is a question in which an insurance company was used as a medium or machinery of investment, that's all it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.280" offset="1849051">Now, let me just give Your Honors one or two analogies which occurred to me, always remembering that we're talking about investments.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.265" offset="1884996">Let us suppose that this old lady had gone to a trust wanting to give this $350,000 to her children irrevocably and frankly wanting to get it out of her estate, so that it wouldn't be includable in the -- in the tax which is a very usual and common thing to do, it is not evasion, it's following the rules, she had 12 years so there was no question to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.326" offset="1985202">And I may say that there's no question here on the part of the Government of contemplation of death or something to take effect of death.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.269" offset="2017071">The Government puts -- bases its claim entirely on the section of the Act that says that she retain the income.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.595" offset="2050299">She retained an income and interest in the -- in the property, in the policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.832" offset="2071301">Now, let us suppose, of course she didn't, I'll explain that to Your Honors, she didn't declare at all in this policy, all that she had retained was the annuity which she bought at the same time and which she could have bought at the same price without the policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.795" offset="2131174">No question about that, that's in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.890" offset="2143504">Now, let us suppose she'd come to me and said, "I want to supply $350,000 for my children.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.923" offset="2175687">I want to do it now while I'm alive."</text>
            <text syncTime="547.684" offset="2190733">And suppose I had said to her and she had accepted the advise, go to a trust company and set up a trust for the benefit of your children for life or for your life, the income to be paid to them for your life but giving them the power if you please, by unanimous memorial to the trustee to terminate the trust at any time and get the money which is equivalent to the surrender value of the insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.426" offset="2317688">And then I have said, she accepted the trust company.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.387" offset="2333466">Well, I want them to take this there myself too and here is some more money and I'd like to buy or set up a trust for myself for life, all the income to come to me and on my death to go to my children.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.372" offset="2397414">Now, I take it, Your Honors that of course the second of those trusts would be taxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.379" offset="2413505">She retains the income, nobody disproves that.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.286" offset="2425104">But I take it, Your Honors, that in that set of circumstances, even the Government would not have tried to tax the first of those two trusts and I say that with assurance because I tried exactly such a case, a number of years ago in which a woman who had been -- who curiously enough also had four children and this lady have been giving each of her children their allowance for about $5000 to $6000 a year and she got all the time to pay the taxes on her own income in the high brackets because it cost her $12,000 to $15,000 a piece to pay those children this $5000.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.680" offset="2558642">And somebody advised her, why don't you set up a trust for them and let them pay the tax on their own income from the trust and that's exactly what she did, set up the irrevocable trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.471" offset="2613812">They began to get the income, pay the taxes on it, she lived seven or eight years, or nine years, I forgotten which and died.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.386" offset="2645473">And they attempted -- the Government attempted to tax that -- include that in the estate.</text>

            <text syncTime="676.952" offset="2707749">They of course couldn't do it on this section of the Act because she didn't retain the income.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.201" offset="2728751">Here, they're doing it only on the retention of income, alleged detention of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.021" offset="2744007">They did it on the ground that it was a gift and contemplation death.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.068" offset="2760202">Well, I tried that case before the tax court.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.043" offset="2768144">I asked Your Honors, pardon me, a personal illusion but it's exactly this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.858" offset="2783399">I tried that case before the tax court and I was able to persuade the tax court, not that it was -- that there were -- that it was not delivered in contemplation of death but it was delivered in contemplation of continued life that she got, she wanted to lessen her income tax payments and still give this -- her children a needful amount of money to live on and the tax court decided in my favor and the Government threw up its hands never even appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.898" offset="2883500">Now, therefore, I say with some assurance that in the analogy that I just attempted to give to Your Honors, if she had set up this trust fund, these two funds with the same trust company, on the same day through a one check for the -- if you please for the total amount of money with the both of them or deposit to secure it.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.708" offset="2966779">If she set those up, of course the second of the trust funds in which she retained the income would have been taxable and of course the first would not.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.441" offset="3013695">Now, I say that there isn't an iota of difference between that first type of fund and this insurance policy which was irrevocably assigned to the children and which the children could have taken out any day at all and surrender it for less than its face value but for a very substantial part of its face value and just before her death for almost its exact face value.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.931" offset="3119647">It was their property.</text>

            <text syncTime="819.067" offset="3276173">Now, the Government will come back and say this, all they may say but the trouble is that this woman couldn't get the policy of insurance without taking out the annuity, therefore it was bound to be one investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.134" offset="3328522">Now, let me just stretch my analogy a little further.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.722" offset="3346808">Let us suppose in going to this trust company, she had attempted to set up a small trust first for her children and in my experience, trustees won't always take small trusts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1046.657" offset="4186593">And then he showed her the $50,000 to John Hancock Life Insurance Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.496" offset="4201953">That policy differs in a slight degree because there the assignment was not to the children direct or to a trustee, the Fidelity-Philadelphia for the children but absolute -- absolute irrevocable and they were just to get (Inaudible) children instead of giving it to the children direct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.037" offset="4272065">But at that time, she thought perhaps she gave them enough, but she gave them the 300, so she thought she better put something in trust for it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1253.711" offset="5014779">I think it might help a little bit if we talked about some concrete facts here in terms of the premiums that were paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.326" offset="5053231">There were three insurance policies and three contemporaneous annuity contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.285" offset="5073084">I think it would be easier if we consider that as one insurance policy totalling $350,000 and an annuity which yielded $8000 and some odd dollars per year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.500" offset="5121985">There is no substantial difference between the -- among the three policies, we do not contest the -- any question as to the revocability of the assignments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.181" offset="5164722">The formula for issuing these contracts was that the combined premiums for the insurance and the annuity must equal eleven-tenths of the face value of the insurance policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.981" offset="5219892">This decedent pay for $350,000 worth of insurance, $384,000 -- strictly speaking that should be $385,000, there's a discrepancy of $1000 in one of the policy but we will assume since it makes no substantial difference that it was eleven-tenths.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.512" offset="5302021">She was not required to take any medical examination but the premium for the insurance policy was charged at the regular insurance rates, namely the same rates that would have been charged had she been found medically to be in good health.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.823" offset="5371193">That premium was a combined total of $314,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.578" offset="5402227">The balance of the total required, namely $384,000, was the total allocable to the annuity and by that I mean as the District Court found that she did not have any choice in how much of an annuity she wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.657" offset="5466593">She had to purchase an annuity which cost $70,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.625" offset="5490416">She couldn't say I want an annuity that would yield me only $5000 a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.030" offset="5508075">The transaction worked the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.149" offset="5516539">It worked from the premium end.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.008" offset="5523958">She had to purchase a $70,000 premium annuity, whatever the yield might be and that is exactly what she did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.386" offset="5557499">The reason for this is obvious and in fact it is stated expressly in the findings below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.716" offset="5578815">The company required this in order to protect itself in case she died a short time after the policy issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.555" offset="5610162">If that should happen, the company would always have in hand a sum sufficient to pay the insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.112" offset="5640359">That -- the 10% extra was for loaning charges and commissions as counsel state but even after that, the company always had $350,000 in its possession and was obligated to pay this annuity of $8000 which comes to approximately 2.5% on the investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.003" offset="5735967">That leads us squarely to Helvering versus Le Gierse, which counsel mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.701" offset="5754776">I would like to state at the outset that this Court in Helvering versus Le Gierse did not solely decide that this was not insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.736" offset="5794900">At the last page of Mr. Justice Murphy's opinion, after having reached the conclusion that this was not insurance, he states, we now must consider whether it is taxable and he then said it is taxable under Section 302 (c) of a prior Revenue Act which is the predecessor of Section 811 (c) which is the Section we are now dealing with today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.305" offset="5893120">So this Court in Le Gierse said that this transaction was taxable under the very same Section we are presently concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="2053.668" offset="8214570">And I failed to see how this case differs from a straight trust where the decedent reserves to herself the income for life and hasn't created a con -- a vested remainder in her children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.658" offset="8278622">That life can -- as the court below appropriately noted, has no rights, or title, or legal interest in the remainder created in favor of the children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.721" offset="8322821">The life tenant merely has the income but the two are still interrelated and that certainly is the classic example of the retention of income for life situation which this Court has held taxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.331" offset="8377260">It is interesting also to note that in two states under similar statutes, the same result have been reached similar to those that the Government is now contending.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.040" offset="8420101">Those states are the States of Connecticut and New Jersey where similar combination policies were presented to the Court and a question of a state taxation at both courts held that the two were related, that this was a transfer with the retention of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.960" offset="8491781">I might say also in reference to the Goldstone case that in Goldstone, counsel correctly noted that this Court decided the case upon the ground that the decedent had retained a reversionary interest in the policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.057" offset="8552176">The Court at the end of its opinion states that because of this decision, we need not pass upon the Government's alternative contention, that this is taxable as a transfer with income retained for life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.310" offset="8625215">I would like to point out that we run into a furious situation as a result of this Court's decision in Le Gierse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.234" offset="8656875">It is not taxable as insurance because this Court has said in Le Gierse that these combination contracts are not insurance and if this Court reverses the judgment below, it is not taxable in any other fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.490" offset="8713927">Therefore, we have a perfect device for avoidance of any tax with a -- by a bootstrap of lifting up based upon this Court's decision in Le Gierse which was originally designed to prevent the taxpayer from taking advantage of an insurance exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.940" offset="8795742">Now, as to the surrender value, I would like to add one word.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.283" offset="8809117">I think I have partially covered it when I said that the statute is directed to a period which does not in fact end before death and in fact these policies were never surrendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.327" offset="8861257">In addition to that, however, we need not speculate as to what the situation would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.001" offset="8895948">Counsel has afforded us I think a very good analogy for our purposes in his brief, where he compares the situation to that of a savings bond which you purchase for $900, which -- that reaches its full value of $1000 in 10 or 12 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.648" offset="8966583">And he says, suppose that have been transferred to the children, the children can cash that in at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.068" offset="8996258">But the difference between that case and this case is that in that case, the donor has given only $900 for that bond and the donee never receives less than $900.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.531" offset="9050070">Here, if we take the premium, the decedent paid $314,000 for these three insurance policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.708" offset="9082776">If the children had sought to cash them in shortly after their issuance, they would have received $25,000 less than that amount, and $61,000 less than the face value of the policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.673" offset="9150589">And even in 1938, they would have received $14,000 less than the premium and $50,000 less than the face value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.082" offset="9184235">The cash surrender value never did reach, I must correct counsel on that, never did reach the face value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.930" offset="9207641">Its higher figure was $326,000 which was still $24,000 below the face value of the policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.349" offset="9245362">So that as the court below noted and has quoted from the New Jersey decision in Bank of New York, it is fantastic to assume that what this decedent really meant to do was an out and out transfer of this insurance policy to her children as a present gift.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.224" offset="9324878">What she intended and what everybody to the transaction obviously understood was that this would be held until her death that she would continue to enjoy the income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.193" offset="9368764">And as the Court noted in Le Gierse, and coming back to this interrelation, the Court said in Le Gierse that the only risk the insurance company assumes is an investment risk that the funds which it holds will not earn as much as it has agreed to pay to the annuity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.204" offset="9452774">In speaking of that, the Court was referring not to the annuity alone but to the entire fund held at its disposal.</text>
