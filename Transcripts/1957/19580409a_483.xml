            <label>Mr. Lawrence Speiser</label>
            <text syncTime="19.933" offset="79726">I would like to discuss two points in the cases of which I think are fundamental both to these cases as well as to the preceding ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.147" offset="112536">One is the question of the infringement on freedom of speech as encompassed within the language of the constitutional amendment and within Revenue and Taxation Code Section 32 and the reason why this language has not been limited by the State Supreme Court and its interpretation of it to language of advocacy as a rule of incitement but encompasses within it, advocacy which is -- which may be merely discussion or advocacy of abstract principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.802" offset="255164">And secondly, I would like to discuss the fact that there is no legitimate legislative objective to the constitutional amendment which is an issue here and that is totally unrelated to the purposes of the various exemptions which are granted under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.323" offset="329247">Now, it has been indicated in various decisions and I believe that the appellees will agree that indirect infringements on freedom of speech may be fully as coercive in their effect as direct infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.932" offset="383687">The Douds case seemed to indicate that and Justice Burton indicated that in a situation like this where individuals fall within a general class in which they would otherwise obtain an exemption if they are excluded from this.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.337" offset="457247">Isn't this in effect a direct tax?</text>
            <text syncTime="116.722" offset="466860">My answer is yes, this would be just the same effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.743" offset="478877">You're looking at the substance of the matter not the form.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.087" offset="496327">Now, if you do have an indirect infringement, as I contend that you do, in this case, then there has to be a determination as to whether the terms of the particular legislation with constitutional amendment affect free speech and we have to look at the terms themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.447" offset="585770">Now, first of all, there was no interpretation on the part of the State Supreme Court of the second clause, advocacy of the support of a foreign government against the United States in the event of hostilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.561" offset="630178">So there is no gloss on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.384" offset="637492">There is no indication as to whether they were merely restricting that to advocacy which might be advocacy in the form of incitement.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.487" offset="673855">Now, as far as the first part is concerned, the State Supreme Court said this.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.041" offset="696111">Now, the opinion of the State Supreme Court in the First Unitarian Church cases sets forth their reasoning for the decisions which they made in the cases here at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.354" offset="745326">So I'm going to be referring to the opinion of the State Supreme Court most of the time and its opinion in the First Unitarian Church cases which came up just before the cases that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.254" offset="792973">They are printed in the jurisdictional statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.365" offset="801437">They are not printed in the record of our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.886" offset="811468">Now on page 39 of the of the appendix to the jurisdictional statement, the State Supreme Court said this, “In the present case, it is apparent that the limitation imposed by Section 19 of Article 20 as a condition of exemption from taxation is not a limitation on mere belief but is a limitation on action.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.691" offset="894746">The advocacy of certain proscribed conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.264" offset="908957">What one may merely belief is not prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.741" offset="922958">It is only advocates of the subversive doctrines who are affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.805" offset="939154">Advocacy constitutes action and the instigation of actions not mere belief or opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.415" offset="969561">Now, there's no reference in their discussion at all to advocacy which discussion, advocacy of abstract principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.679" offset="1002684">They apparently make just two categories, advocacy of action -- excuse me, advocacy which constitutes action.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.593" offset="1038315">I'm not quite sure what they mean by that but -- and then advocacy which is instigation of action and then on the other side of the fence, not mere belief or opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.533" offset="1082096">From the tenor of their remarks though, it is apparent that they seem to feel that advocacy itself is action and this is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.438" offset="1125669">This Court has had this matter before it on a number of occasions and it isn't a question of whether the advocacy of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.083" offset="1152313">That isn't how the question is decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.831" offset="1159314">It's whether speech is so close to action in certain situations that the State may validly place limitations on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.162" offset="1192647">So, I feel that they have incorrectly talk of advocacy in terms of action and since they have left out this broad area with which we are mainly concerned of, what about advocacy that does not take on the color of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.312" offset="1253146">It isn't incitement but it's merely advocacy in the form of discussion, advocacy which is in the form of -- of pleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.451" offset="1281776">Where does that fit in?</text>
            <text syncTime="321.681" offset="1286687">They don't discuss this.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.606" offset="1290344">They make the two categories, advocacy constituting action and instigation that's action and belief or opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.301" offset="1329110">Then they go on to explain themselves and discuss the Dennis case and what they conceive to be the holding of the Dennis case and this is where I think it is fairly clear that they have misinterpreted the Dennis case and what advocacy may or may not be punished or penalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.021" offset="1400059">On the jurisdictional statements of the instant cases on page 46, the Court says, “In that case, Dennis versus the United States, the Court upheld an instruction to the jury that if the defendants actively advocated governmental overthrow by force and violence as feebly as circumstances would permit, then as a matter of law, there is sufficient danger of a substantive evil that the Congress has the right to prevent to justify the application of the statute under the First Amendment of the Constitution.”</text>
            <text syncTime="381.072" offset="1524193">In the present case, the constitutional provision is concerned with those who advocate the same prohibited activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.336" offset="1557316">Well, if they had correctly stated what Dennis meant, then I would not be able to make the point that I'm making but they have incorrectly stated it and they -- they stated it in even less rigorous terms and the trial court had in Yates which this Court recently determined was not sufficient in -- to define advocacy which may be penalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.872" offset="1667448">Now, as the Court pointed out in Yates and -- and in Dennis and Justice Frankfurter's conferring opinion in Dennis that there are three factors in determining the advocacy that may be penalized that one, was that it be a rule of action, two, by language that reasonably calculated to incite persons to such action and three, and was intended to overthrow the Government by force and violence as soon as circumstances permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.857" offset="1775386">The State Supreme Court makes no references, no reference to any of those three factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.198" offset="1796702">They do so in the term as speedily as circumstances permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.783" offset="1823033">They used the term “actively advocate” and I'm not sure what they mean by that.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.870" offset="1843409">You may actively discuss.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.130" offset="1848424">You may actively advocate as an -- an abstract principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.470" offset="1865874">So, they don't talk about advocacy as a rule of action and that this statute was intended to hit at that type of advocacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.757" offset="1914984">Even the Yates instruction was better than the -- the instruction of the lower court in Yates was better than this because they at least have the last factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.810" offset="1955213">And then to further make clear of the fact that they completely misconstrued advocacy which may be penalized, they make the statement and it's on the jurisdiction -- in the jurisdictional statement in the appendix, page 47.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.536" offset="2010070">It must be said that such advocacy from whatever source imposes a threat to our Government and that the gravity of the evil is not to be materially discounted by its improbability from the meaning of the test which employed in the Dennis case.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.767" offset="2083004">There, they directly misstate the hand rule which was adopted in the -- the Dennis case because the hand rule says that the gravity of the evil is to be discounted by its improbability.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.750" offset="2146952">And yet, the State Supreme Court says that the gravity of the evil is not to be materially discounted by its improbability.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.808" offset="2195226">Now, the --</text>

            <text syncTime="549.106" offset="2196376">Does that -- are you implying that this Court must be convinced that there was great danger of people proposing the more or less immediate overthrow of the Government of California or the United States?</text>
            <text syncTime="561.195" offset="2244754">Is that what you're arguing?</text>

            <text syncTime="564.917" offset="2259592">I am suggesting that in this case that there is an infringement on freedom of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.382" offset="2289476">Whether its justified I'll get to in a moment, but I'm arguing the fact that the State Supreme Court in its interpretation meant to include within the context of the constitutional amendment in the oath, advocacy protected by the First Amendment unless there's some justifiable reason for infringing on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.846" offset="2375367">Now, the reason I'm making this distinction because of the question that Your Honor raised yesterday in which you posed to Mr. Warren an oath framed in terms of incitement as distinct from in terms of advocacy which may be speech.</text>

            <text syncTime="1064.339" offset="4257332">And I'm in the category that's been affected by the constitutional amendment in which makes two categories, advocates and non-advocate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.568" offset="4302263">Now, in determining what the purpose of the constitutional amendment and this comes to the second point that I'm raising or have -- we can look at the language of the State Supreme Court and then look at the purposes of exemptions because it says that it applies to all exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.520" offset="4370077">The purpose -- so the State Supreme Court says, and this is in the jurisdictional statement on page 31, “It may properly be said that the primary purpose for Article 20 was to provide for the protection of the revenues of the State from impairment by those who would seek to destroy it by unlawful means.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.812" offset="4443220">Well, this was not suggested either by the legislature nor even by the appellees.</text>

            <text syncTime="1119.273" offset="4477074">And as a matter of fact, there is no impairment which has been shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.740" offset="4490867">The only effect that this could have would be to increase revenues, not impairment with starting out with exemptees as a group, the exemptions which have been granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.272" offset="4529006">And I'm not contending that exemptions rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.383" offset="4537469">I have recognized they're privileges and gratuities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.078" offset="4560248">And then the second purpose which was suggested by the State Supreme Court was that the interest of the State in maintaining the loyalty of its people and thus safeguarding against its violent overthrow by internal or external forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.220" offset="4620852">Well, this argument doesn't hold up because that there isn't any way that this does prevent the violent overthrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.873" offset="4671425">Now, with regard to loyalty, but the question was like, this is really to induce loyalty and that the State Supreme Court was looking at the constitutional amendment when it made the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.040" offset="4728059">Now, if you're going to determine the purpose of it and connection with tax exemptions, we have to look at all of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.564" offset="4754181">You can't just look at the veteran.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.992" offset="4767869">You have to look at income tax exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.691" offset="4778736">What is the purpose of -- of an income's tax exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.468" offset="4789812">Is it to promote loyalty or cemeteries or churches or growing crops and fruit in not growing trees?</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.316" offset="4829205">We have exemptions for that in California and householders and -- they all have different purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.559" offset="4854178">They were all created for different reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.234" offset="4876852">And we have to consider all those purposes in determining whether this constitutional amendment has some reasonable relationship to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.580" offset="4910289">If it doesn't then it must fall in violating substantive due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.362" offset="4925440">It's not reasonably related to some legitimate, legislative objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.107" offset="4964415">But even if we just consider the veteran's exemption, the veteran's exemption was created in 1911.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.438" offset="5013734">Justice Brennan was interested in this yesterday and it would have two major purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.595" offset="5038289">One was it's a reward for past honorable service, honorable discharge from the Arm Forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.820" offset="5059187">And secondly, it has an objective in assisting veterans who presumably have lost during wartime service because it's limited to veterans who have less than $5000 worth of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.554" offset="5114149">These are the two purposes they have had.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.195" offset="5132748">It's not -- and the -- there is no requirement that veterans as a group keep up a pattern of good moral character.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.923" offset="5163677">The -- the character is established when they got their honorable discharge just as it is for bonuses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.454" offset="5185724">There is no requirement that they not commit crimes, felonies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.221" offset="5212787">There's nothing at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.830" offset="5215295">There's no disqualification because reward for past service and because trying to help veterans with some economic assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.417" offset="5261584">Now, the purpose of the amendment, the constitutional amendment was set out in the argument of the voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.714" offset="5290841">I'm sorry the Court does not yet have the arguments of the voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.892" offset="5303484">I'll leave the portions of it applying to the exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.387" offset="5325531">This means that no organization advocating the overthrow of the United States or the State could operate as a charity and avoid paying taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.576" offset="5358237">It also means that any such person or organization would not be entitled to certain business and income tax exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.816" offset="5387180">This will have the effect of hitting such persons or organizations in the pocket book.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.548" offset="5410168">There is no valid reason why such exemption should be allowed to a Communist and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.115" offset="5432424">No right thinking person should object to making a declaration that he's not a Communist before receiving such exemptions from the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.465" offset="5461786">The last sentence really doesn't apply because it makes no provisions for such a declaration but this is the reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.784" offset="5483102">It's a penalization, it's coercion, it's an attempt to inhibit advocacy that was within the protection of the First Amendment and it's the real reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.768" offset="5523017">It has nothing to do with the -- the purposes of the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.221" offset="5532839">It's no more -- has no more to do with negating the purpose of the church exemption and raising morality or the veteran's exemption or the cemetery exemption has no -- no relation to that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.786" offset="5575053">Its sole function is penalization to inhibit free speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.820" offset="5595220">Now, it's true, there've been cases that have allowed infringement on free -- on speech as incidental effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.511" offset="5626044">The Douds case where you have a situation, but you have to weigh the danger to the country from interference with interstate commerce by political strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.923" offset="5659690">There are government employee cases but none of those were aimed at the advocacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.758" offset="5679020">They were aimed at setting qualifications because there was a sufficient to danger to warranty infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.580" offset="5698247">None of the cases in which you had situations for that kind have allowed infringements to be the purpose of the qualification.</text>

            <text syncTime="2684.762" offset="10739043">Mr. Justice Black, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.238" offset="10752940">I hope that this brief is plausible, some rather broad issues in the time remaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.960" offset="10771749">I hope to try to pinpoint four issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.483" offset="10781884">One is the form of the oath, second, its interpretation, third, the substantive evil to be met and fourth, the place for the interplay of state action and the exercise of the powers of the State in this picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.004" offset="10851997">Now, first in regard to the form of the oath, I'd like to refer, Your Honors, to page 43 of the record in this case where the oath is set out at the bottom of an exemplar of the form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.738" offset="10910929">I merely do that for information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.084" offset="10916258">I just like to make a point now very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.771" offset="10930991">We will note that this is enclosed as part of an oath already taken that under California law, as covered in page 59 of our brief, an affirmation or since 1957, a declaration under penalty of perjury may be substituted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.962" offset="11003820">As I point out in the same place in our brief, the burden to obtain a tax exemption like this is on the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.318" offset="11045198">On that page, I cite what should be Section 260, 260 of the Revenue Taxation Code in the State of California which provides that burden and which provides for waiver in the absence of the execution of the oath required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.633" offset="11118446">This is more fully covered on pages 59 and 61 of the brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="2797.230" offset="11188872">Well now, that that is my second point, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.597" offset="11198380">As I read the holding of the California Supreme Court in this case, particularly in page 53 of the record in the Unitarian Church case, the -- in first referring to the Dennis case, the Court says the Dennis case involved the validity of the Smith Act which prohibited and made criminal the advocacy of the activities announced by the people of the State and its constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.923" offset="11287615">In other words, it refers to the same activity which prohibited and made criminal the activity, the advocacy of the activities denounced by the people of the State and its constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.003" offset="11331918">If we skip the quotation from the Dennis case, later on, we note that the Court states in the present case, the constitutional provision is concerned with those who advocate the same prohibited activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.506" offset="11393985">I think probably that we should be able to take the California Supreme Court and its word.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.291" offset="11413107">Now, my point would be that in the Yates case, in the Dennis case, in the Garner case, the Douds case, the Adler case and the Gerende case, in each of those cases, this Court was faced with a problem of an oath governing advocacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.938" offset="11483742">In many cases, the forms of the oath were brought that they covered other types of conduct besides such as advising and in teaching.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.263" offset="11512999">My point is the Court has always emphasized that each of these particular provisions calls for interpretation that it must be construed as interpreted by the State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.676" offset="11554691">I contend on the basis of this language that the state court has given it such interpretation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3140.033" offset="12560091">And they held in that case that crime referred to crime as exists under California law and, of course, in California we do have statutory crimes under our penal code.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.172" offset="12608679">So, therefore, I believe, Your Honor, there is a basis for construing other unlawful means, although I will admit to Your Honors, that the -- it has not been specifically construed although it has been covered with the decisions of this Court, particularly, in Garner.</text>
