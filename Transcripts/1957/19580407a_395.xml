            <text syncTime="16.907" offset="67605">Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.400" offset="109505">In the previous references to this Court, to this case, the Court has been informed that the Court of Appeals held for the Government to the extent of saying that we had a right to follow the insurance payments to the extent of the cash surrender value in the hands of the -- that had been in the hands of the deceased.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.474" offset="233848">It held against the Government however, by limiting the liability of the beneficiary to this cash surrender value and holding that the reminder of the insurance payments were received free and clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.399" offset="301558">The Government petitioned from the portion of the judgment against it and Mrs. Bess petitioned from the portion of the judgment which held her liable to the extent of the cash surrender value.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.672" offset="366655">Now, up to a certain point the facts in this case are the same as the facts in the Stern case.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.798" offset="399151">The nature of the insurance policies is generally the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.681" offset="418691">There were eight insurance policies involved in this case and as to one of them which was a group insurance policy, there was no cash surrender value, but as to the remaining seven there were substantial cash surrender values.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.944" offset="483683">The premiums were paid by the deceased and in this case this is made specific in the stipulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.806" offset="523180">The insured retained the right to change the beneficiary to assign the policies, the right to draw down cash surrender value or to borrow against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.336" offset="593293">When the taxpayer died, his estate was insufficient to pay the amount of taxes which had accrued before his death.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.898" offset="639582">There is one respect though that this case differs from the Stern case and that is that for two of the three years for which liability is involved, the assessment was made and notice and demand was given to the taxpayer before his death.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.791" offset="715128">This is important because it resulted in the attachment of a lien to all of his property and rights and it is the contention of the Governments that this included a lien with respect to his life insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.631" offset="782524">But leaving aside for a moment the question of the existence of a lien, our position in this case is precisely the same as it was in the Stern case which has just been argued.</text>

            <text syncTime="285.129" offset="1140506">We can prove no intention to deprive creditors or no voluntary payment by him while he was insolvent.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.288" offset="1181048">But as I say, leaving to one side the question of a lien, our position in this case is precisely as -- the same as it was in Stern.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.178" offset="1216679">We believe that there is nothing inherent in life insurance that makes it different from savings deposit of a third party contract under which one buys something for another.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.159" offset="1268611">The taxpayer in this case retained complete control over the disposition of this property until the time he died and unless the Government can follow this material -- these payments into the hands of the beneficiary, these payments will -- would be taken away from his estate and turned over to the beneficiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.593" offset="1370279">But the existence of the lien in this case provides us with an additional argument for recovery of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.938" offset="1399745">Now of course the attachment of a lien depends in the first instance on whether or not there was property or rights in the insured to which the liens could attach.</text>

            <text syncTime="375.087" offset="1500264">There has to be a property interest in the -- in the insured to which a lien can attach or we got nowhere with the lien theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.346" offset="1541329">If -- if the insured had no -- had no interest in this insurance during his life and at the time the assessment was made, then there was nothing for the lien to attach.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.818" offset="1591171">But on our theory of the case, the lien attached both to the cash surrender value which he could have drawn down and to his interest in the proceeds which he had a complete right to assign and up until the moment of his death.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.171" offset="1656581">I think my point is made clear by comparison of two cases decided by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.434" offset="1685734">The first of these cases is the Rowen case to which reference has already been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.522" offset="1706005">And in that case the Court held that the insured did have a property interest in the cash surrender value but that state law prevented there being liability on the part of the beneficiary and that case was decided I think in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.695" offset="1798687">Then in 1956, the same court had before it the case of United States against Behrens, and in this case, a lien -- the tax had been assessed before the insured's death.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.827" offset="1855216">And in that case, the New York Court of Appeals said that the New York law could not defeat a federal lien once it is attached and in that case they held the beneficiary liable to the extent of the cash surrender value on the basis -- on the ground that a lien had attached to that interest of the -- of the insured.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.822" offset="1955213">A similar holding was made by the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in United States against Hoper, and again the Court said that the exemptions or the provisions of the particular state law could not stand up when a lien had attached to the interest of the insured and the property had passed with that lien to the beneficiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.552" offset="2062106">In other words, these courts treat the lien they don't have to go into a question of transferee liability when there is a lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.885" offset="2091468">They say that the property does move from one to the other and it moves subject to the lien.</text>

            <text syncTime="1066.107" offset="4264333">Mrs. Bess seeks to meet our argument with respect to the lien in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.757" offset="4287007">First, she asserts that we may not support the District Court's decision on the basis of the lien's theory since we did not argue the lien theory in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.244" offset="4352940">I submit that this attempt to bar the argument as disputable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.281" offset="4369032">It is well accepted that a lower party may not attack a judgment below on a new ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.531" offset="4398080">It may on an appeal support a judgment on any ground that is available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.365" offset="4417411">We argued the lien theory in the Court of Appeals and we reserve the support of the lien theory in our petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.446" offset="4453773">And so I submit that it is proper to present it to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.935" offset="4471641">The second argument against the lien theory presented by Mrs. Bess is that no lien attached in this case because the taxpayer did not, and now I quote from the statute, “neglect or refuse to pay his taxes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.057" offset="4556173">And the reason that is said that the taxpayer did not neglect is that we have not proved that the taxpayer was careless or negligent on -- neglectful in failing to pay his taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.924" offset="4623673">And the tax -- and Mrs. Bess would read that element into the end of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.227" offset="4648856">I submit that there word "neglect" in the sense of his lien means to fail to perform a duty which is to pay a debt which is required to be paid rather than to fail to pay it under circumstances of negligence or carelessness.</text>

            <text syncTime="1199.639" offset="4798485">We have in this Bess case two issues, one of which has been argued and which I had hoped would require of the expenditure of only a small account or small amount of time on my part.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.205" offset="4872777">And they made the transferee question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.572" offset="4890227">However I should like to say a few words about the transferee question but I will reserve that until after I have talked with respect to the lien theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.526" offset="4950100">We intend to argue the merits of the lien question, but first we interpose this objection to its being considered by the court at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.883" offset="5015510">The tax lien theory is an entirely separate clause of action, separate and apart from the transferee liability if one exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.289" offset="5073084">Now, the complaint in the United States District Court did not plea the lien theory, it wasn't presented to the United States District Court for decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.499" offset="5121985">The case was presented to the Court upon a stipulation of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.055" offset="5144137">The stipulation necessarily was directed towards a presentation of those issues which the pleadings had raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.483" offset="5189904">The lien theory was raised for the first time in the answering brief filed in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.531" offset="5222087">The same objection was made and it was also argued on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.285" offset="5249045">The Court of Appeals in its decision is silent with respect to the lien issue so much for that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1487.386" offset="5949544">My answer to that is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.218" offset="5960829">That if this did not create or if this was not the basis for a completely separate cause of action I would have to concede his argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.681" offset="6006700">And this I think is the difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.923" offset="6015687">Now, I should like to move on to the merits of the lien theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.537" offset="6034077">Our first point is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.272" offset="6045048">Section 3670 of the Internal Revenue Code is a section which imposes the lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.178" offset="6072633">It does not impose a lien with respect to tax due, it specifically sets up conditions which we say are conditions precedent or conditions perquisite to the arising of a lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.885" offset="6139507">These conditions are that a tax must be assessed and demand for payment made and this is the material portion of the statute if the taxpayer then neglects or refuses to pay, there shall be a lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.279" offset="6217038">The stipulation of facts in this case sets forth that the taxes for the years 1945 and 1946 were assessed on the very same day pursuant to a waiver signed by the taxpayer on the very same day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.732" offset="6310870">The demand for payment was made upon the taxpayer upon the very same day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.302" offset="6337202">That is all of these on different dates but simultaneously with respect to both years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.946" offset="6359771">The stipulation then sets forth that from that point to the date of his death, Herman Bess, the taxpayer was making periodic payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.606" offset="6410344">The stipulation however as drawn would seem to -- would seem to indicate that these payments were made only with respect to 1945, that no payments seemingly were made with respect to 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.410" offset="6481607">It is our contention that these periodic payments which were made, were made with respect to one tax liability although this was a liability for more than one year, and that by entering into this course of making periodic payments which must have been I assume we can infer they must have been with a consent of the tax collector not only has the Government failed in its burden of affirmatively establishing that there was neglect or refusal but I believe the stipulation contradicts this and on the contrary establishes that the taxpayer neither neglected nor refused and therefore we say that no lien arose by virtue of these two tax years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.880" offset="6695497">And there are only those two years involved of the balance of tax which the Government is seeking to recover is for three years, the year 1947 a comparatively small amount was assessed after Mr. Bess had died.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.566" offset="6762162">Secondly, with respect to the merits of the lien issue, we say that a life insurance policy is a contract pursuant to which there are many rights that is all of the parties, the insurance company, the insured, and the beneficiary who is named in this policy have contractual rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.959" offset="6883788">Again, Section 3670 of the Internal Revenue Code which imposes the lien imposes this lien upon, I quote, “The property or rights to property of the taxpayer.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.369" offset="6937391">Therefore, if a lien did arise in favor of the Government in this case, the lien could only impinge upon the property or rights to property of the taxpayer who is Herman Bess.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.157" offset="6996532">The law in New Jersey where these people reside is specific and clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.296" offset="7025162">There is a long line of cases and the law is well established in New Jersey to this effect namely that the rights of a beneficiary can only be eliminated by changing the beneficiary pursuant to the terms written into the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.955" offset="7127771">The courts have gone so far in New Jersey as to hold in the case of Anderson National Bank, it's cited in my brief, a case in which the insured borrowed money from a bank and made an assignment of the insurance policy to the bank as collateral for the loan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.298" offset="7221185">Before the loan was paid, the insured died, the question then arose whether the proceeds were to be paid to the beneficiary, the wife of the insured or were to be paid to the bank who held the assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.508" offset="7297985">In a well considered opinion which was later affirmed by the highest court in New Jersey at that time, the Court of Errors and Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.020" offset="7336020">The Court reviewed the preceding authorities and concluded that in New Jersey the courts will enforce the contract, the life insurance contract as it is written and will protect the rights of all parties to do otherwise the Court said would mean to alter or vary the terms of a written contract, an authority which the Court had no power to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="1873.203" offset="7492754">The right to cash surrender the policy had been reserved and of course the right to assign the policy had been reserved until the assignment occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.117" offset="7524415">Now, the Court goes further into the -- into an analysis of the insurance policy and points out that the policy itself imposes obligations as well as granting rights, namely the insurance contract imposes an obligation upon the insurance company to pay the beneficiary a fixed amount of money upon the death of the insured, and although the insured has the right to change this beneficiary, in the absence of such a change the insurance company is not relieved of its obligation under the contract, and must pay the beneficiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.850" offset="7707376">Now, that being the case and since neither Section 3670 nor any other section of the Internal Revenue Code defines what is the property or rights to property, to which this lien if one exists, to which this lien attaches, it is our view that we must resort to the law of the state to determine what is the property or the rights to property of the taxpayer, we contend and we urge upon this Court, that in New Jersey the rights to property of Herman Bess the insured were a mere option terminable at his death.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.895" offset="7895562">That when he died, his option to surrender the policy for cash or to change the beneficiary terminated, that the obligation of the insurance company to pay did not arise at that moment, but arose when the policy was taken out, when the premiums were paid and when the beneficiary was originally designated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.689" offset="7994723">We say then that if the Government had a lien upon the property or rights to property of Herman Bess, this lien was nothing more than a right during Herman Bess' life time, to cease or to compel Herman Bess to obtain this cash surrender value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.570" offset="8078211">As a matter of fact there had been a number of cases in which the Government had sought to collect the cash surrender value during the insured's life time.</text>

            <text syncTime="2092.259" offset="8369006">No court held until recently that the Government could under such circumstances reach the cash surrender value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.368" offset="8401398">There was a recent decision, United States against Metropolitan Life Insurance Company cited in the brief, in which the Court decided that its judgment directed against the insurance company, to pay the cash surrender value had the effect of cancelling the company's obligation to pay the beneficiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.633" offset="8518531">Now, if the Government had a lien in this case, I concede that it might have enforced its lien by restraint and by seizure and in a proper action recovering the cash surrender value.</text>

            <text syncTime="2152.154" offset="8608601">And it had lost any right to proceed after the death of the insured since.</text>

            <text syncTime="2176.771" offset="8707030">It has been rather thoroughly discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.619" offset="8726465">But it seems to me that I should like to point out briefly some elements which apply to the Bess case, possibly to the Stern case which was argued before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.611" offset="8806400">The question basically is whether a transfer was made at such a time and under such circumstances that a creditor can reach the property transferred, and there seems to be no consensus, no one opinion as to when transfer occurs in connection with life insurance policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.519" offset="8922070">This Court as long ago as 1888 in Central National Bank against Hume, decided that the transfer occurred when the premiums were paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.899" offset="8975569">I realize that the facts stated in the opinion are not clear and possibly there may not have been a right on the part of the insured to recapture the cash surrender value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.222" offset="9028859">This is not clear, and I don't know whether that was the case, but nevertheless in that case the Court decided that the transfer occurred when the premiums were paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.697" offset="9082776">The New Jersey statute follows the holding of the Hume case, and I might point out counsel has called the New Jersey statute an exemption statute and I respectfully submit that the New Jersey statute is not an exemption statute, but rather a statute for marshalling the proceeds properly according to law between the beneficiary and any other party, a creditor of the insured, who might under the circumstances of that case be entitled to recover.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.058" offset="9220180">And I say this because the New Jersey statute provide specifically that whether the beneficiary is a stranger, or the wife of the insured, that a creditor can recover from the proceeds to the extent that the insured paid premiums (Inaudible) of creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.188" offset="9296666">Now this statute was enacted shortly after, within a few years after the decision in this Court in the Hume case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.087" offset="9332297">In fact within one year after a court in New Jersey criticized and refused to follow the Hume case, and probably as a result of the court's failure to follow the Hume case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.672" offset="9422681">Now I would -- some courts have held that the transfer occurs when a beneficiary is changed, in those cases and I believe that Rowen was one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.605" offset="9486420">The beneficiary at one time was the estate, the executors of the insured, and when the change, when the beneficiary was changed from the executors of the insured to the insured's wife, that was the occasion when some courts say the transfer of the policy occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.072" offset="9576281">With the exception of the decision in the Bess case by the Third Circuit, I don't think there are any other decisions, at least I don't know of any other decisions, which hold that a transfer occurs at death.</text>

            <text syncTime="2434.884" offset="9739494">In the Hume case the insurance policies were taken out when the insured was insolvent and he paid the premiums when he was insolvent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.376" offset="9785469">The Court in its decision held that the imputation of fraud from payments or diversions of property by a debtor when he was insolvent is not a general imputation but that it depends upon the facts and circumstances of each particular case and in that case this Court enunciated a doctrine which was possibly an extension namely this Court in that case said that public policy recognizes that there is a positive legal as well as moral obligation upon married men to provide for his wife and children and that this can be extended to permit even an insolvent, these are my words, even an insolvent debtor to provide or divert a reasonable portion of his property for the purpose of protecting his wife and children, maintaining the man protecting them in the event of his untimely death.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.986" offset="10087863">Now there has been some question about a transfer of cash surrender value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.442" offset="10113672">And I would just -- I would like to point out that cash surrender value is not a debt, there is no relationship of credit-debtor between the insured and the insurance company until such a time as the insured turns the policy in for surrender.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.076" offset="10176261">It is not a custody account.</text>
