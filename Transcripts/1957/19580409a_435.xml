            <label>Mr. Ralph S. Spritzer</label>
            <text syncTime="38.215" offset="152764">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.894" offset="171572">These two consolidated cases come here on the Government's petitions from decisions of the Sixth and Fifth Circuits respectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.404" offset="225593">The question which they present is whether the Federal Trade Commission, in circumstances which I shall detail later, has been ousted by the McCarran-Ferguson Act of its jurisdiction to issue cease-and-desist orders directed against unfair and deceptive advertising by insurance companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.216" offset="360803">Before I sketch the essential fact of these two cases, I should like to take a very few minutes to state by way of introduction that the Federal Trade Commission has been engaged these past several years in a very active campaign to eliminate from the channels of interstate commerce, false and deceptive advertising by companies selling hospital health and accident insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.269" offset="489012">There have been some 41 cases brought, many of them against major companies and there are various stages of development, the two here today being, of course, the first to reach this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.413" offset="553587">They are important in the Commission's view, these two cases, not only because they will determine in very large measure the phase of the remaining cases, but also because the general situation which has given rise to all of these 41 proceedings is one which the Commission deems of both pressing and truly national concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.599" offset="662361">And that is so because health, hospital and accident insurance have grown so spectacularly in recent years.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.304" offset="693185">It appears, for example, that more than two thirds of all persons in the United States now carry some form of hospitalization insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.560" offset="730175">And these forms of insurance are sold in very great part by companies which do business on a broad frequently national scale.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.090" offset="772284">Some of them selling on a strictly mail order basis, others by other techniques.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.453" offset="801750">Moreover, these companies more and more have come to employ techniques of mass advertising, in some cases, by television and radio or through national periodicals.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.740" offset="850860">And as I suppose everyone who has a mailing address is where many of them has employed the techniques which the advertising business refers to as saturation mail advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.082" offset="908225">It was a consequence of the -- in consequence of this that Mr. Howrey, the then Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission in 1955, advised the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, and I quote his words, “There has been more public interest in our investigation of this advertising than any investigation the Commission has undertaken in my memory.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.799" offset="1023164">We got not hundreds, but thousands of letters of complaint and the public interest in response have been overwhelming.”</text>

            <text syncTime="262.906" offset="1051585">Are you reading from your brief?</text>

            <label>Mr. Ralph S. Spritzer</label>
            <text syncTime="264.772" offset="1059004">No, I am reading from a House Report.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.557" offset="1070184">It is not quoted in our brief, Your Honor -- Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.876" offset="1087425">And I might add that the Chairman of the Committee, before whom Mr. Howrey was appearing, then replied that it was the conviction of the Committee that there was a very great need for Federal Trade Commission action for the benefit of the companies insured.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.769" offset="1167047">Now, with this background, I turn to the facts of these two particular cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.621" offset="1198393">National, the respondent in 435, is incorporated and has its home office in Detroit, Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.721" offset="1230785">It has 350 to 400 agents who are located in all 48 States in the District of Columbia and the territory of Hawaii.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.828" offset="1275298">It's licensed to do business in all of those jurisdictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.716" offset="1294838">It sent some brochures and advertising materials directly from Detroit to people throughout the country who maybe prospective buyers of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.224" offset="1340813">However, the great mass of its material is apparently sent out in both ways to the agents and they, in turn, from such lists as they have or accumulated or accumulate, disseminate to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.335" offset="1409254">National's advertising materials challenged by the Federal Trade Commission complaint in this case had been in use for two years or more when the complaint was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.615" offset="1462439">The complaint charged and the Commission found that they were deceptive in some five major respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.337" offset="1489293">I shall just quick and very briefly since, as I indicated in a moment, our issue here is jurisdictional rather than factual.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.082" offset="1524297">The Commission charged and found that National's advertising first conveyed that the purchaser of the insurance could continue to renew this form of the insurance as he grew older and hence, obtained lifetime protection, whereas in fact, the policy has actually provided that they were cancellable at the option of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.731" offset="1618860">Two, the ads misrepresented the physical standards which the applicant for insurance had to meet.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.565" offset="1646237">Three, they misrepresented that the insured receives broad and complete coverage in relation to hospitalization expenses and fixed -- sick benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.210" offset="1688764">There are being in fact numerous exceptions and qualifications in policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.058" offset="1708199">Four, they misrepresented the amount of benefit payable in the event that the ensured had to go -- undergo surgery.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.381" offset="1741427">Five, they misrepresented the duration of monthly sick benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.597" offset="1766296">American, the respondent in 436, is incorporated and has its home office in Texas, it does business selling health and accident insurance in 14 States where it -- it has applied since then, has agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.126" offset="1836408">It sends its brochures and advertising materials similarly across state lines to its agents who in turn distribute to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.398" offset="1885518">I shan't detail the representations involved in the American case, suffice it that they also relate to the terms and conditions of the policy and to the coverage which they provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.479" offset="1941838">The Commission in American's case found four out of five categories of violations charged has been proved.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.284" offset="1981127">Now, as to the jurisdictional issue in these two cases, which is the only issue that the court below reached, let me note briefly one or two following additional facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.186" offset="2036715">National alleged, and this is conceded, that the jurisdictions in which it does business with the exception of three States and the District Columbia have statutes, have state statutes under which the respective commissioners or departments of insurance might proceed, might issue cease-and-desist orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.116" offset="2156460">There is no suggestion of a showing that any of these States have considered, ruled upon or proceeded in any way in relation to any of the practices.</text>

            <text syncTime="1615.817" offset="6463216">And then it goes on to say that silence on the part of Congress shall not impose any barrier to the regulation or taxation by the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="1825.522" offset="7302060">As I was saying I -- I think our -- our question is, what regulation by a state law means as used in this Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.271" offset="7341035">Now, one will note that the sentence immediately precedingly proviso speaks about any law enacted by any State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.365" offset="7397460">However, the proviso declares that there shall be federal jurisdiction to the extent that such business is not regulated by state laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.204" offset="7440718">Now, I -- I suggest that if Congress had proposed to do so, it would have been a very easy matter to make the incidence of federal power depend upon the enactment of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.052" offset="7508114">Indeed, in the very paragraph, we're here concerned with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.622" offset="7522429">Congress speaks of an act -- enactments under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.567" offset="7542178">Yet, the statute does not provide that the existence of state legislation or the enactment of state law will automatically exclude the Federal Trade Commission from regulating interstate transactions terminating in that State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.666" offset="7626606">On the contrary, the exception is phrased in terms of regulation and we say that regulation and legislation are not unanimous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.685" offset="7686687">It is also relevant I think that many federal Acts and many assertions of federal power are made by Congress to depend specifically on whether there is a state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.596" offset="7742380">Here, we have a -- a different choice of language, not the word "legislation" or not enactment of state laws, but the use of the word "regulation".</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.884" offset="7799536">Now, I don't suggest that one should consider this simply as a -- as a dictionary proposition, certainly it is important to look at the purposes and such light -- to consider such light as maybe cast catch by the history of McCarran-Ferguson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.361" offset="7905384">Now, as the Court is -- I'm sure aware, McCarran-Ferguson was a direct response by the Congress to the decision of this Court in 1944 in United States against South-Eastern Underwriters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.829" offset="7979259">That decision in a Sherman Act case determined for the first time for overruling precedents going back for so many years that the business of insurance was commerce in the sense of the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.680" offset="8070687">Consequently, the Court reinstated a Sherman Act indictment against a group of insurance underwriters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.943" offset="8107677">Immediately, following that opinion, the States and the insurance companies made very strong representations to the Congress, asserting that if the Commerce Clause restrictions apply to the States, to their regulatory measures and to their taxing statutes, that many of the existing state systems, established state systems with the effect it was claimed that there was great confusion and doubt, and that it couldn't be set what state laws would be held to be burdened upon commerce or to be discriminatory against commerce and -- and what -- what is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.697" offset="8306730">Now, it was against this background that Congress passed McCarran-Ferguson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.181" offset="8332643">There's no question that Congress meant to permit the state systems to operate as they had prior to the South-Eastern Underwriters decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.308" offset="8401189">We don't, for a moment, challenge that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.523" offset="8418011">What we do say is that McCarran-Ferguson did not intend to leave any no man's land, any vacuum in which there would be no regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.350" offset="8489378">It wanted to provide for situations in which the States could not act, perhaps for constitutional reasons that applied to particular facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.602" offset="8530338">And it wanted to provide for regulation, we believe, in situations in which the States, though they might act did not choose to act or fail to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.562" offset="8598152">I would like to turn for a few minutes to such history as we have which bears on the meaning of this proviso clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.742" offset="8670877">There were separate bills introduced in each of the two Houses in 1945, following the South-Eastern Underwriters case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.821" offset="8715180">The bills in each House would have provided in one way or another that the States would continue to regulate what they had in the past, the insurance business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.927" offset="8771605">The House Report and also Senator McCarran on the floor of the Senate both pointed out that there were limitations upon what the States could do in relation to out-of-state companies, due process limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.692" offset="8854674">And both the Senate and the House Reports go on to state that the respective bills are designed to ensure adequate and effective regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.265" offset="8917055">Now, McCarran-Ferguson states to be sure that the Federal Government shall not impair the state systems.And the proviso clause declares to be sure that if the States act, the Federal Government will not act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.930" offset="8983719">We suggest that it is one thing to say that the Federal Government shall not impose either conflicting or double regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.314" offset="9029172">It is quite another thing to say that the Federal Government is precluded from acting where the States are not providing any regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2284.955" offset="9139722">Well, I think all state regulation would have to be by or pursuant to state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.359" offset="9161352">But what I'm trying to distinguish between is a piece of legislation which delegates authority to an administrative agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.680" offset="9226658">The legislation itself and the regulation, which I think is only completed under a statute of this kind when the administrative machinery is used.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.784" offset="9275037">What I have in mind, I think, is what was very colorfully stated by the late Justice Jackson in the Ruberoid case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.207" offset="9324774">There, he was not talking about the Federal Trade Commission Act but about the Robinson-Patman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.104" offset="9356330">And in speaking of Robinson-Patman, he considered the administrative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.326" offset="9381303">He first pointed out that Robinson-Patman sets up general standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.849" offset="9403350">And then, he went on to say, “Such legislation,” I'm looking at page 53 of the Government's brief, “represents in inchoate law, in the sense that it does not lay down rules which call for immediate compliance on paying of punishment by judicial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.572" offset="9482240">The intervention of another authority must mature and perfect an effective rule of conduct before one is subject to coercion.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.240" offset="9520901">And then, he goes on to develop the -- the points that under a statute like this, there is an expanded legislative power which goes to the administrative agency."</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.005" offset="9575967">And only when the general standards of the statute are given meaning and content in the specific case, only when a rule or order is issued,” he says, “does one have regulation," and that is the argument we are making here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.991" offset="9655902">And we think that that is the sense in which one should read regulated by state law in this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.021" offset="9687980">If one is to avoid the situation where there will be a regulatory void, the experience has been, as perhaps might have been anticipated, perhaps because of the difficulties of the States in dealing with this situation, the experience in any event has been that the States has not been acting in this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.508" offset="9789962">Now, we think that McCarran-Ferguson made clear that the States could act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.090" offset="9816294">It made clear moreover that they might act if they chose free of Commerce Clause restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.492" offset="9841894">But we don't think that federal regulation in the sense that I'm speaking about, regulation by the institution of administrative proceedings and the issuance of administrative orders that such federal regulation is precluded unless there is at least some consideration, some ruling, some determination by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.062" offset="9940219">Now, I don't say that the State has to decide that it will file a cease-and-desist proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.251" offset="9964983">I think the State might rule through its Commissioner or other officer that certain practices from the standpoint of that State are all right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.316" offset="10009182">And if it does that, we concede that that is a ruling or determination, that is regulation which would prevent a federal order from being applied to the insurance company doing business in that State.</text>
