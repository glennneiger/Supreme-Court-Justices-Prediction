            <text syncTime="125.225" offset="500820">Before you ever get to that, their fallacy is in supposing that because District 50 elected not to file the affidavits and the financial reports that the Board cannot conduct an election.</text>

            <text syncTime="181.041" offset="724114">And in order to see it that that influence, that illicit influence is dissipated, the Board has a right to recommend or formulate certain measures.</text>

            <text syncTime="818.106" offset="3272411">The election they conduct is -- it would be -- the ballot would be, Teamsters - yes and Teamsters - no.</text>

            <text syncTime="838.910" offset="3355585">The situation in this changing world grew up when the Sections 9 (f), (g), and (h) were added to the Taft-Hartley Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.931" offset="3415667">Under the old law, certification was not subject to those restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.021" offset="3456000">Now, when the Taft-Hartley Act came in, the Board blithely went on applying the same rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.345" offset="3493303">And to our mind, if we have a right to elect, to file or not to file, and I think Mr. Justice Burton and the Court made that point clear in the Arkansas Flooring case.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.804" offset="3559131">If we have the right of election to file or not to file and if the men have a right to choose a union that has not filed, then the Board by no form of contrivance of order can take away that right from the men and that right from the union expressly conferred by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.346" offset="3669368">Now, they talked about something incidental.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.938" offset="3691729">In looking up incidental in Webster, the phrase meaning that it gives that is happening as a chance or underlying feature of something else, casual.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.381" offset="3741466">It's not a prime concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.610" offset="3758393">It is extremely difficult for me to see anything undesigned whereas a union that the Board knows has never filed under 9 (f), (g), and (h), nor did the determination of the international union has never survived.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.106" offset="3852330">And they issue an order which says, "Because of the state of your mind, because you insist on your rights under the device of this order, we're going to put you out of business down here and you will never be able to represent it."</text>
            <text syncTime="983.555" offset="3934145">And if they could do it in that instance, why, all the employer would have to do, he'd say, "I will -- I will give a little assistance to District 50."</text>
            <text syncTime="995.889" offset="3983464">Whisper it to the other union and let them file an unfair labor charge and then I'll never have District 50 again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.745" offset="4014916">I don't know whether the Bowman Transportation Company wanted any union or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.635" offset="4038531">Its in the -- they might have been figuring they were taking the lesser of two evils, because they haven't appeared to argue the case in the Court of Appeals and they haven't appeared here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.545" offset="4090149">Now, if the order of the Board was wrong, we come to the question of Mr. Justice Whittaker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.672" offset="4118674">Had the Board -- had the Court any power to modify the order?</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.116" offset="4148454">I know of no language more clearer than that found in Sections 10 (e) and (f) of the Act where it gives the Court of Appeals when the case is brought up to them, power to enforce or modify and of enforcing it as modified the order of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.651" offset="4258586">Now, you can say it's all scripted or asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.119" offset="4272379">There is no limitation on that power, except if there is any substantial evidence, the courts have to regard the finding of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.504" offset="4322011">In Section 10 (e), you find and that's where a party brings it up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.559" offset="4354194">In that Section, they cannot raise any question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.612" offset="4370390">The Court cannot consider any question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.737" offset="4382929">It has not been raised before the Board of the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.406" offset="4401528">Now, we will not apply it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.034" offset="4420127">We came into the case when we saw this order which would put us out of business and gets them and in the Bowman Tracking Company's operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.888" offset="4479478">We then filed a petition to review under 10 (f) which provides that any aggrieved person can petition the Board or the Court for review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.052" offset="4528170">And Section 10 (d) provides that so long as the Board hasn't filed the record in a Court to ask for enforcement, any person can apply to the Board for them to modify an order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.283" offset="4597029">We came in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.058" offset="4608209">And the Board first thought, we will eliminate them because they didn't take exception in 20 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.579" offset="4638302">The court below found that we were not a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.770" offset="4655020">Also, the Board withdrew from that contention and our power under the statute and under the rules and regulations of the Board to petition them for modification was never questioned any further, the stipulation it left, the 20 days in, they had raised that, paragraph (c) was eliminated by later stipulation and by order of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.813" offset="4771213">Now, to my mind, it seems quite clear that where it isn't on a matter of fact but on a matter of law, the courts have the power to correct the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.979" offset="4855850">They have the power to modify and to enforce as modified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.801" offset="4883122">In those cases that they cited under note 15, on page 32 of their brief, where you find every one of those cases, the courts did consider modification and in some, they did modify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.001" offset="4943935">The first time the Board named the teamster -- the charging union and we won't punish you for working with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.038" offset="4980088">Then, they suggested, add or any other union and the cases put that in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.849" offset="5011331">Then, respondent suggested or refrained from joining, if you want to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.444" offset="5037767">And to put that in, the Board didn't object to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.778" offset="5051037">You find that a -- then a gradual change.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.101" offset="5068382">Now, we didn't ask the Court to modify the notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.861" offset="5103386">Mr. Judge Washington said that we didn't offer a suggestion to the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.194" offset="5120731">Well, we didn't because we hadn't studied their opinion intently enough to know what to suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.162" offset="5152601">We didn't because they wouldn't welcome our suggestion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.005" offset="5167961">A counsel stated in the court below on argument when Judge Washington asked him that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.466" offset="5193770">He said, "Well, we might as well face it if they'd suggested that we would've paid any attention to it."</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.858" offset="5215399">And furthermore, it seems strange to me that if your rights have been violated, that you will forfeit a chance to raise the question unless you suggest to the violator some other way to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.586" offset="5286243">To my mind, there is no such duty to enact rules for the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.211" offset="5320829">We told them it was wrong and when the Court asked us what we would suggest, we picked from the language of the Board's opinion, until the man has the union, has been freely chosen in an atmosphere free of the improper influence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1424.372" offset="5697411">And that the case has never been up before any Court, except the Fourth Circuit and this court below, and they both agreed with this that the Court -- I mean, that the Board did not have power to write such an order.</text>

            <text syncTime="1478.514" offset="5914018">Most people who fight for their rights are not well received by the people with whom they fight.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.867" offset="5943380">But if we didn't fight for our rights, if men want -- willing to litigate for their rights, there wouldn't be any use of me standing up here.</text>
