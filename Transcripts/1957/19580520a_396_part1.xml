            <text syncTime="9.325" offset="37198">Mr. Sand, you may proceed in this case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Leonard B. Sand</label>
            <text syncTime="12.794" offset="51096">Mr. Chief Justice, this case involves five natives of China who arrived in the United States seeking admission at various dates.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.810" offset="87144">Four of them, prior to the effective date of the Immigration Act of 1952, and the fifth, Leng May Ma, subsequent to the effective date.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.992" offset="131866">All of the aliens were -- were ordered excluded and again, as in the previous case, no question is raised as to the validity of the orders of an exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.212" offset="176797">Also as in the -- in the prior case, the aliens were -- were granted parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.665" offset="206576">Applications under 243 (h) were filed and the Attorney General took the position as he did in the earlier case that he had no power to act under that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.824" offset="247223">The plaintiff of the -- the respondents sought declaratory relief in the Court -- in the District Court in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.344" offset="285362">The District Court dismissed the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.045" offset="300095">The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia reversed, holding it that when the alien was paroled into the United States, he was then an alien within the United States, within the meaning of Section 243 (h).</text>
            <text syncTime="89.924" offset="359654">In short therefore, the issues presented by this case are in no major respects identical with those in the earlier case.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.610" offset="402390">And I would like now to direct myself to the -- to the question which Mr. Justice Black posed towards the conclusion of the previous argument and that is whether Congress in the Immigration Act of 1952 explicitly provided that parole would not author the immigration status of the alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.312" offset="513149">And I think we have to begin, if I may, with the same perspective that the Congress which passed this Act began and that is in the light of history because the concept of paroling excluded aliens is not a new one.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.243" offset="576888">In the case of Kaplan against Tod, the petitioner was small child, had the misfortune of being feeble-minded.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.807" offset="615131">She came to the United States in the company of her mother to join her father.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.084" offset="636238">She was ordered excluded because of her mental condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.070" offset="652225">She was paroled to a welfare society which in turn placed her in the custody of her father.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.272" offset="681064">World War I intervenes, so that it was not safe to send the child back to the country from which she came.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.672" offset="706664">For nine years, she in fact lived with her father in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.303" offset="733205">Mr. Justice Holmes speaking for unanimous court in Kaplan against Tod said that -- that paroling the excluded alien did not bring her in the United States therefore purposes of the Naturalization Act and for purposes of the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.848" offset="811363">And the --</text>

          <turn speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="204.253" stopTime="206.693">
            <label>Justice William O. Douglas</label>
            <text syncTime="204.253" offset="817006">Wasn't the word there dwelling in the United States?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="leonard_b_sand" startTime="206.693" stopTime="794.774">
            <label>Mr. Leonard B. Sand</label>
            <text syncTime="206.693" offset="826723">There were two -- there were two aspects to that case, Mr. Justice Douglas.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.011" offset="848039">One, was whether she became naturalized by virtue of the naturalization of her father and the language in that provision was dwelling in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.611" offset="886387">But there was a second question in that case, which is closer to the question now before the Court and that was -- there was a statute of limitations which read in part, any alien who shall have entered or who shall be found in the United States in violation of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.767" offset="967053">And the question which was before the Court on that aspect of the case was whether this petitioner had entered or shall be found in or whether she was found in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.495" offset="1017940">And Mr. Justice Holmes, referring to the -- to the cases which even then had -- were of long standing, held that she was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.560" offset="1066214">This is the -- this is the perspective which Congress had when it enacted Section 212 (d) (5) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.786" offset="1107069">And that is the provision which provides that the Attorney General may in his discretion parole into the United States aliens who were applying for admission.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.648" offset="1154508">And then it goes on to provide in very explicit language.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.261" offset="1176973">I'm reading from page 3 of the -- of the brief of the respondent in Leng May Ma, when the purposes of such parole have in the opinion of the Attorney General -- when the purposes of such parole shall in the opinion of the Attorney General have been served, the alien shall forthwith return or be returned to the custody from whence he was paroled.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.791" offset="1275089">And thereafter, his case shall continue to be dealt with in the same manner as that of any other applicant for admission to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.471" offset="1329842">The legislative history of 212 (d) (5) indicates as --as the Act itself would indicate, that in considering Section 237 (a), which is the Section which the Government submits controls here.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.231" offset="1404865">One must read that statute in the light of 212 (d) (5).</text>
            <text syncTime="355.798" offset="1423151">Section 237 (a) provides that any alien who is excluded under this Act shall be immediately deported to the country whence he came, skipping some irrelevant traces, unless the Attorney General in an individual case in his discretion concludes that immediate deportation is not practicable or proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.770" offset="1514998">In other words, under 237 (a) as provided, the excluded alien shall be immediately sent back to the country from whence he came, unless the Attorney General decides that immediate action is not practical or proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.239" offset="1576856">The consequences of such a determination are spelled out in 212 (d) (5) because it is there provided, that following the period of parole, the status shall be that in the same manner as that of any other applicant for admission to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.823" offset="1647282">The status is the same as the alien had prior to the period of parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.150" offset="1668598">The legislative history of these statutes reinforces this.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.845" offset="1691376">In an earlier draft of the 1952 Act, the parole provision of 212 (d) (5) was limited to medical reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.993" offset="1723873">The statute gave the Attorney General power to parole only for medical reasons and the Immigration Service comments which occurrence to Congress -- excuse me -- to test the -- the rigidity of that provision and urge that there be placed in the statute a broader parole authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.623" offset="1810390">And with respect to Section 237 (a), the Service also made a comment with respect to parole and that appears at page 6 of the reply brief for the petitioner in the -- in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.306" offset="1885205">And the provision which the immigration suggested -- the Immigration Service suggested, read in pertinent part that following parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.149" offset="1936509">Whenever the Attorney General, in his discretion, concludes that deportation of an alien paroled under this subsection is practical or proper, the alien shall immediately be taken into custody under the outstanding order of exclusion and deportation, and shall be deported without further hearing in the same manner as other aliens who are excluded from the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.017" offset="2044029">In other words, it was explicitly provided in the suggested language of the Immigration Service with respect to the Section 237 that following parole, the alien shall be treated in the same manner as other aliens who are excluded from the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.611" offset="2114351">What Congress did in the 1952 Act, rather than have one parole provision in Section 237 (a) and another parole provision in 212 (d), it broadened the language of 212 (d) (5).</text>
            <text syncTime="545.444" offset="2181747">And since that Section dealt not only with excluded aliens but with all aliens who are seeking admission to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.679" offset="2218632">The language used was thereafter his case shall continue to be dealt with in the same manner as that of any other applicant for admission to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.928" offset="2255621">The status quo is retained and this is -- as counsel for petitioner in the prior case stated in response to a question from Mr. Justice Frankfurter, is merely a statutory recognition of what has been the immigration practice of this country in modern times, and that is that parole of an alien does not alter the immigration status.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.278" offset="2361051">Now in this case, in seeking to avoid this explicit statutory provision, counsel for the respondents emphasized that thereafter in 212 (d) (5).</text>
            <text syncTime="606.687" offset="2426671">It says thereafter, after the parole is terminated, he shall continue to be dealt with in the same manners as that of any other applicant for admission to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.415" offset="2469616">And so, they urge that it's true that once the parole is revoked the alien maybe treated as an excluded alien, but during the period in which parole continues the alien is within the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.799" offset="2535131">And I again, respectfully suggest to this Court that that is a concept which requires in the first instance a disregard of the past history and a disregard of -- of the intent of Congress, but it's a concept which is hostile to parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.857" offset="2611409">In other words, if the Immigration Service revoked the parole, brought all the aliens back into the detention center then they would be excluded aliens.But no purpose would be served by requiring the alien to return to physical detention while the immigration status is being determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.946" offset="2699703">There's a paradox in this case because one recalls the arguments that were made in Tom Wi Shang and the question was whether declaratory relief was available to an excluded alien or whether the only remedy was habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.311" offset="2753202">And once they are heard, counsel for the alien saying, Don't require the alien to go back into physical custody to have his immigration status determined.?</text>
            <text syncTime="700.730" offset="2802834">Precisely the opposite of the argument that is -- that is made in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.664" offset="2842645">Throughout the Immigration Act of 1952, one finds that Congress distinguished between excluded aliens and alien subject to deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.002" offset="2879948">Separate administrative processes are setup, separate grounds for exclusion and separate grounds for deportation are provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.845" offset="2923311">One cannot read the Immigration Act of 1952 in its entirety without recognizing the fact that this historic distinction in the treatment of aliens was retained in this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.666" offset="2994573">Now, the argument is made that Section 237 (a), which is the exclusion statute, applies only when the alien is immediately sent back to the country whence he came.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.106" offset="3040340">This was the basic reasoning of the -- of the Court of Appeals from the District of Columbia in the Chang case which is under the 1917 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.047" offset="3072104">They -- the Court of Appeals said that 237 (a) applied only where the return was immediate and that if the return was not immediate then the deportation provisions apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.482" offset="3137829">Respectfully submit, that that argument cannot be supported in light of the language of the -- of the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.401" offset="3173564">In succeeding provisions in --</text>

            <text syncTime="815.441" offset="3261753">Said there deportation within the meaning of 237 (a), it chooses that word, is not immediate and therefore the statute does not apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="853.597" offset="3414309">And the -- and the Service finds that the alien is not admissible and the alien -- it doesn't choose to have a board of special inquiry pass upon it and -- and literally immediately leaves.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.353" offset="3485362">If that construction in a literal requirement of immediate return is found to be a correct one then the power is placed in the hands of the alien to compel his admission into the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.628" offset="3574491">Because under Section 236 -- 236 (a) of the Immigration Act, an applicant for admission is entitled to have this case heard by a board of special inquiry and have a decision based on the records of those procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.738" offset="3638857">And he has a right of appeal to the Attorney General which operates his stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.875" offset="3659442">And so, that it is possible for the alien by -- by invoking these statutory procedures to which he is entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.657" offset="3694550">As -- as in these very cases to bring it about that he is not immediately sent back to the country from whence he came.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.267" offset="3729032">And therefore, under the -- under the reading of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, the alien simply by presenting himself at the gates and consisting in these procedures comes within the concept that aliens legally found in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.090" offset="3816281">But Judge Learned Hand has said that no alien can force -- can force us to admit him and surely it was not the intention of the Congress of the United States which passed the Immigration Act of 1952 to compress such a power upon the aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.628" offset="3898410">The -- the Chang case which was the -- the precedent on which the Court of Appeals of District of Columbia relied in this case is as I said previously a decision under the 1917 Act, which did not contain the phrase within the United States in the -- in the predecessor of Section 243 (h).</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.755" offset="4003004">And therefore, we submit distinguishable on those grounds and on the further grounds that there the aliens could not have gone back even if they wanted to, it was the United States which was keeping the aliens here, requiring them to be here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.592" offset="4094328">Reference is made in the case to the experience with respect to the Hungarian refugees during the -- in very recent times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.851" offset="4139363">And the fact that -- that parole under 212 (d) (5) is granted to many thousands of them and they were brought to this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.580" offset="4182309">But this doesn't establish as respondents would -- would have it established, that there is any absolute right of asylum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.850" offset="4231314">There was -- as to those aliens they were of course screened and the determination was made by the Immigration Service, which would be permitted entry into the United States under the reading of immediate which is given to the statute by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.155" offset="4316578">That power passes from the Congress and passes from the -- from the Immigration Service into the hands of the alien, and that of course is a result which Congress could not have intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.764" offset="4387004">Counsel for the respondents contend in an attempt to avoid the explicit language of the 1952 Act, that because for the respondents sought entry into the United States prior to the effective date of the 1952 Act, they are controlled by the provisions of the Act as it then existed, the 1917 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.158" offset="4500584">Under either the 1917 Act or the 1952 Act, these aliens were excludible and were subject to being sent back to the country from whence they came.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.717" offset="4550844">And so, there was no difference under either Act, with respect to that aspect of their status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.417" offset="4581564">But the claim is made that the applications for relief are governed not by the 1952 Act and by the language of 243 (h) deportation of any alien within the United States, but governed by the 1917 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.274" offset="4665051">We submit that under either Act the Attorney General had no power to act, but the -- but it is clear that an application for the withholding of deportation under 243 (h), like the -- like an application for suspension of deportation is a separate proceeding which is governed by the law in effect at the time the application was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.363" offset="4773407">And all the applications for relief in this case were made subsequent to the 1952 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.024" offset="4800052">And in fact, at the allegations and the complaints spell out, relief was sought only under the 1952 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.183" offset="4856686">In -- in short, the basic premise of the Government in this case is that Congress recognized the distinction between excluded aliens and aliens who were in the United States and was subject only to deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.688" offset="4930664">That Section 243 (h), into which Congress inserted the specific phrase within the United States has application only to aliens who are in the eyes of the law as well as in physical fact within the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.326" offset="5013211">That Congress would have had no other purpose in inserting the phrase within the United States in the provision, unless it was to make clear that it did not apply to excluded aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.401" offset="5069531">The Government further submits that the concept of parole, because here the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that the aliens were within the United States solely by virtue of the fact that they were paroled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.678" offset="5126687">That with disregard to parole Congress has explicitly stated what has been the long established law of immigration in this country, that parole does not alter the immigration status of the alien, that a great retains the status quo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.913" offset="5203592">And the Government respectfully submits that if that distinction is obliterated, if one looks only to the physical fact that the -- that the policy which is presently pursued by the Attorney General, which is to grant parole except where the alien is thought likely to abscond were to be a security risk, would have to be reevaluated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.168" offset="5312575">There were obviously have to be another consideration, which enters into the question of whether parole would be granted, and that consideration would be what alterations in the immigration status of the alien will result from this parole.</text>

            <text syncTime="2102.983" offset="8411847">Counsel in this case concede that they would not be within the United States and so there is the additional aspect to this argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="2131.452" offset="8525740">Whether the exercise of that power, which the Attorney General has to release or not to release the alien on parole will cause the immigration status of the alien to change.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.505" offset="8590002">Because if it does, we suggest, that that is a factor which has to be considered in determining whether or not to parole the alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.612" offset="8638380">And the policy which is now pursued of paroling all aliens except those thought likely to abscond were to be security risks would have to be reevaluated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.825" offset="8683207">And that is why as I said earlier there is the paradox in this case of counsel for the aliens urging a concept which is -- which is hostile to parole.</text>
