            <label>Mr. John N. Stull</label>
            <text syncTime="12.724" offset="50887">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.654" offset="66560">Where I stopped I -- in this hypothetical example of mine, I was sitting back with my royalty receiving $300 a year taxable to me as ordinary income with 27.5% -- percentage depletion tax free to me off the top.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.716" offset="138762">Of course the capital gain was a lot better because instead of deducting 27.5% off the top, they deduct 50% and the highest tax rate is only 25%.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.016" offset="196023">Now, I could have realized a capital gain by getting out of this deal completely and selling out my interest but I don't want to because this interest maybe more valuable than even the engineers say now that maybe that through these new methods of gas injection, and water flooding, and so on, that instead of a thousand barrels, that royalty may produce actually before the field is exhausted perhaps 1500 barrels.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.983" offset="311902">Furthermore, Texas is a prolific state and it may be that when this field is about exhausted, somebody will come along and draw much deeper and hit a whole new oil bearing sand.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.144" offset="360490">In that case I might discover that I've got 10,000 additional barrels applicable to this royalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.470" offset="385776">So I'm in a dilemma.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.791" offset="391105">I want a capital gain but I want to stay in.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.352" offset="409391">I want to get out but only out enough to get a capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.533" offset="426109">So what I do is use this device called the carved out oil payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.287" offset="453068">Now to return to my example, I think I'll get $300 a year every year for 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.686" offset="478668">I go around to X who is financially responsible or otherwise men.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.652" offset="502596">If he's not responsible, he can probably borrow the money because this is a good field and I tell him that for $580 cash that he'll give me $580 cash, I will assign to you X an oil payment which means that the -- while this oil payment is in effect, the pipeline company that is purchasing the oil and was sending those checks to me, monthly checks, as this oil was being produced, we'll now send those checks to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.739" offset="642926">I've got $580 cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.804" offset="651180">You will receive those checks until you've received enough -- enough checks to make $600 plus interest of 4%, we say.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.462" offset="697783">I'm certainly sure -- I'm reasonably sure that this will pay out on a little over two years, $600 plus whatever the interest is.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.644" offset="742504">Now the mechanics of this, the assignment is carried out by a formidable looking document by which I grant bargain, sell, transfer, assign, and convert my royalty interest to X until he has received $600 plus 4% interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.769" offset="823066">Thereafter, that assigned interest -- interest according to this instrument, terminates and the royalty reverts and revests in me.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.207" offset="860787">Its sign, sealed, delivered, and recorded.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.735" offset="870922">Because it's recorded, the pipeline company purchasing the oil stopped sending me the checks and sends them to my friend X until this temporary assignment terminates.</text>

            <text syncTime="290.053" offset="1160150">What I would like to go into, two of them, to illustrate that I'm not exaggerating this particular transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.228" offset="1188885">Let's take the O'Connor case.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.552" offset="1198184">This came up from the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.328" offset="1209260">In that case, the estate owned eight royalty interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.119" offset="1232457">It was reasonably estimated that the reserves of oil applicable to those eight interests were 23,150,000 barrels.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.715" offset="1278851">The estate transferred to one Blackburn a $10 million oil payment carved out of this -- these royalty interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.733" offset="1318870">The consideration paid for this $10 million oil payment was $9,990,350 plus 4% interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.972" offset="1367876">Apparently, Mr. Blackburn didn't have that much money so he borrowed it from the Chase Bank in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.466" offset="1393789">They sent their engineers down and decided to have plenty of reserves to cover the pay out of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.943" offset="1411762">He borrowed a 3.5% interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.123" offset="1424405">So everybody was happy on this transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.034" offset="1436108">Mr. Blackburn got $9650 which was the difference between the $10 million oil payment and the amount he paid $9,990,350, and he also got a half of percent interest which was during this pay out, which was the difference between what he paid the Chase Bank and what the estate paid him.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.923" offset="1531611">Now at the time of that transfer, it could be reasonably estimated and it shows in the record, that about 4 million barrels would be required to pay out that oil payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.371" offset="1569437">That is about 17% of the reserves and after he paid out, there would be $19,150,000 barrels left.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.614" offset="1602456">That oil payment paid out in three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.154" offset="1616562">After the three-year pay out, the pipeline company again started sending those checks to the estate or to the beneficiaries if they were distributed just as they had been sending them to the estate before this assignment was made.</text>

            <text syncTime="547.866" offset="2191464">Now the usual way of paying back that debt would be that this ordinary income would come in, depletion at 27.5% would be taken off the top, corporate tax paid on the remainder, and use the depletion tax free plus what's left over after the tax and the rest of it can pay off the note.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.942" offset="2267742">But P.G. Lake, Inc. assigned to P.G. Lake an oil payment for $600,000 plus 3% interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.448" offset="2313718">Now, since this was a working interest that the corporation owned, they could not assign as the O'Connor estate did the complete royalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.960" offset="2363768">Because that, the working interest has to pay the expenses of production.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.660" offset="2382576">And furthermore, I suppose that they didn't want to assign too much because they didn't want to run into the limitation on percentage depletion.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.415" offset="2409639">Percentage depletion is 27.5% of the gross but it's limited to 50% of the net.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.499" offset="2429910">And if they cut off too much of their income, they might have their expenses come up and cut down the percentage depletion.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.717" offset="2454779">So what they did was make this oil payment payable out of only 25% of the seven-eighths working interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.904" offset="2483513">In other words, they kept the other 75% of the working interest, got all the income from it but they assigned for this oil payment -- carved out oil payment transaction 25% of that working interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.774" offset="2543073">Now, at the time of that assignment if it would be reasonably estimated that the oil payment would pay out in about three years, and it did pay out in about three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.026" offset="2588003">Now, it seems to us that the taxpayers claim here that this lump sum consideration received for these assignments qualifies for the preferred treatment of 117 of the Internal Revenue Code just won't stand analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.549" offset="2662191">Under the ordinary principles of income tax law without putting aside for the moment some of the peculiarities of the tax law of oil and gas interests, we think that this was merely anticipating income that what the transaction was that the taxpayers own these mineral interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.221" offset="2748813">They were receiving the checks.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.562" offset="2754247">They had been receiving them from the pipeline companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.475" offset="2765845">They had been reporting them as ordinary income for a good many years for some of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.996" offset="2787892">They were doing it at that time and they could reasonably expect that that would happen in the future.</text>

            <text syncTime="793.964" offset="3175758">So I don't -- I've never heard of any of these oil payments running out.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.777" offset="3195089">Maybe some of the taxpayers, counsel here from taxes know more about it than I do.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.832" offset="3211285">Know about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.760" offset="3219017">Now we think that under the decisions of this Court that this is nothing but an assignment of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.120" offset="3244408">For instance, in the Horst case, decided by this Court in 1941, the taxpayer leased a building and the lease had eight years to run.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.918" offset="3291638">In consideration for cancellation of that lease, he received a lump sum.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.577" offset="3314207">He claimed it was a capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.010" offset="3324029">This Court said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.894" offset="3331553">That that was merely in lieu of the ordinary rent which he would have collected year after year over the rest of the term of the lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.190" offset="3360705">We think that's just the same thing here, that this lump sum cash payment is just the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.656" offset="3390589">It's in lieu of the ordinary royalty income subject to depletion.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.592" offset="3410338">And I want to emphasize that on these payments, the Commissioner does consider, thus get depletion deduction of all these taxes of the oil payment assignments.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.480" offset="3461851">Now, another analogy in the regular law without going to the oil and gas law, it seems to us, is the Watson case where this Court held that in 1953 that the sale of an orchard, an orange grove with unmatured crops on the trees.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.094" offset="3544294">In that situation, part of that sales price had to be allocated to the crops.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.344" offset="3569371">And therefore, it was taxable as ordinary income just as if the seller had kept the groves a little longer, picked the fruit, and sold it in one lump sum for over a period time himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.397" offset="3625587">Well the taxpayers here say that that type of case doesn't apply here because they've got oil, oils of peculiar animal.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.035" offset="3660069">Oil is both capital and its income.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.557" offset="3674175">Well, we can't say that that's a valid distinction because oil, when it's sold, you get a depletion allowance on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.883" offset="3711478">That takes care of you capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.347" offset="3717329">The only thing left is income.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.280" offset="3725061">The Commissioner has given these taxpayers their depletion allowance.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.921" offset="3743660">They're not being taxed on their capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.750" offset="3750975">All they did was assign their income.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.971" offset="3775843">Now I would like for a minute to turn to some of these oil cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.757" offset="3803011">Going back to that original leasing transaction I discuss at the outset, if you remember we had the landowner entering into a lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.172" offset="3848673">He retained the one-eighth royalty, seven-eighth of it was working interest and he received a cash bonus.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.112" offset="3888379">Now that exact situation was before this Court in 1932 in Burnet against Harmel.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.912" offset="3927562">The question there was whether there had been a sale of the oil and gas in place to the purchaser, the lessee in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.299" offset="3981166">If there had been a sale, this bonus, this cash bonus would have been taxed as capital gain, but this Court held otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.960" offset="4019827">They said that, “Yes, we can look to the law of the State of Texas,” and under the law of the State of Texas, we admit that this -- this leasing transaction actually convey title to all the minerals in place to the lessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.257" offset="4096940">That this Circuit, just as they did in this case, held in Harmel that because under state law, all right, title and interest to the minerals went to the lessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.854" offset="4139363">It was therefore a capital transaction for federal income tax purposes and the bonus was taxed as capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.785" offset="4175099">This Court disagreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.919" offset="4183667">It said that we have to look to state law to determine the interest to the party but we look to the federal income tax statutes and the statute there was a predecessor of Section 117 with which we're concerned here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.152" offset="4256601">And they said that under that it was not intended by Congress that a transaction such as this should result in capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.543" offset="4294113">Further decisions of this Court such as Palmer against Bender which involved a bonus in a subleasing transaction, pointed out that this lump sum bonus consideration was merely a substitute for and in lieu of ordinary income, ordinary royalty income which would be received by the taxpayers over a period of years, it was really an anticipation of that income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.253" offset="4420963">Therefore, it was of exactly the same type of that income and taxable exactly of that income would have been taxed when it was received.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.619" offset="4470387">The Court specifically stated that the bonus was a return pro tanto of the plaintiff's capital investment in the oil in anticipation of its extraction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.336" offset="4517303">Now, we think that exactly the same thing applied here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.995" offset="4531931">What we have is a taxpayer within continuing economic interest in the minerals in place, a royalty, overriding royalty, a working interest whatever it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.868" offset="4587416">What he does is sell in anticipation that is in anticipation of what he will receive as ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.128" offset="4636421">Part of that ordinary income for a lump sum consideration just as the lessor in Harmel did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.646" offset="4670485">We think that those principles are exactly applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.147" offset="4684487">We can't find any distinction between those two cases at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="1524.117" offset="6096457">If one of these assignments is a substantial part of their interest, then, we should say capital gain.</text>

            <text syncTime="1562.239" offset="6248908">So perhaps if it come -- came down to a question of fact, we'd have to find out about those.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.021" offset="6276075">But we don't think that the Court ever need reach this substantial business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.392" offset="6293525">We think our first two arguments completely answer any argument that the taxpayers made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.841" offset="6315363">Furthermore, if you get into the substantial versus insubstantial business, we think it's almost impossible to administer because that oil is under the branch, you can't get down and see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.950" offset="6359771">You just have to take the best engineering estimates.</text>

            <text syncTime="1669.354" offset="6677316">Now, the taxpayers have a claim of a foul here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.588" offset="6698318">They say that the Commissioner applied this -- these deficiencies retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.492" offset="6729874">It seems to me we've been through all these, the Automobile Club case but some of them still seem to push it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.249" offset="6756937">All these transactions -- the earliest of these transactions was in December of 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.624" offset="6782433">The first published ruling that I know about as to the taxation of these oil payments occurred in 1946 in which the general -- the general counsel of this Treasury published a GCM in which he said that short lives oil payments were not qualified as capital assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.093" offset="6876369">He said ordinarily these are one or two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.839" offset="6895282">From this, these taxpayers argue that in the Weed case, this thing paid out in two years and four months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.337" offset="6921300">They say this GCM said one or two years so they didn't catch us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.663" offset="6942616">Some of the others paid out in three years, others paid out in four and five.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.138" offset="6960483">Of course, the payout period doesn't mean very much because if you always sign a very small part of your interest, it will take a much longer time to pay out than if you're in a position to assign your whole interest for a much shorter time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.174" offset="7024640">Anyway, that ruling on which they relied specifically stated, that no opinion is expressed with respect to the status of oil payments extending over a substantial portion of the depletable interest from which product.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.973" offset="7095798">I think that any taxpayer who relied on that and now claims a foul was a little out of line on relying on that particular assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.063" offset="7144176">In 1950, the Commissioner again ruled that the experience from 46 to 50, it showed that there was no possible basis to figure out the difference between a short-lived and -- and a long-lived oil payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.292" offset="7201123">So therefore he was going to give up any idea and he had expressed from the first that there might be possibly later on come out with some idea of a distinction between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.637" offset="7250547">Now I stated at the beginning that there is another question involved in the Fleming case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.258" offset="7276983">In the Fleming case, these assignments were not laid for cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.772" offset="7299030">They were made for real estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.365" offset="7313450">We think that it's impossible to distinguish between cash and real estate in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.886" offset="7347513">But the taxpayers say that this is a tax-free exchange under Section 112 (b) (1) of the Internal Revenue Code which is quoted on pages 54 and 55 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.274" offset="7401012">That says that no gain or loss should be recognized if property held for productive use in the trade or business or for investment not including the stock and trade or other property held primarily for sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.927" offset="7455660">It's exchange solely for property of a light count to be held either for productive use and trade or business or for investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.512" offset="7485962">Now we can't see that this oil payment is that type of property in that statute anymore than its property under Section 117.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.795" offset="7527131">We think that the oil payment is merely an assignment of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.012" offset="7543954">It's an anticipatory assignment of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.346" offset="7553358">Therefore, it can't be like property to an office building in Fort Worth or a ranch out in Texas somewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.029" offset="7604036">In conclusion, I just want to say that I think that these devices, while they maybe well recognized under the Law of Texas, I realize that there are other situations where the oil payment has a use in the oil industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.614" offset="7678433">I won't get in to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.143" offset="7684493">We're not attacking that particular type, we're attacking a carved out oil payment which is carved out temporarily from a larger interest which interest is retained by the assignor whether he goes through the mechanics of assigning it to the assignee with the reversion back or whether he just carves out a partial interest in it and really keeps it himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.268" offset="7797029">We don't think that that makes any difference.</text>

            <text syncTime="2000.046" offset="8000157">And if I may, I will follow his lead although the question which he termed subsidiary was the question upon which we won below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.557" offset="8046132">That is that the exchange of these oil payments or other real estate was nontaxable under the expressed terms of Section 112 (b) (1) of the 1939 Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.128" offset="8120424">As we see the matter, the Commissioner is trying to exercise what is clearly a legislative prerogative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.727" offset="8166818">There is much more to this question than counsel indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.438" offset="8197747">The capital gain provisions were introduced in 1921.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.826" offset="8219272">As far as this question is concerned, there has been no change from 1921 down through the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.003" offset="8271935">From 1921 until 1946, it was the consistent practice of the Internal Revenue Service to treat the carving out and sale of an oil payment as productive of capital gain if the holding period of the property was present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.627" offset="8374439">Counsel said that the first published ruling was in 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.512" offset="8402024">I call attention to one in 1941 which is quoted in my brief on page 111, the latter part of the italicized portion there, expressly holds that the carving out of an oil payment is a sale of an interest in the property as to which gain is calculated in the ordinary way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.096" offset="8488333">Not only was that the position of the Commissioner during which time we've had I'd say 20 reenactments of the -- a capital gain provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.601" offset="8538384">It was the position of the courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2220.192" offset="8880692">And it was expressly held, I believe, Judge McCord, I believe, wrote the opinion and in the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.449" offset="8917786">I've forgotten the author in the Tax Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.982" offset="8927922">It was expressly held in that case that it was a sale of an interest in the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.107" offset="8956343">Perhaps there are other cases to the same effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.239" offset="8972852">In the reply brief that was handed to me just before the Court convened today, it stated, I believe, that there's a difference in the Ortiz case because the proceeds from the sale of that oil payment were paid for the development.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.835" offset="9035337">I -- I do not believe the record supports that statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.735" offset="9086851">With that long history before us -- before the Bureau of Internal Revenue with the Ortiz case and perhaps other cases, and I would say an unlimited number of private rulings where they've held that the carving out and the sale of oil payments produced long-term capital gain other conditions being present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.998" offset="9187892">The general counsel of the Internal Revenue Service in 1946 ruled at a short-lived oil payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.249" offset="9232927">One that ordinarily paid out in one or two years produced ordinary depletable income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.991" offset="9259886">Now although that was directly contrary to Ortiz and their previous practice, the only case that they cited there was a case where a man sold a declared dividend on stock and kept the stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.005" offset="9319967">And they expressly said there that Horst and known other cases were not pertinent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.104" offset="9348389">The -- this Court held in 1937 that where an oil lease or leases were assigned with an informal retention of an oil payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.740" offset="9414949">A part of the lease was sold and a part of it retained, so that the assignee who was before the Court in that case, Thomas versus Perkins, so that the assignee could not be required to report as a part of his income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.381" offset="9489450">The oil applicable to that retained all payment interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.576" offset="9510243">That was a very informal agreement as contrasted with the formality in which not barrels of oil, not a right to collect from the pipeline or so but an interest in an oil and gas lease which entitles them to a certain right in that and limits it by dollars when as and if produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.766" offset="9622988">The -- you take the Ortiz case and the Perkins case and the uniform holdings that whoever has an economic interest in property is entitled to depletion on the income from that property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.324" offset="9705221">That is the income relating to that depletion, to that interest and must be report it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.450" offset="9749734">And the definition frequently reiterated, I believe, the last was in Southwest Exploration case, that anyone who must look solely to oil or gas and same is true of any other members when as and if produced for the recovery of his investment as a depletable economic interest which is ownership in the Perkins case, in quoting from Palmer versus Bender, this Court said that ownership was essential.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.761" offset="9887033">Now, counsel has not tried to tell this Court why it is that a retained oil payment is a different character of interest from a carved out oil payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.125" offset="9936457">He hasn't tried to tell the Court, although he very frankly and properly admits, that if the man in his original example that had the thousand barrel royalty, if he sold that entire royalty, Mr. Stull would have given him capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.236" offset="9984940">If he sold an undivided tenth interest in it, he would have given him capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.306" offset="10009182">If he sold the most minutes of fraction as long as it extended for the economic life of the property, he would have gotten capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.346" offset="10065293">But the -- in 1946, they discovered there was a difference in property pending on how you carved it out and how long it lasts and so forth in the hands of the purchaser rather than in the hands of the seller.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.319" offset="10129241">Now in 19 -- in 1948, I believe it was, to show what the practice was before, the Bureau ruled at this, I.T. 24 of the 1946 General Counsel Memorandum would not be applied retroactively to transactions before April 1, 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.202" offset="10248777">Just in the Leslie Salt case, I think that is conclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.997" offset="10263928">Referring to that date, the Commissioner recognized transactions as we say that he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.182" offset="10300709">That situation went on until 1950 when the Commissioner said that he was no longer able to distinguish between the practical or legal effect of short-time or long-term oil payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.587" offset="10366328">And therefore, again, without any further authority, they would all be treated as producing ordinary depletable income.</text>

            <text syncTime="2641.225" offset="10564859">The -- it was in 1948, I believe, where he said he wouldn't apply that retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.427" offset="10585652">Then in 1950, he went all the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.854" offset="10599340">Now, two of our transactions, one was 1948, and one 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.810" offset="10619193">Those were the transactions involved in the Fleming case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.959" offset="10631732">Now we say that under the Leslie Salt Company case, he had no right to change a position which had been repeatedly approved by reenactment of the statute which had been approved by the courts and which is entirely different from the Automobile Club of Michigan case where it was more or less of a private ruling which everybody admit it was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.581" offset="10742282">The only person that's ever said this was wrong is the Government since 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.155" offset="10772584">The (Inaudible) case on which their petition for certiorari was predicated, held that it was essentially alone so that the assignor of the oil payment was taxable as the oil was produced and applied to the oil payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.146" offset="10848549">We don't think that's right but if it is right, may -- and that's what they got certiorari on the conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.586" offset="10878328">If it is right, then, most of these cases go out the window because the year of production is not before the Court or substantive time of the year of the production.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.913" offset="10927647">I believe some of the Fleming oil payments and by the way some of them lasted or still lasting, they -- they have an expected life for 10 or 12 years made in 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.339" offset="10997342">Judge Hutcheson in one of his opinions below said that perhaps the most startling example of the Commissioner's prerogative -- presumed prerogative to legislate was with respect to the depletion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.971" offset="11059827">Now this Court has held in Twin Bell Oil Syndicate that you can't have a double depletion allowance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.361" offset="11093368">This Court has held that everyone who must look to oil when as and if produced is entitled to depletion on that oil when as and if produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.856" offset="11147389">So this people who acquired these oil payments cannot be denied depletion with respect to their income during the lives of these oil payments, but the Commissioner in the face of his success in the Ortiz case where it was held that the carved or outer was not entitled to depletion said, “Oh yes, you're entitled to it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.905" offset="11271523">And he just changes the holding of this Court and holdings of every court that's ever passed on it by saying out of where this depletion deduction on the sale of a capital asset.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.859" offset="11327425">And it's the only time in the history of depletion that it's ever been done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.006" offset="11348010">And it -- as I say, it thwarts the -- the ruling of this Court in Helvering versus Twin Bell Oil Syndicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.610" offset="11378416">Now, there's a footnote from page 37 of the Government's brief, Footnote 17, which says that -- well the first thing you do you -- the oil payment purchaser recovers his cost and then he gets depletion -- percentage depletion on his excess.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.910" offset="11451559">Well that is not now and has never been the practice of the Bureau of Internal Revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.291" offset="11477159">You just can't get that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.727" offset="11482906">And if you could get it, it would be absolutely contrary because you'd be getting cost depletion isn't plus -- plus percentage depletion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.200" offset="11516761">You don't get your capital back as oil is produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.142" offset="11532539">You have no right to get your capital back as oil is produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.843" offset="11547272">This Court held that under the 1913 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.078" offset="11568274">You only get what Congress says you can get and they say you can get either cost depletion, they say now that you can only get cost depletion or percentage depletion but you cannot get both.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.183" offset="11616653">The necessary effect of their contention, the -- nobody in the Internal Revenue Service or no court would or could deny the oil payment holder depletion on its proceeds is to allow the forbidden double deduction for depletion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.633" offset="11698469">Now those aims are very closely connected because depletion and income go together and income and ownership go together.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.460" offset="11741832">This people did contest, didn't get an order on the pipeline, they got a deed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.283" offset="11761058">And they had the right to have that oil delivered to them at the top -- on top of the ground without expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.664" offset="11790629">They could sell it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.542" offset="11794077">They could give it away or do anything they wanted to with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.628" offset="11810482">And if it -- well, it didn't happen to be present and Mr. Stull's geology is a little better than a lot of people because he says you can't tell all about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.650" offset="11850501">The people to finance McCarthy, the Bank Insurance Company will be glad to have had him at the appropriate time.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Paul Jackson</label>
            <text syncTime="3797.146" offset="15188532">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3801.525" offset="15206087">As I see it, the Court has three courses open to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3805.754" offset="15223014">That is based upon the prior administrative history of sale to carved out oil payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3812.390" offset="15249554">Now to run over briefly, this legislative history to fill a few gaps that were omitted by Mr. Weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3818.589" offset="15274318">It is entirely true as he has said that for 25 years following the enactment of the capital gain provisions in 1921, it was the consistent practice of the Treasury Department to recognize that the sale of carved out oil payments, whether they'd be long or be short, would be entitled to capital gain treatment under 1921 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3841.962" offset="15367837">There are rulings to that effect and many private rulings wish to that effect and that was the position affirmatively taken by the Government in several cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3852.955" offset="15411722">In 1946, as Mr. Weeks has said, detecting what was conceived to be a defect in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3861.995" offset="15447980">And instead of going to Congress, they sought to cure this defect administratively.</text>
            <text syncTime="3867.245" offset="15468878">And that 1946 ruling provided that as to short term oil payment or short-lived oil payments as distinguishable on long-lived oil payments, that is oil payment stated to be one or two years in length.</text>
            <text syncTime="3879.545" offset="15518093">They should be treated as assignments of income and taxed at normal rates and denied capital gain treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3886.426" offset="15545678">That ruling was made prospective in its operation because it represented a change of existing policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3892.932" offset="15571696">In 1949, that same ruling was extended to donative assignments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3897.633" offset="15590504">That is when one gave an oil payment to a member of his family.</text>
            <text syncTime="3902.669" offset="15610671">If the oil payment was short-lived, as distinguished from long-lived, that was held to be an assignment of income and not a donation of property producing income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3914.070" offset="15656229">That again was made prospective in its operation in the Nail case which had involved the donation of an oil payment and which had been held to be, by the Tax Court or the Tax Appeals then to be a gift of property and not a gift of income and which the Treasury had acquiesced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3932.387" offset="15729476">That acquiescence was withdrawn and not a ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3937.689" offset="15750687">Thereafter, it was made prospecting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3939.608" offset="15758420">Now in 1950 for the first time they extended these two prior rulings to cover all oil payments no matter how long in duration or no matter how short in duration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3953.827" offset="15815262">All oil payments, oil due to large interest, if sold, were held to be sales of income and if given away were held to be gifts of ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3965.883" offset="15863432">When the Fifth Circuit in the Caldwell case refused to accept I.T. 4003, that's the 1950 ruling, the Government then receded from this extreme position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3979.167" offset="15916617">And in the Hawn case and again in the cases below, went back to its original ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3985.263" offset="15940963">Their position was that the Caldwell case was right that I.T. 4003 the extreme rule was wrong and they urged for the insubstantial transfer rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3994.908" offset="15979624">That is, if the transfer was insubstantial in relation to the reversion, it would be held to be an assignment of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="4003.335" offset="16013270">If it were substantial, it was deemed to be a sale of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="4009.232" offset="16036885">Here, they take the alternative position.</text>
            <text syncTime="4013.246" offset="16052976">First they are going back for the I.T. 4003 and holding that all oil payments, carved out of a large increase no matter how long in duration should be treated as assignments of income as anticipations of income and tax to normal rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="4028.488" offset="16113894">That will include the 12-year oil payment in the Fleming case the 13-year oil payment in the Caldwell case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4036.103" offset="16144405">(Inaudible) say, if the oil payment is insubstantial in relation to this reversion, then, the -- an insubstantial one should be taxed as an assignment of income and the substantial one at capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="4050.161" offset="16200620">Now, there are three courses open to the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4054.930" offset="16219638">First, you can take the extreme view published first in 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="4060.982" offset="16243879">Since repudiated below, review of I.T. 4003 which is, that all oil payments, no matter how long in duration shall be treated as assignments of income and taxed at normal rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="4074.694" offset="16298736">Secondly, you can go back to the other extreme and you can contend a whole, that all oil payments, when sold, no matter how short in duration or sales of property, sales of real property, when Congress intended such to enjoy, the capital gain benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="4093.865" offset="16375432">That would be the rule in effect for 25 years until the change was made in 1946, or you can take the middle ground and hold the insubstantial oil payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="4105.412" offset="16421616">Those that are insubstantial in relation to the reversion or interest or to the interest kept, or truly, by applying some extension of the Horst principle, or truly assignments of income but those that are substantial shall be treated as sales of durable substantial property rights and to be given capital gain treatments.</text>
            <text syncTime="4125.064" offset="16500193">That is the Government's alternative view at least the alternative view set forth from its brief and it's a view that it urged below.</text>
            <text syncTime="4132.499" offset="16529972">Now, first, is the extreme view of I.T. 4003 right?</text>
            <text syncTime="4141.183" offset="16564663">We submit on any basis that view which is the Government's primary view is clearly wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="4148.813" offset="16595174">That view would hold that every oil payment, no matter how long its life or how substantial, is to be treated as an assignment of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="4159.404" offset="16637597">Now, first, I think we should look to the committee reports and those ways and means of the Senate Finance Committee Report in connection with the enactment of the capital gain provisions in 1921.</text>
            <text syncTime="4177.212" offset="16708754">Those committee reports stated clearly that sales of farms, mineral properties, I repeat, mineral properties, and other capital assets have been recorded by virtue of the high surtax rates applicable to such sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="4197.824" offset="16791197">Such sales have been deterred and the purpose of the capital gain rates was to omit such transactions, sales have been on properties including others to go forward without the payment of tax are represented by the surtax rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="4216.076" offset="16864235">Now, an oil payment, as Mr. Weeks has said and as the case has hold, an oil payment is a creature of the Texas oil men, men from the oil states which was an interest in property long before we had a capital gain provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4228.911" offset="16915644">The uses of oil payments as set forth in our brief and I mean for the Court with that now.</text>
            <text syncTime="4234.323" offset="16937273">But they are mineral property.</text>
            <text syncTime="4238.194" offset="16952738">To tax a long-term oil payment, a 12-year oil payment would be to create the very hardship at what -- at which the capital gain sections of the law were directed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4250.638" offset="17002475">Namely, it would produce an excessive surtax on the profits of a number of years, the bunching of income of 10, 12, 15 years in a single year which the very hardship that Congress was aiming at when it enacted the capital gain provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4272.904" offset="17091605">The Government itself admits that an oil payment is a mineral property and moreover, that an oil payment is a capital asset.</text>
            <text syncTime="4283.549" offset="17134132">The I.T. 4003, which is the basis of their case or their primary contention, says specifically that if a taxpayer owns an oil payment and sells it in its entirety or sells the fraction of it extending over the life of the property, he has sold the capital asset.</text>

            <text syncTime="4336.093" offset="17344366">I would concede to the said argument although in this general neighborhood is not well developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4344.397" offset="17377489">That he sale by me to a third party, well first, a prepayment of rent is clearly ordinary income to me by prepay -- if you prepay me two years rent, I must take up those two years in a single year and tax at normal rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="4359.959" offset="17439765">It's not a capital gain transaction, I admit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4362.942" offset="17451677">If I should sell rents in the future to a third party or if I should sell dividends on stock that I own to a third party for cash, if I should sell one or two years coupons on a bond, I think my own belief is, all the cases are not clear on this, that I have sold income.</text>
            <text syncTime="4385.915" offset="17543628">I have anticipated income and what I get is simply a substitution of what I would have gotten, had I not sold the coupon or sold the future rent, or sold the dividends?</text>
            <text syncTime="4396.691" offset="17586678">I think I have normal income and not capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="4400.569" offset="17602247">Conceded that, however, does not mean and here we get to a very important point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4406.395" offset="17625548">It does not mean that an oil payment for that oil property or that oil income for that matter is like income from other property, income by way of dividends from stock or interest on a coupon or found on a bond or rent from real estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4427.509" offset="17709976">When oil in the ground is real property, each barrel of oil in the ground is real property.</text>

            <text syncTime="4668.345" offset="18673371">Now, if we are going to say that when you sell an oil payment, you would be taxed at normal rates because you have simply anticipated income then that means that on the sale of any mineral property whether it would be a royalty, whether it would be a lease, or whether it would be a working interest, or an oil payment, and you sell any property outright or fractional interest in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4696.216" offset="18784862">In a sense, you by virtue of that sale, anticipating income, you are getting today a price for that which had you not made the sale would have all been income to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="4708.744" offset="18834913">And yet since 1921, the cases all hold and the Bureau's position and the Treasury position is solid that when you sell an entire interest or a fractional interest, you have sold the capital asset.</text>
            <text syncTime="4725.381" offset="18901473">As the Court said in the America case, if that were not true, then, the language of the committee report is meaningless.</text>

            <text syncTime="4766.448" offset="19065731">We conceive then that this oil payment is like a coin -- a coin.</text>

            <text syncTime="4784.194" offset="19136679">And on the other side, it's clearly inscription that this is indeed a mineral property.</text>

            <text syncTime="4796.202" offset="19184744">It's a depletable property, and it's this dual characteristic that causes us the problem here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4801.969" offset="19207837">Now, if we're to meet that problem by saying every sale, every carved out oil payment irrespective of life, is to be treated as assignment of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="4813.284" offset="19253081">We get into some absurdities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4818.136" offset="19272516">Take for example the 12-year life oil payment against which there is remaining two-year life in the form of a reversion or interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4827.379" offset="19309505">Can it be said that when that oil payment is covered up for the 12-year life representing perhaps 90% of the oil in place which you have anticipated income that -- that is the sale of the fruits from a tree, that the Horst case has got any application whatever, that the -- that the corpus that produces this income is the two-year remaining residual life of this property the 10% that's left.</text>
            <text syncTime="4853.774" offset="19415040">Isn't it clear that what you have done is that you've sold a substantial -- a large part of your mineral property and you've anticipated income only in the sense that any sale, any mineral property is an anticipation of income.</text>

            <text syncTime="5645.741" offset="22582962">That oil -- the only other thing I have to say is that I haven't heard any answer to our Harmel argument that this is just exactly like the Harmel case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5654.847" offset="22619324">This depletion argument -- depletion, the Southwest Exploration decision of this Court said that the depletion was to take care of returning to the owner of one of these economic interests as capital investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5668.910" offset="22675540">We're not trying to tax depletion, to tax that capital investment.That's exactly what this allowance is for.</text>
            <text syncTime="5677.254" offset="22708976">As far as the oil in kind goes, I -- I had not experience with these oil deals to know that every oil deal allows every participant to get his oil in kind if he wants it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5691.310" offset="22765192">I don't think anybody ever gets.</text>
            <text syncTime="5693.259" offset="22773029">A barrel of crude oil in New York is pretty hard to dispose of.</text>
            <text syncTime="5698.324" offset="22793195">What happened here is whether there's a right to the oil in kind or whether it's a cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="5703.819" offset="22815242">It is that there was a cash came in and cash was paid to the pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="5708.750" offset="22834991">And the Harmel case said that the Texas oil lease conveyed the right to the oil and gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="5717.701" offset="22870727">That's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="5718.803" offset="22875115">But they said that is not a capital gains transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5722.600" offset="22890371">Well that right is conveyed at the wellhead or was conveyed in the grounds and not a capital gains transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5728.923" offset="22915657">And therefore, they said that that bonus was taxable as ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="5733.657" offset="22934570">It wasn't a capital transaction.</text>
