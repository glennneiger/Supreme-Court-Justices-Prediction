            <text syncTime="88.602" offset="354325">The -- this case is here on writ of certiorari for the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.916" offset="387657">Broadly speaking, it deals with the respective rights under the National Labor Relations Act of the employer, his employees to distribute literature concerning unionization within the plant where the employees work.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.876" offset="463412">As I shall state and create a detail in a moment, it is fairly well settled under the statute that an employer may normally, lawfully forbid his employees from distributing union literature within the plant, without regard to working or non-working time.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.539" offset="538122">And our problem here is whether the employer forfeits his right if he as long as if, and as long as he himself distributes his own literature concerning unionization while at the same time forbidding his employees from distributing literature within the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.618" offset="626416">Stated in the language of the statute, the question is whether the employer's prohibition of the distribution of union literature by his employees in these circumstances constitutes, interference, unlawful interference under the statute with the employees', Section 7 right, the right to engage in concerted activities for their mutual aid and protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.964" offset="723801">The facts which give rise to this issue it can be stated quite briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.443" offset="741669">In 1953, the respondent, Steelworkers Union began an -- a drive to organize the employees of the NuTone Company, the employer involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.411" offset="793600">NuTone Company has applied within the City of Cincinnati, Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.841" offset="815334">The organizing drive culminated in election before the Board to determine whether the employees wish to be represented by the Steelworkers or not and the union then lost that election.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.893" offset="859533">When the organizing drive that the Steelworkers got underway, the company posted notices in the plant notifying the employees that it was against the company's rules to pose or distribute literature of any kind under company's premises and farther that this prohibition would apply, not only to those who favor the union but those who are also opposed to the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.584" offset="978233">The -- prior -- prior to the pre-election period, the company itself had never deemed to self-bound by this rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.340" offset="1021283">It had posted notices, distributed literature for its own purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="266.406" offset="1065587">That literature, giving notices to the employees concerning various matters that -- that would have been of interest to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.693" offset="1098710">Actually the record does not show the kind of literature that the company was -- or notices that's -- that were -- the company was posting prior to the election period.</text>

            <text syncTime="293.561" offset="1174152">Now, after as I say the union-organizing drive got under way, the union began to distribute its own literature in the public area, in front of the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.955" offset="1223784">And the company in turn distributed its literature within the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.292" offset="1245100">Now, this literature reflected there's no doubt about it, the company's rather strong opposition to the issue but there's no question here that the contents of the literature were within the permissible limits of free speech under the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="333.008" offset="1331931">The -- on these facts, the Board found that the employer's prohibition against the employees distributing literature within the plant, even though the employer was simultaneously distributing his anti-union literature, anti-union but non-coercive literature within the plant did not constitute a violation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.304" offset="1417195">The court below while acknowledging that the question was not entirely free of difficulties disagreed with the Board and held that the employer's action this prohibition against the distribution literature by his employees while he himself distributed his own literature constituted a violation of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="563.709" offset="2254785">Namely, the employer's proprietary interest and control over his property as against the employees' right to engage in concerted activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.980" offset="2295850">The heart of the respondent's case here is, that the statute confers upon the employees, an absolute right to engage in either oral solicitation for union purposes or to distribute literature for such purposes and that the only restrictions which may be placed upon the exercise of this right on the employer's premises must find their justification in considerations and must find their -- their justification only again, considerations of the efficiency and production.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.743" offset="2422909">And the argument further runs that such a showing has not and could not be made in this case since the employer himself had distributed literature in the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.795" offset="2467109">The Court please, we believe that the argument starts from to broader a premise.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.028" offset="2488111">Secondly, that it overlooks what we regard as significant distinctions, differences between all union solicitation and the distribution of literature.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.945" offset="2523742">And finally, that the argument fails to accord the proper way to Section 8 (c) of the statute which provides that the -- that the decimation of the non-coercive views shall not be an unfair labor practice or constitute evidence of an unfair labor practice under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.306" offset="2609215">We think that the basic guide post which will lead us to arriving at a correct solution of this problem was expressed by this Court in the Babcock &amp; Wilcox case.Babcock &amp; Wilcox case which came up before this Court some two years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.562" offset="2694165">In that case the Court will recall, the problem was whether nonemployee union organizers were entitled to go on the employer's parking lot for the purpose of reaching the employees in distributing literature to them on the parking lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.476" offset="2757904">And in the course of that opinion that this Court said that -- and we think this is the basic test that will solve this problem, the problems of this character.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.450" offset="2805760">The Court said there, “This is not a problem of always open or always closed door for union organization on company property.” Organization rights are granted to workers by the same authority, the National Government that preserves copyrights.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.921" offset="2867618">Accommodation between the two must be obtained where there's little destruction of one as is consistent with the maintenance of the other and we think that the accommodation which the Board has made in this case achieves this accommodation between the two interests where there's little infringement or abridgment of one as -- as of the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.311" offset="2969182">Let me explain it.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.163" offset="2984647">Traditionally, labor organizations had used two types of techniques for the purpose of organizing.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.123" offset="3016411">One of them is oral solicitation and the other one is the distribution of literature because these two techniques do differ in character they have received different treatment under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.415" offset="3065626">And I believe we must look to the consideration which underlie the different treatment accorded the two in order to come to what I -- what we think is the correct solution of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.884" offset="3103451">And I might say, incidentally, while-- while this case involves the distribution of union literature, the succeeding case involves all the union solicitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.826" offset="3143262">Now, with respect to oral union solicitation, the rule is fairly well-established under the statute that an employer may prohibit the employees from engaging in such solicitation during working time but that he may not prohibit his employees from engaging such -- such oral solicitation during nonworking time at the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.276" offset="3229048">Now, that rule accomplishes a twofold purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.423" offset="3241691">It -- for on one hand, it protects the employer's interest in the efficient running of his plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.314" offset="3265202">On the other hand, it makes available to the employees for purposes of union, oral union solicitation to the plant.The plant has been regarded as uniquely appropriate for this purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.097" offset="3312327">And because it is so uniquely appropriate for this purpose if we had a broad prohibition which restricted employees all together, from access to the plant even during a nonworking time for purposes of oral solicitation, such a rule would place a serious impediment in the employees' effective exercise of their rights under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.002" offset="3387977">On the other hand, by restricting the right of the employees to engage in such oral solicitation, only with -- during their nonworking time, it protects the employer's interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.737" offset="3434893">It protects the employer's interest in the efficient running of his plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.191" offset="3452761">The accommodation which has been worked out with respect to oral solicitation thus preserves the employer's interest in the efficient running his plant and at the same time does not impede the employees' organizing activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.516" offset="3510021">Now, with respect to the distribution of literature which is our case, not here, a different rule has been evolved under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.198" offset="3548787">With respect to the distribution of such literature, it is established under the statute that an employer may normally and lawfully forbid his employees from distributing such literature within the plant, without regard to whether it's within -- during working time or nonworking time.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.072" offset="3628199">The accommodation which has been worked out has been explained sometimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.727" offset="3670831">In fact, the court below explained it on this basis that the employer's interest in keeping his plant clean, preventing literally, is sufficiently great to override the employees' interest or their -- their right to distribute -- whatever right they might have otherwise, to distribute literature within the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.350" offset="3757349">The court below relying upon these basics for the rule against the distribution of literature in effect said, that once the employer has distributed literature, he has destroyed the basis of the rules, namely, littering.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.450" offset="3813773">Now, we submit Your Honors, that while the -- littering, the problem of littering is an important consideration that underlies the rule against the distribution of literature within the plant that the rule has a much broader basis than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.269" offset="3881064">The -- the distinguishing characteristic of literature is the fact that iy carries a permanent message and it is intended to be read by the recipient at his convenience and that purpose is served.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.994" offset="3943967">If there exists outside the plant, adequate avenues for distribution to the various employees.It can be sent to the employees through the mails.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.057" offset="3984196">It can be handed to the employees just as readily when they enter -- come into the plant or leave the plant as when they are within the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.221" offset="4016797">Indeed in this case, the union distributed literature in front of the plant and there is no suggestion that the union was incurring any difficulties in -- in distributing or reaching the employees with this literature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.795" offset="4063086">And as I've already indicated, Mr. Justice Burton's question, the union did not ask for permission to distribute literature within the plant, which suggests that the union was not experiencing any serious difficulties.</text>

            <text syncTime="1769.013" offset="7076049">In those cases, of course, this Court has frequentness and these two occasions said that the -- that the employees must be accessible not only to fellow employees but to outside organizers as well in order to make effective use of the exercise of their rights under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.565" offset="7142191">Now, continuing with Section 8 (c), normally, of course, Section 8 (c) has significant -- significance with respect to that contents of the message.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.940" offset="7187749">But we think that the legislative history of Section 8 (c) indicates that Congress meant to go beyond just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.894" offset="7211572">Prior to the enactment of Section 8 (c), the Board had held that an employer committed a violation of the statute if he used his own premises merely to air his own none-coercive views with respect to the unionization of his employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.353" offset="7273326">And the Board's view then was, that by the mere utilization of his property for that purpose, that that gave a -- his message which is in itself contain no threats, no promises about it, but the mere utilization of his property gave his message a coercive thrust in violation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.642" offset="7342498">And again later on, but again before enactment of Section 8 (c), the Board had held that where the employer required his employees to listen to him during company time, that that was a violation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.214" offset="7388787">This was the so-called captive audience doctrine which in effect penalized the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.544" offset="7410103">Not so much for what he said but for the mere use of his property, as a vehicle for expressing his views concerning union matters to his employees.</text>

            <label>Mr. David E. Feller</label>
            <text syncTime="1898.761" offset="7594945">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.960" offset="7603827">I'd like to address myself preliminarily to some of the questions which my brother has I think quite appropriately remarked should properly be addressed to me rather than to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.427" offset="7649698">That is the question as to whether there was a union request in this case to distribute literature within the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.073" offset="7684284">The record, I may say, does not show any such request.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.197" offset="7704764">The reason it does not show that request, I think, is that no one thought it was relevant to this proceeding from the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.010" offset="7739977">I think anyone with any knowledge in this matter would know that when a union is outside the plant distributing literature, particularly distributing it through non-employees as in the nature of the case, it is almost required to do if it distributes outside the plant, since normally the employees, if there's a one-shift operation have to be inside the plant during working time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.650" offset="7842586">They can't get in and out in time to hand things out at the gates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.342" offset="7861290">As a matter of fact the record in this case does show distribution of literature by the three employees who had been discharged for union activity and by union organizing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.036" offset="7912072">I'm not sure that it shows distribution outside the plant by any employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.804" offset="7939135">As I say, it's not very clear on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.947" offset="7947703">That matter came in with reference to another question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.420" offset="7961600">That is, to whether certain actions which these three employees had taken while they were distributing this literature were a defense against the reinstatement order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.738" offset="7998903">It was never really, there was never in the -- before the trial examiner or before the Board or before the Court of Appeals it was never considered relevant that the union had distributed literature outside the plant or whether employees had.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.995" offset="8055954">Nor was it considered relevant whether the union had asked to distribute literature inside the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.425" offset="8085629">As I said, in this situation, it would not naturally be assumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.570" offset="8102243">It's always better to distribute inside the plant than it is at the gates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.135" offset="8124500">But no issue was joined on that because the simple issue was whether an employer could prohibit such distribution and effectively prohibit such distribution, I -- in the face of a request.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.226" offset="8188865">Well, that was assumed and not -- not tried and at the same time distribute his own literature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.935" offset="8215719">Now, the Board in deciding that case did not base its position on any consideration of equivalent methods of distribution by the union or -- or on consideration as to whether the union had in itself requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.428" offset="8293669">The Board had a simple answer to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.987" offset="8307879">The Board itself, and I think that answer is what is really an issue, and that was what was litigated throughout this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.841" offset="8347272">The Board said, and I am reading from pages 45 to 46 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.779" offset="8379037">Now, the first -- a reply that suggests that the trial examiner had said and the Board's decision quotes his finding that and no objection was made to that finding that the respondent -- and I'm quoting from the trial examiner's report as the Board quoted it, on page 45 of the record that the respondent, “Broke its own rules by campaigning against the union in the normal arena and the most effective one for reaching the employees while simultaneously denying access to it by the union.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.104" offset="8532323">Now, the question as to whether there was actually evidence that the union had requested or not as I said they didn't litigate that question as far as I know in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.916" offset="8567641">But the trial examiner's conclusion was that the union had been effectively denied access to that -- to that form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.353" offset="8601391">And the Board's answer was very simple and it continued saying it disagree with the trial examiner said, “Valid plant rules against solicitation and other forms of union activity do not control an employer's actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.109" offset="8664398">Management prerogative certainly extends far enough, so as to permit an employer to make rules that do not bind himself Otherwise an employer can only enforce a rule he promulgates so long as he conducts himself according to the rule.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.739" offset="8734929">And that was the simple issue which the Board decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.602" offset="8746318">And I think that's the simple issue that it is here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.208" offset="8768784">Now, the Court of Appeals simply said that it disagreed with that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.484" offset="8785920">And that with respect to the plant premises and we're talking about the plant premise, we're not talking about other property, as Your Honors will recall in Stowe Spinning where the question was whether the employer's property rights in other property, a -- a meeting hall to which they denied access to the union was involved which the Court made a distinction between the plant premises and other employer property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.239" offset="8876931">The real basic question is, not with respect to other property or not as -- I think my brother has referred you on whether the union is to be given access to this property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.571" offset="8922279">First of all, it's not the union we're talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.726" offset="8930847">Let me make that very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.522" offset="8938057">It's employees we're talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.061" offset="8952163">The rule with respect to employees and union representative is somewhat different at least since this Court's decision in Babcock &amp; Wilcox case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.376" offset="8989466">We're talking about employees and their rights and we're talking about the plant premises where they work and it's not a question as to whether the employees are to be given access to the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.062" offset="9036173">They have access.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.754" offset="9042965">They're invited there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.619" offset="9046413">They're told that they have a duty to be there to perform their work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.221" offset="9060833">The only question is whether the employer can, with respect to those premises say, “You cannot do thus and so on the union question but I can have my foreman go around and do precisely, thus and so.</text>
