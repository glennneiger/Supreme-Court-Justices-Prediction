            <label>Mr. Michael E. Culligan</label>
            <text syncTime="22.122" offset="88398">Good morning Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.781" offset="95086">Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices of the Court, before presenting argument on behalf of the State of Louisiana, permit me to first express the best wishes of our Attorney General, Jack Gremillion on his request to also thank Your Honors again because of the consideration which Your Honors extended to him on his last argument in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.620" offset="198426">Again, I am very honored and privileged to address Your Honors today on Law Day.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.134" offset="220473">This case is typical exactly of what Mr. Justice Clark said this morning in his telecast.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.011" offset="252029">This is an unfortunate defendant of the colored race without funds here before Your Honors in forma pauperis with both the record and the brief being paid for -- by the United States Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.415" offset="317649">His attorney being appointed by the State of Louisiana, former Assistant District Attorney, a high-minded, high-spirited young man of our city who is now the Assistant City Attorney of the City of New Orleans whose expenses are being paid, travel expenses by the City of New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.581" offset="390269">In order to properly present this case, I think I should inform Your Honors this case concerns only the jury system in the Parish of Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.651" offset="442514">The case is properly stated by Mr. Garon yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.091" offset="468323">It comes before Your Honors on a writ of certiorari from Louisiana Supreme Court, the petitioner having been charged of the crime of murder, being a young college youth, and the victim in the case, being a white woman of the age of the approximately 70.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.880" offset="555468">The alleged motive being burglary and according to his counsel and his brief before for the Louisiana Supreme Court, she was brutally hacked to death by both blunt and sharp instruments and finally killed.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.430" offset="609698">His defense in the lower court simply being that he attempted to burglarize the place but denied any knowledge of the murder itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.516" offset="650031">There are no constitutional questions involved before this Court at this time, except that of an alleged discrimination before the grand juries in the Parish of Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.896" offset="707500">Mr. Justice Whittaker, yesterday morning, asked if there was specific specification of error by Mr. Eubanks' counsel and my desire to inform Justice Whittaker that on page 37 of the record, Mr. Garon in his motion, of course, does refer to a violation of both the Louisiana Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.819" offset="835187">He further particularized in his brief, before the Louisiana Supreme Court in its specification of errors that it was a violation of not -- not only the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution but also a violation of Article 1, Section 2 of the Louisiana Constitution and of the Congressional Act of 1875 making in defense for anyone to deliberately, purposely exclude any person on account of race or color.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.072" offset="960261">The Parish of Orleans which is the only parish in our State that has a different jury selection system consists purely and simply of the City of New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.077" offset="1004251">The territorial limits of the Parish of Orleans and the territorial limits of the City of New Orleans are one and the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.338" offset="1037270">Again, the Parish of Orleans differs entirely from the other parishes of the State.Our District judges in the Parish of Orleans are divided into a civil bench and a criminal bench.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.582" offset="1094322">In other words, in the other parishes, the District judge is the same as the United States District Court judges, handle all types of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.306" offset="1129221">Whereas, in the Parish of Orleans, the Criminal District Court is strictly a court exclusively of criminal jurisdiction, whereas, the civil court is civil and probate jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.555" offset="1174152">Again, on a selection of the very jury commission itself and the parishes other than Orleans, the jury commission is appointed and selected by the District judge, the clerk of court being the ex officio Chairman of the Commission which is somewhat similar, if not entirely similar as to the juries as far as the United States Courts are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.896" offset="1287523">In the Parish of Orleans, the jury commission is not selected by the District judge.The jury commission is appointed for a term of four years by the Governor or during or at the pleasure of Governor.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.928" offset="1347709">In the parishes, the jury commission says at the pleasure of the District judge who has appointed him.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.311" offset="1385221">Again, to draw distinctions and I'm doing this, sir, because, the cases become -- that have come before Your Honors have never arisen out of the Parish of Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.702" offset="1430779">There is no case ever in this Court from the Parish of Orleans on this particular subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.940" offset="1459722">The number of names that go into the -- what we call the jury wheel or the general venire is different, 300 in the country parishes minimum, 750 minimum in the City of New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.905" offset="1519595">The selection of the grand jury again is different in the country parishes than it is in the City of New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.187" offset="1544673">In the country parishes out of the 300 names that are in the general venire, 20 names are selected by the jury commission and placed in an envelope.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.111" offset="1580408">It is sealed and then from that envelope -- I've gone a little ahead of myself The names of those 20 are placed on a list.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.489" offset="1617920">The District judge and the parishes other than Orleans, selects one of those 20 names and appoint him as foreman of the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.386" offset="1657522">Out of the 19 remaining names, then 11 are drawn by a lot of chance and that constitutes the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.835" offset="1695242">In the Parish of Orleans, out of the 750 names, the jury commission takes and draws 700 -- put 750 names minimum in this jury wheel.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.309" offset="1761176">Mechanically, it is a large very ornate brass drum that is about the size of a oil barrel drum that has a manually operated control handle in which the names are placed.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.469" offset="1825855">The sheriff, the clerk of court and anybody else can be present at the time of the drawing.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.002" offset="1843931">The wheel is simply turning around, the drum is rotated.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.493" offset="1857933">The names are drawn out and then the names are placed on a list.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.132" offset="1880503">That list does not show whether there are Black, White or Indian and we have Indians in New Orleans as well as Negroes, Chinese and whatnots.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.577" offset="1934211">Now, the 75 names that are drawn or placed upon a list, again that list has no indication in any manner, shape or form of the color, of the particular perspective jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.357" offset="2013414">The list goes to the District judge and I will, later on, in the course of this discourse show how each one of the judges does with that list after he receives it.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.638" offset="2094498">We have in Orleans Parish at this time, eight sections of our criminal court and eight sections of our civil court.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.098" offset="2128353">The jury is picked by rotation which makes today, a judge select a grand jury once every four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.613" offset="2162416">At the time of this particular case there were only six judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.117" offset="2180389">So, a grand jury was selected once by each judge every three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.543" offset="2206093">Now, departing for a minute from the background history, I would like first to explain to Your Honors the similarity of our laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.403" offset="2253531">In other words, the United States Constitutional -- Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution which is the Equal Protection Clause and under which this case is -- comes up was ratified in the State of the Louisiana in 1868.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.481" offset="2325838">In 1879, our Constitution which is Article 1, Section 2 repeats practically verbatim, the Fourteenth Amendment is part of the Louisiana Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.245" offset="2380904">Again, on the question of -- there being no distinction as to race or color.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.232" offset="2412878">We antedated the Congress of the United States on statutory law.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.829" offset="2435239">I have quoted the exact statute in our brief.Our first statute was passed in the year 1868.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.587" offset="2466273">The federal statute was not passed until the year 1875.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.611" offset="2486439">I'm saying that to Your Honors for this reason that in the number of these cases this Court has commented on the fact that certain States have by innovations tried to let us say evade the jurisprudence of this Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.558" offset="2546207">Our State has not done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.885" offset="2551536">We've not only agree with the United States, we have been anticipated the United States on this particular Negro question in criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.388" offset="2589466">Our Louisiana Supreme Court has followed every decision that Your Honors have ever written.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.863" offset="2619350">We are very proud of the fact that we have never had a criminal case since 1938, remanded to our Louisiana Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.702" offset="2666789">1938 was the famous Pierre case written by Mr. Justice Black, if I remember correctly sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.058" offset="2696150">And in 1939, immediately after that decision that was not from the Parish of Orleans, it was going to Parish of St. Charles where an entirely different system of jury selection was in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.123" offset="2748395">The jury system was immediately changed in that Parish.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.395" offset="2761561">Pierre was retried and sentenced to death and hanged after again an appeal taken to this Court and Your Honors approved our change in jury system.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.944" offset="2799700">So, we have followed and kept abreast of every case that has been spoken of in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.848" offset="2839301">One New Orleans yesterday has the part of Cassell case.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.551" offset="2854139">I forgot which one New Orleans made that comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.105" offset="2868349">Cassell case was courted by the State in its brief in this particular case, the Eubanks case.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.583" offset="2910250">The Cassell case was also used in the foundation by Louisiana Supreme Court and I think the case of State versus Allan.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.218" offset="2948807">I will be sure about the name later in which, to one of our District Attorneys immediately upon the handing down of the Cassell case said that they were on the wrong track as far as the interpretation of the decision of this Honorable Court and immediately had a grand jury thrown out and a new grand jury empowered.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.843" offset="3031353">That again was from Allan Parish or one of the north Louisiana Parishes.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.185" offset="3056640">The legal situation here has been covered.</text>

            <text syncTime="794.057" offset="3176176">Any other cases are just by, as the rule, direct votes of information in the City of New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.137" offset="3200522">In the parishes other than the City of New Orleans, the grand jury is used in practically every case, but in Orleans Parish due to the volume of business, that is practically used today for capital cases and for investigations of great public interest such as vote frauds, graft in police departments, mismanagement of public funds where it is in strictly an inquisitorial body, not just a case between the State and a particular defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.415" offset="3337613">That is one reason why and I will get to that in a few minutes, why that distinction in the Parish of Orleans is against the other parishes.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.734" offset="3370841">In other words, our city is the largest city we believe in the south and (Inaudible) for its Chamber of Commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.091" offset="3396336">But we sincerely believe that we have the largest cosmopolitan seaport in the southern territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.774" offset="3419011">We have been abreast not only to the decisions of this Court but abreast of the times as far as law is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.199" offset="3448790">The decision to this that I might also say this inasmuch as Your Honor asked about that grand jury proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.614" offset="3486407">Both grand juries and petit juries in the Parish of Orleans received absolutely no pay, no mileage, no conversation of any character description.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.017" offset="3531964">Therefore, there is a tendency, it might say psychologically speaking of escape by particularly our colored citizens because it would be very onerous to them to serve on either petit juries or particularly on grand juries without any type of compensation and I say particularly on grand juries because the grand juries are in employment for six months, 20 times to meet four and five times in one week, whereas the petit juries as rule is usually a maximum of about 12 days service in one month.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.061" offset="3708238">Out of maybe a 150 names on a petit jury panel, the average man may only serve one case and then he's discharged for the statutory part to be recalled after six -- six months or a year.</text>

            <text syncTime="968.232" offset="3872914">I intended reviewing the jurisprudence of this Court, the Louisiana Supreme Court, the effect of the jurisprudence as opposed to these courts has simply been this.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.550" offset="3910113">Over 30 years since 1879 since the Virginia versus Rives case and Strauder versus West Virgina.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.655" offset="3938534">The jurisprudence has been built up is as it were over 30 years it has been a continuous lack of the Negro either on a petit jury or a grand jury that that is a strong presumption that the exclusion has been quite slow, systematic and solely on account of race and color.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.621" offset="4026410">The jurisprudence has also we think that that is rebuttable and that is why I stated to Mr. Justice Frankfurter just now, I will review the jurisprudence placed and then from the facts that I just gave you which will be from either the Whites of the jury commissioners, that's in the record and Whites of the former District Attorneys since my day back in 1928 up to present day, everyday District Attorney was called in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.317" offset="4137169">Every District judge it was alive was called and not only now, but way back in 1941, this same case was before the Louisiana Supreme Court the same factual situation in which these same judges testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.001" offset="4195997">However, that case has never come up before Your Honors because it was replaced on a different point entirely of Louisiana law and not on the Constitutional Law of point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.636" offset="4234449">The case of Akins versus Texas, the majority opinion there was by Mr. Justice Reed all of these cases, sir, without going into detail or naturally capital cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.159" offset="4292545">That was the Texas system at that time.This case was in 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.223" offset="4316891">And I'll give a more elaborate description when I hit the Cassell case, where the jury commission in the State of Texas in interpreting Your Honors' previous decisions in I think Pierre versus Texas and possibly the Smith versus Texas, one of the impression that they put one man on this jury panel, the grand jury panel, that that would be enough to satisfy the rulings of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.050" offset="4432144">In other words, the jury system in Texas which the plan has been approved by this Court in Cassell versus Texas in which is a self -- I'll give a more full explanation of later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.968" offset="4487837">16 men were selected by the jury commission out of which 12 were then taken by the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.549" offset="4522109">In that case, this Court said that one token representation was just as bad as none at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.638" offset="4554501">Carter versus Texas was way back in 1900.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.536" offset="4570070">In that case, under the then existing Texas Law, you had to challenge the grand jury before they took office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.403" offset="4629525">Carter committed a crime after the grand jury took office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.990" offset="4643944">Therefore, Carter had no opportunity of challenging the grand jury at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.910" offset="4663589">The Court nicely replaced that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.377" offset="4673411">Cassell versus Texas I'll place on the side at this minute for the reason that Cassell versus Texas as opposed to its approach to any jurisprudence either in the Louisiana Supreme Court or in Your Honor's Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.339" offset="4741329">Although, there is no point, no case exactly in point in either court because nothing of this kind has ever come before this Court or before the Louisiana Supreme Court except in State versus Dorsey which never got before Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.601" offset="4798380">In Gibson versus Mississippi, that was a denial way back in 1896 by then Justice Harlan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.957" offset="4831817">I know that's not New Orleans but it was that Justice Harlan at that time, he wrote the majority opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.022" offset="4856059">The removal was denied on the basis that the State of Mississippi were not disqualifying the Negroes from the jury and the Court never did actually decide the question of the exclusion from the panel list and was never properly raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.121" offset="4924395">In the case of Hernandez versus Texas, that again was an exclusion of Mexicans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.467" offset="4957832">In that case, the Court found a systematic exclusion of the Mexicans because at no time, Mexicans had ever been put on a jury list of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.821" offset="4999210">The Court said that just from the time alone that they could tell from the name that that was a Mexican descent and the jury commissions themselves might have been unconscious of what they were doing, but they did it straight on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.807" offset="5051141">Hill versus Texas was in 1942 after the Texas law had been changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.774" offset="5079040">The -- again, there was never a Negro on the grand jury list.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.436" offset="5113731">The jury commission, however had to pick the petit jury and actually the general venire out of which the grand jury his place has been selected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.204" offset="5156780">The jury commission testified that they did not even know a single qualified Negro in the whole city of Dallas, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.390" offset="5185515">The Court did not take that with a grain of salt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.458" offset="5193770">That means that they replaced the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.114" offset="5204428">Martin versus Texas, the defendant in that case did not get any jurisprudence out of this Court from sufficient reason that all they did was file an affidavit and offered no evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.142" offset="5276526">Neal versus Delaware which was the case back in 1880.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.944" offset="5315709">The Court -- the state court refused to allow the introduction of any evidence to prove exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.572" offset="5354266">In 1935, Norris versus Alabama, that's one of the celebrated Scottsboro cases written by Chief Justice Hughes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.680" offset="5398674">There've never been any Negroes and there was a total exclusion, no attempt made, to ever put anybody, any Negroes or any type of jury, grand or petit.Patton versus Mississippi in 1947, the attack there was made on account of exclusion over a period of 30 years on the petit juries and the State made no defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.314" offset="5497208">It failed to make out any -- give any evidence of exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.271" offset="5517061">Pierre versus Louisiana was in 1938 in which as I stated before, Justice Black wrote that opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.137" offset="5564500">That's from the Parish of St. Charles which has this different system of jury selection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.847" offset="5595324">In that particular case, the District judge held that there was discrimination but along the lines of an opinion that had been written by Mr. Justice Jackson and then as much as the attack was levelled against the grand jury that it did not affect guilt or innocence and therefore could not be prejudicial so he refused to sustain the motion to quash.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.498" offset="5725936">The Louisiana Supreme Court said he was wrong on the second premise, he was right on the second premise but he was wrong on the first premise that there was no exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.181" offset="5780689">Our Chief Justice, our late, commended and beloved Charles O'Neil decided with the majority opinion of the court and said the District judge was absolutely correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.794" offset="5819141">Justice Black agreed or I should say can claim the dissenting opinion of our Chief Justice in which Justice Black pointed out that Chief Justice O'Neil was correct for reason of the fact that the District judge was a competent lawyer before he went on the bench.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.767" offset="5891030">He had been a District Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.568" offset="5898240">He had been a judge from a number of years, and he certainly knew local conditions somewhat better than the other gentleman who had won our Louisiana Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.833" offset="5939304">The second Pierre case was affirmed by this Court because as I say the jury system was changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.946" offset="5967726">Reece versus Georgia was written I think by Justice Clark.Reece versus Georgia, we say with honorable pride is practically a restatement of our Louisiana Supreme Court in State versus Nichols.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.581" offset="6050273">The same identical principle of the law is laid down 10 years before by the Louisiana Supreme Court in State versus Nichols on the basis that the -- the case actually did not turn in on the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.806" offset="6131148">It was in our case of Sate versus Nichols.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.101" offset="6144313">In other words, in our case it was token representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.124" offset="6156434">The case was not decided here on that point but the logic of the case is exactly the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.820" offset="6187259">Rogers versus Alabama, again, it was remanded because the District Court refused to permit any evidence to be introduced of the exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.978" offset="6247863">Smith versus Texas in that case in 1940 the opinion was written by Justice Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.684" offset="6278687">The commissioners in that case -- the jury commissioners said that they just choose to place the persons on the grand jury list from among their personal appointees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.931" offset="6315677">That they wanted to claim if there were any Negroes, therefore, they didn't worry upon it so they just didn't put any on the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.639" offset="6346501">The case was properly reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.549" offset="6358100">Strauder versus West Virginia was in 1879 in which the statutes of West Virginia absolutely excluded the Negro because they said that the men to serve on juries jury had to be White males.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.801" offset="6427167">A number of the States later amended similar statutes, cut out the word “white” and the word “males” after the emancipation of women and also putting “females.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.141" offset="6464470">Now, as far as the very first case on the subject in this Court was Virginia versus Reece in 1879, 100 U.S. in which the Court stated that while the facts might have been stated that no Negroes were on the grand jury or on a petit jury have ever been put on there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.583" offset="6546286">And how did it -- the jury which indicted them and have found that summons to trial had been impartially selected that the test was not a mixed jury in any particular case that that was not a sanction to the Equal Protection Clause of the Federal Constitution and a right is not given for any law of Virginia or by any federal statute to have a mixed jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.935" offset="6639700">Complaint in this case while theoretically might be said not to be exactly this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.815" offset="6679197">I say it's nothing more or less and exactly the same complaint that was made in Virginia versus Reece back in 1879.The complaint is that there was no Negroes on this panel although they could've been.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.051" offset="6740114">The case State versus Green, I mention State versus Green here, this is a Louisiana case which is written by Mr. Justice McCaleb.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.390" offset="6789538">That was the case where the District Attorney called the grand jury and he says “Gentlemen since the Cassell case, we've been doing things all wrong in this parish.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.714" offset="6822766">So the judge discharged the grand jury and immediately went to work and had new men the will open -- new men put in so that there would be representation by Negro race.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.413" offset="6881593">In that case, the -- there was a claim inclusion made but not passed upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.357" offset="6917329">Now, I mentioned already the words of Justice Black -- Mr. Justice Black in the Pierre case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.048" offset="6972186">Also, as I mentioned the case of State versus Nichols, a Louisiana case, Mr. Justice Morris out of Avoyelles Parish, where out of the panel of 300, only there was -- there was only three Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.322" offset="7041254">The clerk of Court was the ex officio jury commissioner in that case testified that in his opinion no Negroes ought to serve on jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.648" offset="7070511">So Justice Morris very promptly reversed the case, sent it back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.710" offset="7090782">And in that case again, showing you the consciousness of our Supreme Court of the impact of Your Honors on our jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.725" offset="7126831">Justice Morris in that case placed, I might say somewhat poetic words said the United States Supreme Court is a planet into whose orbit, the vortex of all the judicial opinions of the entire United States must ultimately pass in order to give the law it stated.</text>

            <text syncTime="2520.813" offset="10083161">He went to the then District Attorney, Eugene Stanley who was also a teacher of law and a writer of law books.</text>

            <text syncTime="2606.067" offset="10424216">That the excuse is given where the jury commission excused and applied equally as well on the count of the economic situations to the whites as to the colored.</text>
