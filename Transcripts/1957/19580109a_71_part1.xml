            <text syncTime="22.736" offset="90906">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.574" offset="114207">This case that we have today is a bit different from the points that normally get publicity, the ones of the Federal Government imposing their will upon the state's rights of the various states.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.427" offset="177633">I think in this instance, this is a case of the State imposing its will on the federal rights in a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.249" offset="208980">We have involved in this case -- I would like to relate the facts if that's permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.890" offset="251507">A man charged with possession of liquor in the State of Texas on which the Texas liquor stamp had not been paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.540" offset="302080">The facts involved -- he was fined incidentally $100 in the County Court of Hidalgo County, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.130" offset="336457">The facts involved are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.494" offset="345966">Mr. Gordon, the appellant, his wife and daughter had been residing for sometime in Cuernavaca, Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.802" offset="379193">Mr. Gordon is or was an author.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.966" offset="403853">His wife and his daughter decided that they should return to the States and in the process, they purchased each of them and jointly together, 12 bottles of Mexican liquor.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.733" offset="466860">I think there were some eight or nine bottles of rums and some other types of brandy, a total of 12 bottles.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.787" offset="491102">They reached the border and during the period of their journey with 11 bottles as they cross the port of entry in Hidalgo -- Hidalgo County, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.264" offset="533002">They passed through the U.S. customs inspection and after clearance through the customs inspection station, they were approached by the Texas State Control Board official on duty at the International Bridge there in Hidalgo and requested that they pay a Texas state liquor tax on this liquor which they were importing from the State of Mexico -- Republic of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.397" offset="641567">They were merely joining -- he requested that that be paid and the appellant refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.646" offset="678557">His offhand remark as I recall the testimony was that it was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.906" offset="703530">He left the port of entry in journeyed towards McAllen, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.777" offset="723069">Town of ten miles away, he was stopped in the process by state highway patrolmen, some seven miles distance and held by them -- by the state highway patrolmen until some officials for the Liquor Control Board arrived at the point where he was stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.782" offset="791092">He was taken into custody by the officials of the Liquor Control Board and turned to the International Bridge and given the opportunity to again pay the Texas state tax and he again he refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.051" offset="856189">The officials then took Mr. Gordon before a local Justice of the Peace and charged him with the possession of unstamped liquor in the State of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.101" offset="900389">He was held in jail that night and the next day he was released and he and his wife and daughter continued their journey to the State of North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.857" offset="943334">He returned in November and was tried the jury -- before a jury and the jury verdict was guilty and a fine of $100 was given.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.018" offset="1000072">I might mention that the car that he was driving bore a North Carolina license plate at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.208" offset="1024731">Now, at the time of trial prior thereto in -- at all times during the appeal, we raised two points that the Texas liquor tax violated the U.S. Constitution that it violated it -- the portion of the Export-Import Clause where Congress is given the control over duties on exports and imports and secondly on the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.536" offset="1162136">We presented this to the Court for the first time in a motion to dismiss prior to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.038" offset="1188049">We also had a sworn motion to quash prior to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.097" offset="1212291">We had our trial -- both of those motions were overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.581" offset="1230263">We had a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.559" offset="1234233">I had a motion to instruct a verdict in favor of the jury based on these two grounds and some others that were local in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.809" offset="1279164">That motion was overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.592" offset="1286269">The verdict was brought in.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.105" offset="1292330">I mean prior to that time, a requested instructions of the Court to the jury, upholding and showing these various courses of the constitutionality that -- so that they could be presented and argued to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.639" offset="1354501">These instructions were used by the Court and then the verdict was held.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.338" offset="1385326">We presented our exceptions, our bills of exceptions on all of those points at the Court of Criminal Appeals in the State of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.001" offset="1415941">And in their opinion, the constitutionality question did not arise or it was not pertinent to this very fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.360" offset="1461394">I would first like --</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="365.757" offset="1462962">It passed on -- it passed on the constitutional question.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="b_r_stewart" startTime="367.968" stopTime="671.977">
            <label>Mr. B. R. Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="368.673" offset="1474664">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.984" offset="1475918">They said that -- that -- so far as they can see that it was not violative of the Constitution in both instances either on the Commerce Clause or under the Export-Import Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.287" offset="1537045">The export-import portion is based on the clause which gives to Congress the complete control of duties on exports and imports.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.039" offset="1616144">There's one exception in there for inspection purposes and I don't think that enters -- enter this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.377" offset="1637460">I don't think it entered into the record, any place.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.979" offset="1659820">The first case that came before this Court as I read the cases, was the case of Brown versus Maryland in 1837 I believe, Chief Justice Marshall wrote the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.710" offset="1714782">And in that case, he set up what is known as the original package doctrine saying that when a thing is imported from a foreign country or without the boundaries of the United States, then such import is not subject to state taxation as long as it remains in the hands of the importer that the same is in the original package and under the control of the import.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.332" offset="1837244">When such import become so commingled with the mass of the goods of a state to which it is destined, then in that instance, the state might have control and may have the right to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.784" offset="1895131">Now, this case was considered next -- I mean the provision of the Constitution was next considered by the Court in the license cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.300" offset="1941107">There were three cases from New Hampshire and Massachusetts in Rhode Island, involving the question of a local ordinance requiring a tax on sellers of liquor in the local towns and they were brought up.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.205" offset="2004741">None of which were involved on a direct import from the -- from a foreign country.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.163" offset="2028565">They had gone through the process of being sold or were out of the importers but Chief Justice Taney and several of the other justices stated that if the liquor involved in the cases had been a foreign import that the -- the town ordinances would have been unconstitutional that the tax would not have been valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.352" offset="2137339">The -- there are a number of other cases along that line.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.983" offset="2155833">The -- probably a pertinent one is -- there was -- was the case of Low versus Austin in which liquor imported from France was taken into the City of San Francisco and stored in the warehouse there.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.873" offset="2227409">The City of San Francisco attempted to assess an ad valorem tax on the liquor as it was stored in the warehouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.220" offset="2260846">It was still in the hands of the original importer.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.385" offset="2277460">And they import or paid the tax and then sue to recover it on the grounds that it was an unconstitutional tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.342" offset="2313300">The Court -- this Court held that such a tax, even though it was equal to all goods in the City of San Francisco, not discriminating as to the liquor or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.323" offset="2381218">The Court held that the tax was invalid because the import was still in -- in the hands of the importer.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.665" offset="2410580">And consequently, it was not subject to a local taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.564" offset="2426253">It had not become a part of the general mass of goods of the -- the state or the tax immunity was trying to levy the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.637" offset="2462511">Perhaps, the most recent case considered by this Court was Hooven &amp; Allison Co. versus Evatt involving a case of him.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.389" offset="2501486">Now these ones that I've cited before had been involving liquor.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.869" offset="2523429">Hooven &amp; Allison Co. versus Evatt involved a rope manufacturer in the State of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.881" offset="2551432">And he had imported him from India, from the Philippine Islands and various other places and stored it in his warehouse in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.787" offset="2591138">The State of Ohio attempted to assess the ad valorem tax on that import.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.596" offset="2626351">This Court held in that case that it was still in the hands of the importer and was not subject to a state tax, even though it had come to rest in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.757" offset="2663027">It had not become a part of the mass of goods in the State of Ohio and consequently it was not subject to a tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="1309.356" offset="5237342">But the case of Simpson versus U.S., I think sets that at rest, involved a man transporting five bottles of liquor across the -- a state line into a state where the manufacture of liquor was prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.347" offset="5309336">And he was filed on under a federal statute for transporting.</text>

            <text syncTime="1370.568" offset="5482266">There were a number of cases that bothers me by virtue of the fact that this Court had passed on liquor question a number of times in connection with the Twenty-first Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.151" offset="5540571">And I think that in all of those cases, the Court has held that the state has a right to enact regulatory measures concerning the interstate transportation of liquor.</text>

            <text syncTime="1442.166" offset="5768568">The -- perhaps the most recent case was the case of Carter versus the Commonwealth or Carter versus Virginia before this Court in 1944.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.969" offset="5823843">That the Court said at that time, it has been held that a shipment through a state is not transportation or importation into a state within the meaning of the amendment, talking about the Twenty-first Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.130" offset="5884447">It is enough that Virginia could conclude in the absence of contrary federal legislation that she could not safely permit the transportation of liquor through her territory by those who concededly mean to break federal laws and the rules of a neighboring state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.947" offset="5955709">Now, I say that by the action of the Congress in allowing a person to bring this import in, free of duty, is such federal legislation or federal action as the Court had in mind and that consequently, being in interstate commerce that the state action of trying to impose a tax on goods moving through the state must be void regardless of the fact that they were uniform as to all liquor in the State of Texas.</text>
