            <text syncTime="1130.416" offset="4521587">As counsel stated this case is before the Court on a writ -- on a motion to dismiss and the correctness of the ruling is to be determined by the pleading rather than by statement which may had been made which go beyond the pleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.287" offset="4609045">We do not think that this gentleman filed a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.115" offset="4632451">He did not allege that there was a test or a question of his fitness and ability raised and upon that issue the company decided that he was fit and able and therefore gave him this job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.721" offset="4694831">The pleading does not recite why or under what circumstances that was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.603" offset="4726387">In our brief, a statement is made that he was given this assistant cashier job on -- as of October 7, 1952 through a mistake of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.247" offset="4776960">And that therefore we have the right to correct it when the circumstances arise such as force reduction and the matter was brought to our attention again and we do correct it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.158" offset="4820532">If it were -- has a mistake of law, it could have arisen as counsel said, I don't know whether it's true or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.017" offset="4851984">But he said that the man was permitted to bump the man off of the assistant cashier's job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.353" offset="4889391">Well, if that's what happened, it would be a mistake of law because he could only bump the man if he had seniority in group one which he didn't have at the time the bump had took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.691" offset="4946756">So if he bumped the man it was a mistake of law and contrary to the contract itself which requires that bumping can be done only in the exercise of seniority in the group in which the position is located.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.811" offset="5019167">We'd like to state that this man has now the exact position which he had when he entered military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.859" offset="5055425">He has now the exact date in that position which he had when he was in military service.He has not been deprived of any seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.869" offset="5103386">And as in the question as to whether the statute gave him any greater right than the contract it itself, the statute itself, Section 9 (c) (1) and the preceding Section does not undertake to give a man in so many words a promotion right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.837" offset="5207249">Neither does 9 (c) (2) using as such or as to this language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.873" offset="5231491">Now, the statute therefore on its face does not give it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.739" offset="5254896">And we do no think the legislative history of the Act show us that he was entitled to it either because Senate Bill 2655 was introduced in the 1940 -- in 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.918" offset="5315605">House Bill 6401 was introduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.840" offset="5331278">The Senate Bill was substantially the same in respect to this face of the law as the 1940 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.315" offset="5357192">The House Bill went on the say that he would be entitled to promotional rights, the promotions to which he might have had if you had remained in the service and had not joined the army.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.615" offset="5422393">When the Senate Bill was passed and went to the House, the House amended the Senate Bill, was striking out everything except the enacting clause and setting out the House Bill as an amendment of the Senate Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.946" offset="5479758">And it went to conference and as a result of that conference the -- they came out with a bill reinstating in effect the Senate provisions in eliminating the House provision about the man being entitled to such promotions as he might have had had he remained in the company's employ.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.337" offset="5569306">Now therefore, under the statute by its expressed language and not of the legislative history, he is not entitled to what he seeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.361" offset="5613401">If he is entitled to what he seeks he must get it by virtue of the collective agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.345" offset="5641300">Answering Mr. Justice Frankfurter, of course the statute does not give him any greater rights than he had at the time he entered the service as spelled out in the agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="2067.447" offset="8269740">We think in addition that crystalizing what this contract is all about and what it means, that there is absolutely no basis under the terms of this contract where the petitioners claim, there is nothing to send back to a trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.289" offset="8341107">We feel that it's crystal clear that under Rule 1 (3) (a) which is the one involved here, the references to the moving from class two to class one are solely and exclusively precatory and nothing more and nothing else, and therefore that no right of any nature, description exist on the part of this petitioner, nor is there any probability one way or the other that's legally recognizable.</text>

            <text syncTime="2650.661" offset="10602580">Number one, the -- it's perfectly clear that in the Diehl case, a man was a car man helper before he went into the service, he became a temporary car men mechanic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.791" offset="10659109">While he was on the service it was decided between the railroad and the union that after the war emergency was over, then at that juncture, the parties would determine what the status of temporary car men mechanics would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.907" offset="10719608">The man came back from the war.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.923" offset="10727654">He was again made a temporary car man mechanic and in June of 1956, had he not gone in the service he would have served 1160 hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.200" offset="10772793">Actually, sometime in very early 1949, it was 1160 days, actually in early 1949, he did complete 1160 actual days.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.851" offset="10823367">And about two months later, the union and the company arrived in an agreement that a man who had 1160 days of experience was a temporary car man mechanic would then be placed upon the permanent roster, a -- an absolute right conferred by that contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.198" offset="10904764">The only thing that I can view out of what this Court did was to say that in determining the 1160 days of the experience that the time that he spend in service had to be counted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.137" offset="10964532">I think the result is totally consistent with the Fishgold case and I do not believe that it takes us up into the celestial atmosphere of creating of a new theory of reasonable probability.</text>

            <text syncTime="2817.754" offset="11271001">I can only tell you that I was instructed by the business agent or the group to go down to Muskogee and keep the Court from getting a new tangled crazy interpretation of this agreement that hadn't been adopted in 1925.[Laughs]</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.849" offset="11327321">That was situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.496" offset="11333904">But I -- I'm not able to answer of my own personal knowledge about those records.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.416" offset="11353652">If I may, I should like to depart from that subject matter and bring to the intention of the Court several matters which we feel would compel that the result below be sustained regardless of the principal issue raised by Mr. Clinton and with the Railroad, we fairly concur.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.074" offset="11428258">We feel that over and above that issue, the District Court below like jurisdiction over this cause at all, because we feel that the subject matter of the petitioner's claim, lies solely and exclusively within the jurisdiction of the National Railroad Adjustment Board under the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.106" offset="11520418">That point was disregarded by the trial judge and was rejected by the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.903" offset="11547585">We believe that it's mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.348" offset="11553332">Now, we point out first that if this case were to go to trial, the trial judge would have to take the agreement between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.653" offset="11602547">He would have to construe it and he would have to interpret it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.713" offset="11618847">He would have to determine what Rule 1 meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.284" offset="11633058">He would have to read it in light of the other rules of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.114" offset="11648418">He would have to determine the seniority rights of this man if he had any or he would have to determine the impact upon those rights of other provisions of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.912" offset="11691572">Now, we respectfully submit that that function is vested solely and exclusively in the National Railroad Adjustment Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.641" offset="11726472">In the case of Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen against Chicago Railroad and Indiana Railroad Company, Mr. Chief Justice Warren traced in some detail, the history of the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.700" offset="11782792">It was there pointed out and it's true that that Act represents the culmination of some six years -- 60 years of thoughtful effort on the part of the railroads and the unions to find some means to bring about stable and harmonious labor relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.076" offset="11844232">Because of course the matter of uninterrupted railroad service is one of prime importance and significance to the American people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.768" offset="11879027">The Act as it presently exist as a result of that effort and there's the opinion referred to a moment ago pointed out, it was not until 1934, when the old 26 Act was amended, that a machinery was established with sufficiently and enforceability to consummate the desire of the parties for harmonious relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.382" offset="11985502">That machinery in part was the National Railroad Adjustment Board, charged with the duty of determining disputes between the carriers and the Unions with respect to interpretation and construction of the contract entered into an extent between the carriers and the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.264" offset="12081006">There has been a considerable amount of litigation over the years concerning the nature of the jurisdiction of that National Railroad Adjustment Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.792" offset="12119144">And I believe that this Court and really all courts have unqualifiedly held giving proper weight to the language of the statute to the degree of expertise possessed by the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.709" offset="12174733">That the jurisdiction of that Board to determine matters of interpretation and construction in Railway Labor Contracts is exclusive, said that in the Slocum against Delaware, Lackawanna and so forth case where you said we hold unqualifiedly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.280" offset="12237113">We hold that the jurisdiction of the Board to adjust grievances and disputes of the type here involved is exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.699" offset="12262713">And there are a plethora of other cases decided by this Court and by the Courts Of Appeals so holding.</text>

            <text syncTime="3228.155" offset="12912536">Quite patently, here you have a Railway Labor Act which sets up a procedure which was spelled out over many years of trial and error, predicated upon the need for finding harmony and stability in labor relations and an industry that had been marked by a lack of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.972" offset="12987873">And then finally these means was found and created.</text>

            <text syncTime="3253.478" offset="13013891">Because there are special unique problems in the railway industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.286" offset="13033117">It was felt that in order to resolve them, you needed a specially constituted board and this Court and other courts have commented upon that subject over and over.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.619" offset="13078465">Now, we feel that viewing all of the factors, the intelligent sound thing to do with these two Acts to put them together and this Court has never ruled upon this issue and no other Court in my opinion has seriously consider it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.806" offset="13147220">The only way to put those two together as I see it is to keep in mind now that Universal Military Training Act applies to all service men.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.541" offset="13182119">It's -- it covers the entire industrial area of activity whereas the Railway Labor Act feels with unique and specific special problems.Therefore we feel that if you have a Railway Labor Act matter where a contract interpretation and construction matter should under the Railway Labor Act go to the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.573" offset="13274279">Then we feel, that the impact of the Universal Military Training and Service Act, in order to be intelligently coordinated with the other Act, should simply be deferred until the processes of the Railway Labor Act has been exhausted.</text>

            <text syncTime="3445.469" offset="13781786">Well then, Mr. Fabian has a perfect right to go up to the National Railroad Adjustment Board, under this agreement or maybe the Brotherhood on his behalf or someone in the National Railroad Adjustment Board and decides the same issue in reverse that the District Court down there at was Muskogee decided, and maybe the National Railroad Adjustment Board might feel that -- that the District Court at Muskogee was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.190" offset="13876663">That Fabian deserves the job not McKinney and so they might entered that award and of course Fabian has a right to go into the District Court with a suit for statutory enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.438" offset="13917727">And he is entitled to a prima facie weight to that decision and maybe he'd win that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.549" offset="13938103">Then you'd have the railroad confronted with the unique situation of having the District Court in one place telling that Mr. Fabian should have job X and the District Court in another place telling that Mr. McKinney should have job X.</text>
