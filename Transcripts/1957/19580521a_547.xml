            <text syncTime="15.608" offset="62380">Chief Justice Warren, Honorable Justices of this Court, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.882" offset="119432">This seemed to the petitioner to be a case where in the factual situation is infinitely more important than the legal situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.754" offset="166975">In other words, the petitioner does not propose to spend a great deal of time on the legal questions involved here unless something new is raised by the respondent concerning the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.869" offset="243461">I think it's conceded by both sides that this Court has the right in certiorari to review de novo the entire proceedings in a state court in a criminal case and to determine and make an independent determination as to whether the Fourteenth Amendment has been violated in due process of law, denied to the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.537" offset="366132">The -- without going to an extended argument now about the law, the recent decisions and the past decisions going back many years indicate that there should be no question about this proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.362" offset="437394">And now, to the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.248" offset="460904">On August 31st, 1954, a little boy by the name of Jimmy Bremmers disappeared from his home, Sioux City, Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.447" offset="521718">And about 29 days later, his body was found after extended search in a pasture about 6 miles from Sioux City out on a winding country road.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.660" offset="586606">It happened at this time that Mr. Ernest Triplett who is the petitioner in this case was soliciting music lessons from parents in the vicinity where Jimmy Bremmers lived on the night he disappeared and on other occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.064" offset="676153">Now, a neighbor out in that vicinity called the Police Department in Sioux City and said there was a music salesman out here soliciting music lessons the night Jimmy disappeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.529" offset="726100">And on that suspicion alone, Ernest Triplett was requested or his employer was requested to have Mr. Triplett wait for the police because they want to question him.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.901" offset="779598">Now, this request for Mr. Triplett to wait at his employer's office, the Flood Music Company in Sioux City for the police came in about 9:30.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.168" offset="832575">Mr. Flood testified as he didn't appear nervous at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.571" offset="842188">He said, “Yes, I'll wait for them.”</text>
            <text syncTime="212.058" offset="848144">He waited for them until 1:30 in the afternoon, went out and got his lunch and came back.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.521" offset="878028">And then about 1:30 in the afternoon, they came to get him.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.685" offset="890671">And Detective Dennison and Matousec, Sioux City Police, took him into custody where as the record shows here, he was detained without a warrant for a total of 20 or 21 days by the police and that interval of detention was interrupted twice by sending him down to the state hospital for mental treatment at Cherokee, Iowa near Sioux City.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.714" offset="1038838">Now, the first instance he was sent down there by the request, he says detective -- one of the detectives in Sioux City and that was on September 15th, 1954.</text>

            <text syncTime="1222.227" offset="4888869">Chief Justice, Associate Justices, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.586" offset="4930247">This Court has recently interested itself in a number of cases similar to the one now before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.959" offset="4959817">The gist of these cases, that is those cases which pertain to state criminal prosecutions, has been to determine -- for this Court to determine whether or not and a confession obtained in the period of custody was obtained in such a manner as to violate the -- the petitioners or the defendants rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, that is whether or not the -- the confession was obtained by physical or mental coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.985" offset="5127837">The test as recently reaffirmed in the Payne case on Monday remains.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.374" offset="5161482">It's the contrasting of the pressures that are applied to the person confessing as opposed to his power to resist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.098" offset="5208294">That question as pointed out by the respondents certainly can -- or by the petitioner can certainly best be answered by a close examination into the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.579" offset="5254269">I'd like to talk first about the general fact background and later, more particularly about some of the specific testimony given by both police officers, the trial court and specially the defendant himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.555" offset="5338175">The general facts in chronological order went about as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.475" offset="5365864">On August 31, the lad disappeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.645" offset="5382478">At that time, the defendant was employed as a door-to-door solicitor and salesman on behalf of the Flood Music Company in Sioux City.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.043" offset="5420095">He was operating in the neighborhood in which the boy lived and from which he disappeared on the day that he did disappear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.785" offset="5459069">When the disappearance of the boy became generally known, a search was instituted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.573" offset="5478191">Also, word was passed to the police, to the Sioux City Police and thereupon on September 2nd, took him to the police station.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.630" offset="5522495">Shortly after he got to the police station, a private detective in Sioux City by the name of Matousec appeared and asked for a permission to question Triplett.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.735" offset="5578919">This was granted and there is no showing in the record that he was kept or in any way, inhibited from seeing the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.244" offset="5612878">Matousec's testimony was that he attempted to elicit information as to the crime by suggesting to the defendant that he would procure counsel for him, and this is substantiated by the defendant's testimony.</text>
