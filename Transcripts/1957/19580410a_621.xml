            <text syncTime="26.296" offset="105117">Mr. Rand, you may proceed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harry I. Rand</label>
            <text syncTime="28.166" offset="112640">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.878" offset="127478">This case like the preceding case involves the denial of a passport by the Secretary of State under section 51.135 of this Passport Regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.078" offset="180245">Unlike the previous case however, in this case, petitioner has filed an affidavit stating that he was never a member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.572" offset="214204">He has exhausted all the steps in the administered proceeding in the Department of State and nevertheless, more than four years after, the application was filed, he still stands here today by his counsel deprived of a passport and therefore barred under the presently effective provisions of law from travel abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.607" offset="298423">The petition here, Dr. Weldon Bruce Dayton is a physicist by education and training.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.831" offset="319321">He's a native-born American citizen, born -- post and just a bit more than 40 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.389" offset="345548">His specialty in physics as a result of his training has been on the field of Cosmic Ray Physical Research.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.987" offset="375850">The field that as I understand it, deals with researches in the elementary particles of matter and which as the record discloses without dispute, is completely non-classified, is completely without secrecy.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.274" offset="429035">On March 5, 1954, petitioner filed an application with Department of State to enable him to travel to India where he had been offered an appointment of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Bombay.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.264" offset="476996">The Tata Institute is a well-renowned educational institution attached and affiliated with the University of Bombay.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.752" offset="514926">Advised by the Director of the Passport Office that a passport would be refused to him because its issuance would be contrary to the best interest of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.327" offset="549303">Petitioner immediately sought an informal conference in the Passport Office and at that conference, petitioner and I as his council attended.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.336" offset="581277">Petitioner was interrogated, asked numerous questions by an official of the Passport Office, he answered all those questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.813" offset="611161">The official then suggested that the petitioner file an affidavit in which he would embody the answers of those questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.403" offset="637597">And so, petitioner prepared a comprehensive 22-paged, single-spaced, typewritten affidavit in which he set forth the details in which he thought the Passport Office would be interested.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.561" offset="682214">That affidavit appears at pages 10-42 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.681" offset="702694">And in that affidavit, at page 12 of the record, petitioner averred the record as this very large joint appendix, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.539" offset="734145">I'm sorry, we had to impose that on you but we have not been able to print the record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.005" offset="759954">At page 12 of the record, Your Honors will find the petitioner averred among other things in this affidavit as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.848" offset="791301">“I am not now and I've never been a member of the Communist Party with a possible exception of a casual and brief association with the work of the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee for a few months in 1941 and the 1942, I am not now and never have been a member of any of the organizations designated on the Attorney General's list which I have carefully examined.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.124" offset="872490">I am not now engaged and I have never engaged in any activities which so far as I know or at any time knew, support or supported the Communist movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.894" offset="907494">I wish to go abroad for the sole purpose of engaging in experimental research at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Bombay.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.567" offset="934243">I am not going abroad to engage in any activities which so far as I know or can imagine will in any way advance to Communist movement.”</text>
            <text syncTime="241.297" offset="965172">Notwithstanding this lengthy affidavit, the Passport Office persisted in his denial of a passport, and so petitioner, in accordance with the Passport Regulations, appealed to Board of Passport Appeals of the Department of State.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.490" offset="1013864">Several hearings were held before that Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.373" offset="1025463">The testimony adduced that those hearings both from petitioner and Dr. Corson, a professor of physics at Cornell University whom he called and three witnesses from the Board, called with respect to a single aspect with the charges against petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.659" offset="1078544">All their testimony is set forth in the record beginning with page 58 and continuing perhaps ad nauseam until page 270 of this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.343" offset="1125355">At the beginning of these hearings before the Board, it was made clear that despite the vigorous protest of petitioner, the Board would consider in making its determination and recommendation to the secretary confidential files of investigative reports which it said it had before it, reports derived from other Government agencies but which it said it would refuse to disclose to petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.696" offset="1226710">At that time, there was no summary afforded us.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.925" offset="1235696">At that that time however, when we requested certain particulars before the hearing, the Board advised -- Board's counsel advising us that they could not give us all the particulars we requested because of the security considerations involved, nevertheless, did afford us certain particulars.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.338" offset="1309257">And those particulars appear in the record at pages 48 and 49 of the record in the form of a letter addressed, “Dear Mr. Rand.”</text>
            <text syncTime="345.016" offset="1379997">We were never furnished with any report or recommendation from the Board of Passport Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.907" offset="1403611">We know that such a recommendation was made only because we were advised later that the Secretary of State had received it, so the Secretary advised us.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.058" offset="1432137">We were never furnished with an opportunity to appear and present our case before the Secretary of State himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.045" offset="1456170">In September of 1955, the Secretary advised the petitioner that a passport was being denied him under the provisions of Section 51.135 without specifying the particular provision or subsection of that section under which he was acting.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.731" offset="1534851">The provisions of Section 51.135 are set forth at page 2 of my brief, white-covered brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.243" offset="1564944">There was at that time no specification.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.344" offset="1577273">A complaint was filed in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.863" offset="1587409">Summary judgment was granted for the secretary in the District Court and appeal was then taken to the Court of Appeals, and after hearing by a three-judge panel, the -- the summary judgment granted for the Secretary was reversed and the case remanded to the Secretary for his reconsideration with the direction of the Secretary if he persisted in passport denial specify the particular subsection or subsections of 51.135 on which he was going to rely and further make specific findings with respect to petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.409" offset="1709558">Whereupon in October of 1956 without further hearing, the Secretary handed down the document designated decision and findings which is the document under review here and which appears at pages 275 to 278 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.196" offset="1768699">I shall in a moment address myself in some greater detail to the findings in that document.The -- the numbers by the way are in the bottom of the page.</text>

            <text syncTime="680.521" offset="2722064">In other words, he posits his passport denial here plainly on 51.135 (c), and 51.135 (c) is that provision which states that passports may be denied to persons regardless of their formal affiliation with the Communist Party who the Secretary has reason to believe are going abroad to engage in activities to advance the Communist movement purposefully and willfully to advance that movement.</text>

            <text syncTime="710.236" offset="2840869">He further says that the issuance of a passport here would be contrary to the national interest, and those are the two grounds on which he relies here for the passport denial.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.126" offset="2892487">Now, what is our contention first of course that the Secretary had no authority to deny a passport and thus to bar travel to this petitioner on this political ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.511" offset="2945985">And in that respect, we adopt the arguments which have been advanced by petitioners in the previous case.</text>

            <text syncTime="985.183" offset="3940728">The question I raise is whether there is any rational nexus which due process requires between the findings the Secretary has made and the conclusions he has reached.</text>

            <text syncTime="1017.375" offset="4069460">The Court will find that the first finding deals with the activity of Dr. Dayton in 1943 and 1944 while at the University of California as chairman of a -- an organization known as a Science for Victory Committee and his association as such chairman with three-named persons who had been instrumental in organizing that Science for Victory Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.587" offset="4178338">That is the finding on the open record, and then the Secretary tells us that confidential information indicates that the committee was conceived and organized by the Communist Party as a front for propaganda and espionage activities and the three-named persons were members of the party, the three-named persons here were members of the party at the time of their association with petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.414" offset="4253571">Then in paragraph II, we read the finding based on the open record with respect to an association for a four-year period in Ithaca, 1946 to 1950 between petitioner and one Sarant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.402" offset="4297561">Confidential information as for this matter, says the Secretary, establishes that Sarant was an active member of the Communist Party that he admitted said membership in 1943 and 1944, this was before his meeting as you -- as the Court will note with petitioner and that he was involved in Rosenberg espionage operators.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.635" offset="4370495">paragraph III deals with petitioner's presence during 1949 and 1950 on more than one occasion, in a New York City apartment building in which Sarant was lessee of an apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.753" offset="4415007">And the confidential information as for that, says the Secretary, indicates that Sarant's New York City apartment was used by Rosenberg and other members of his firing for microfilming classified U.S. Government documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.566" offset="4462237">paragraph IV deals with the association in continuing relationship of which by the way petitioner testified he was proud since 1938 with one Bernard Peters, Dr. Bernard Peters who now is at Tata Institute, although at -- in the next academic year as I've suggested that he has been invited to go to the Copenhagen Institute, the Bohr Institute for a year, his association with Dr. Bernard Peters who is responsible for petitioner's offer of employment to Tata Institute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.102" offset="4580310">And then confidential information indicates, says the Secretary that Dr. Peters has held membership in the Communist Party outside the United States, has engaged in numerous Communist activities both to this country and abroad and is suspected of being a Communist espionage agent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1262.757" offset="5050932">Now, the Court will note that this information referred to in paragraph V is not related to the four findings, and we have not a glimmer here in the record of what this information referred to in paragraph V may concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.689" offset="5102655">There is not the slightest hint of what this additional body of paragraph into my -- five information relates to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.046" offset="5136091">Now, based on all this confidential information including the paragraph V information and that the findings from the open record, the Secretary concluded as he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.533" offset="5170051">Note however what the Secretary has failed to find here, and to me, this is as significant as what he did find if not more significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.036" offset="5200144">He has not found any reason to believe anywhere in this entire record that petitioner ever knew that the Science for Victory Committee was organized by the Communist Party or for the improper purposes alleged or that the three-named persons associated with him were members of the Communist Party, or that petitioner himself and this is most significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.815" offset="5279242">There is no suggestion in this record that the Secretary has a reason to believe that petitioner himself ever engaged in Communist propaganda or espionage activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.497" offset="5317904">There is no such finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.926" offset="5323651">There is no such -- such suggestion in this entire decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.007" offset="5339951">The Secretary further hasn't found any reason to believe that Sarant's allegedly wrongful activities were contemporaneous with petitioner's association with him or that petitioner wasn't the least informed of such activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.366" offset="5389375">The Secretary hasn't found a reason to believe that petitioner's presence in the New York City apartment building which by the way he has steadfastly denied throughout many, many years but let's assume the presence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.399" offset="5433574">The Secretary hasn't found that his presence there was for any improper purpose or in the company of Sarant, or in the company of Rosenberg or even coincidentally calendar year with the alleged presence of Rosenberg and the other members of aspiring of such presence actually occurred in this apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.236" offset="5500865">The Secretary hasn't found reason to believe that petitioner has ever known of Dr. Peter's alleged Communist activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.260" offset="5525002">To the contrary, the Court will read this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.843" offset="5535347">The Court will find testimony of petitioner undisputed in the open record that Peters, he assure was never a member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.946" offset="5575784">They will find testimony of petitioner that so far as he knew, the Science for Victory Committee was not Communist-dominated because he wasn't a Communist and the policies of the Committee while he was chairman with his policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.144" offset="5616536">They will find testimony in this record that petitioner never knew Sarant to have engaged in Communist activities, so that was a fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.848" offset="5651331">In these circumstances, it seems clear to us that the -- the rational connection which is necessary which due process requires between the findings and -- and confidential information on the one hand even if we assume they are true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.652" offset="5706606">And what the Secretary says on the other is just lacking here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.799" offset="5719144">How can the Secretary reasonably find that because petitioner is innocently associated with one organization and in certain named-persons over a period of years and has been innocently present in an apartment building in the past that in 1956, he is going abroad to engage in activities to advance -- purposefully to advance the Communist movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.099" offset="5804304">As this Court has put it another case, the connection between the fact proved and that presumed is not sufficient, reasoning doesn't lead from one to the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.307" offset="5837218">Now, what -- how does the Government answer this argument?</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.265" offset="5845055">The Government has two answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.525" offset="5850070">The Government first says that it's reasonable to assume or rather, they put it in the negative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.589" offset="5878282">It's not reasonable -- not unreasonable to infer that petitioner's past activities and associations weren't the innocent ones that he's contended, but really were linked together by some common thread of close Communist involvement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.984" offset="5931886">Now, let me point out as I've said that the record nowhere supports such an inference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.394" offset="5945574">But even if the record did, the fact is that the Secretary hasn't made such an inference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.168" offset="5964591">And we -- as I understand it, are here today reviewing what the Secretary decided and what he said and what he found and not a belated gloss which the Secretary's lawyers put on his findings, not the act of thinking as one of the justices of this Court referred to such a process the other day, not the act of thinking of Government lawyers here as to what its determination should have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.737" offset="6062916">The second answer that the Government makes is stopping in its audacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.639" offset="6078485">The second answer the Government offers is, there maybe a hiatus between the findings and the confidential information on the one hand and then conclusions the Secretary reaches on the other, but we've got to assume that that hiatus is filled by this paragraph V undisclosed information about which we haven't the least hint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.650" offset="6154553">And why must we assume that, says the Government?</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.259" offset="6165002">We must assume that because in view of the fact that the Secretary tells us he can't tell us what that information is because it would affect foreign relations, it would not be unreasonable to assume that this information related more directly to the purposes of petitioner's travel than it did to his past activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.118" offset="6248385">Now again, I say first, that if the Secretary believes that or the Secretary should know, if this is what that information related to, then we certainly were entitled to have that in -- that statement made by the Secretary and he's not done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.259" offset="6300944">He hasn't told us what this paragraph V information concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.983" offset="6315886">And merely to have told us what it concerns, would not have breached any confidence but he has not made that statement and it is his lawyers who make it for the first time on this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.129" offset="6356428">Secondly, if these are the lacunae in administrative decisions, that is the lacunae between findings and conclusions, can be filled that a bottomless well of nebulous information such as we have here in paragraph V.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.451" offset="6409718">If in other words, unreason are illogic in administrative decisions can always be as I put it out, chemically converted to reason by resort to a body of secret information that the Government needs never supplied to the Court or to the agreed parties, then I don't think much is left of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.782" offset="6487040">One can always meet substantive due process efficiencies by resorting to this vast body of -- of state secrets which are state secrets solely of course on the ipse dixit of the Government officer involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.570" offset="6554227">It becomes plain, it seems to me, that these findings and this so-called relevant confidential information can assume significance or relevance to petitioner if they have any relevance to petitioner at all, only insofar as they reflect a judgment of guilt by association.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.606" offset="6622354">And as I read this case, and as I read it for many years, perhaps I'm too close to it, but as I've read for many years, this case is a rank case where we -- a rank example of an official judgment of vicarious guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.773" offset="6687033">No other way can one explain why this man is being denied in the constitutional right, and preceded the constitutional right on the basis of findings with respect to innocent association so far as the Secretary makes such findings, absolutely innocent associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.868" offset="6755370">Now, the Government says in answer to --</text>

            <text syncTime="1708.263" offset="6833006">I'd say for this reason, the Secretary makes four findings from the open record here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.998" offset="6867905">Three of those findings are derived solely from the information which my man gave, that is my client.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.896" offset="6895491">Notwithstanding that fact, because there's a conflict in evidence with respect in testimony, with respect to one aspect of these charges was petitioner present in this apartment building at any time because there's a conflict between petitioner's testimony and the testimony of the three custodial employees at that building which conflict maybe due to mistaken identification which is quite common in cases of this character.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.805" offset="6991203">Because of that one conflict, the Secretary in effect, and I say this advisedly, brands Dr. Dayton, a man of doubtful credibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.977" offset="7043866">And he says he has serious doubts as to the credibility -- general credibility of this witness.</text>

            <text syncTime="1852.294" offset="7409162">He has testified for -- since 1950 under oath that he's never been present.</text>

            <text syncTime="1886.903" offset="7547611">The record shows they were not called before the grand juries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.033" offset="7560046">I think their -- their testimony is incredible, but whether incredible or not, this -- the court knows, Professor Whitmore has said that there are more tragic miscarriages of justice in this field of identification testimony than anywhere else.</text>

            <text syncTime="1915.265" offset="7660983">Now, let me pass for the other aspect of due process which I think is extremely important here and that is the use of secret information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.678" offset="7690658">There's no question here that secret information was used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.424" offset="7705600">It was used excess -- extensively in this proceeding and there's no question that it painted every step of the administrative proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.440" offset="7749695">The Government argues and the court below erroneously assumed that the substance of this undisclosed information had been actually disclosed to petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.371" offset="7789401">And that's because of these -- these referrals with respect to each one of these four findings in the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.517" offset="7814060">The fact is however that that substance was not disclosed to petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.166" offset="7828584">What do we have?</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.641" offset="7834540">We have here at most a statement by the Secretary as to what he infers, what he infers from the confidential information that he's apparently read.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.230" offset="7880829">He gives his characterizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.457" offset="7889816">He gives us conclusions but we've never seen the tales, sources, substance of this information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.195" offset="7912699">Moreover, with respect to the paragraph V information if I may repeat what I've said before, we don't even have a hint as to what that concerns and the Government in its brief now tells us that that is extremely important that that is indeed the important information which fills the gap between -- in the reasoning between findings and conclusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.591" offset="8010292">There isn't time here in the few moments I have left to consider that in detail the conflicting interest between the citizen and the Government on this issue of non-disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.074" offset="8052193">Now, we are aware that this is a delicate problem where -- where it's a tough problem and the decisions of this Court in other connections which have tried to solve the problem attest I think to its difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.383" offset="8101512">There seems to us however a little question that in a case of this kind where we're dealing with a fundamental constitutional right that there can be no fair hearing as guaranteed by our Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.290" offset="8157100">When a citizen whose right has been abridged, can't even see the information which the Government office who will abridge us to that right tells him he's relied on and particularly where that information is as extensive as apparently it is in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.489" offset="8225855">There may be some justification for keeping secret this foreign relation's information, if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.098" offset="8244349">I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.657" offset="8246544">I certainly would urge there's none.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.230" offset="8256888">But the Government has admitted in its brief what is the fact here that the bulk of the information on which the Secretary relied on this case was not of that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.297" offset="8293146">The bulk of the information as the Government briefs -- Government's brief says at page 82, we must assume was derived from FBI reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.139" offset="8328464">It was the very kind of information which is predominated in all Government employee loyalty security programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.150" offset="8356571">As to such information, the Government has no real foreign affairs concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.701" offset="8370782">Its interest lie in -- in nondisclosure, is merely in trying to avoid the compromise as it were, compromise there would be of its sources and -- and methods of gathering together this information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.190" offset="8428669">And we suggest that there can be no fairer characterization of what kind of information this is than the characterization which Mr. Justice Frankfurter applied to it in his dissenting opinion in Jay against Boyd where Justice Frankfurter said, “We can take judicial notice of the fact that in conspicuous instances not negligible in number, such confidential information has turned out to be either baseless or false.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.473" offset="8521874">There is no reason to believe that only these conspicuous instances illustrate the hazards inherent in taking action affecting the lives of fellowmen on the basis of such information, the probabilities under the contrary.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.573" offset="8566282">And recent history, particularly other these cases in this Court I think, eloquently support this view.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.003" offset="8591987">The Secretary himself has no confidence in this information as his own decision may explain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.898" offset="8619572">If the Court please, turn to pages 276 and 277 of the record and note what the Secretary of State, an able lawyer and draftsman does with respect to his references to confidential information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.636" offset="8682475">As to finding I -- I (b), the Court will note that the Secretary says that that confidential information indicates this, the -- the matters he refers to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.092" offset="8732317">As to finding II, he says confidential information establishes certain things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.232" offset="8752901">As to finding III, confidential information indicates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.534" offset="8766067">As to finding IV, confidential information indicates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.712" offset="8778815">It seems plain to us that the Secretary himself has no confidence in these informers, the identity of whom he himself has admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.376" offset="8817476">In other cases, he sometimes doesn't know and the reliability of whom therefore he cannot vouch for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.207" offset="8856764">Moreover, let me point to finding 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.944" offset="8871706">Note that the Secretary says that confidential information indicates that Dr. Peters, not is -- is an espionage agent but is a suspected espionage agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.692" offset="8918727">That indeed is surmised hit on suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.867" offset="8943386">Now, this vice that follows from the use of secret information is particularly vicious in a case of this kind where we have no congressional authorization for the procedures which have been followed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.755" offset="9002945">Perhaps the Congress does permit the establishment of political standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.000" offset="9015902">We urge it does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.520" offset="9022067">But one thing is clear and the Government cannot -- certainly will not urge the -- the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.209" offset="9040771">The Congress nowhere has stated in any statute unequivocally and unambiguously that the traditional modes of justice and due process can be departed from in a case of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.055" offset="9092180">And this Court's prior decisions as I read them where it may have sanctioned to some extent the use of confidential information, certainly have not dealt with cases of fundamental constitutional rights abridged through the use of such information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.142" offset="9156545">Surely, we have decisions where this Court has recognized that the President in the -- in -- in the true foreign relations here involving negotiations with Government et cetera, may rely on secret information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.252" offset="9208999">We did not disclose that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.733" offset="9214851">In the alien cases, we're dealing with a question of privilege as it were of race rather than right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.930" offset="9243690">And similarly, in Jay against Boyd, we were dealing with matter of grace.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.052" offset="9260199">In the Nugent case dealing with the consciences objectors, the Court will remember that that case was decided on the very basic consideration as this Court later stated in its Simmons decision, that the confidential information there was used only incidental to an advisory opinion of the -- of the Department of Justice and not in connection with the final determination affecting rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.102" offset="9356330">So I do not see that there can be any question that any prior decisions of this Court compel a result here sanctioning the use of confidential information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.740" offset="9402932">Now, one furthermore matter and then I'd like to reserve a few minutes which I may have for rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.840" offset="9427278">Let me point to the vagueness of grounds which -- of the grounds used by the Secretary here, relied on by the Secretary which I've already averted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.428" offset="9461656">We have sought for four years now in State Department and the Courts to find out just what it is the Secretary fears that petitioner will do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.544" offset="9510139">We've asked for some specification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.731" offset="9518916">What is it you fear this petitioner will do?</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.423" offset="9529678">Perhaps if we found out what it was, the Secretary was worried about, the petitioner might give him some assurance that he wouldn't engage in the activities that the Secretary was worried about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.557" offset="9570220">The Secretary has persistently and consistently refused to specify what he has in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.072" offset="9592268">And so on these grounds, these very vague grounds here, the fact is that petitioner for a lifetime assuming the emergency continues for a lifetime, can never hope to expurgate himself from this (Inaudible) like web that has been woven about him by these very ambiguous standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.402" offset="9665515">He cannot of course turn the clock back and disassociate himself from the people he's associated with in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.171" offset="9692682">He cannot know what to do with respect to his overseas activities because he doesn't know what the Secretary fears he may do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.441" offset="9725701">And he said, “All I want to do is do search at Tata Institute.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.084" offset="9744300">For these various reasons and for the others stated in our brief, we think that there can be no question here that even assume authority in the Secretary to control travel on the basis of these standards, there has been a very drastic and unjust violation of due process in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.519" offset="9810024">And I'd like to reserve --</text>

            <text syncTime="3013.129" offset="12052480">Now, it's the question of what inferences a person who were judging facts would ordinarily draw from those relationships, and the fact that Sarant was supposed to have been going down to this place, 65 Morton Street, during this period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.422" offset="12133669">And what he might have been able to know and probably knew that he claimed he knew nothing about this place was never there and these people identified him.</text>

            <text syncTime="4122.932" offset="16491624">The Court might proceed that, require him to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="4128.107" offset="16512418">I think the problem in regard to confidential information of the FBI as I've indicated is a different problem, and a more difficult problem for the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="4139.559" offset="16558184">It's a question of protecting the sources of information and the conduct of intelligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4147.839" offset="16591308">Now, those persons who examine the question are responsible people, it seems to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="4156.340" offset="16625267">The committee on the security and the Government had made their report in which they indicate that there should be as much disclosure as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="4164.577" offset="16658286">And Professor Jaffe has indicated that its probably a ground for withholding an order to protect the intelligence system of a country so it can be able to carry on and get the necessary information that it has to.</text>
            <text syncTime="4181.580" offset="16726309">And there are other responsible groups, Association of Bar of The City of New York examining to this question carefully and they came up with the same suggestion that if the disclosure should go as far as it -- it can be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="4197.755" offset="16790988">But there -- there's probably an area that has to be withheld in order to protect the greater interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4204.654" offset="16818573">And I think that's the matter which we discussed at some length in our brief and I'll leave it there except with the suggestion that Parker against Lester, that's referred to by counsel, is quite a different case than this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4219.852" offset="16879386">And that here, the substance of the various matters involved the confidential information except to form theories was made known to the petitioner and the record shows that he had addressed himself to all of that material and he tried to -- to answer if -- and he frankly admitted some parts of the information that was available and tried to explain in a way.</text>
            <text syncTime="4246.858" offset="16987429">So everything that was involved in that type of information, we think he was not damaged by no further disclosure and that he had chance to cross-examine in regard to these others.</text>
            <text syncTime="4260.039" offset="17040091">But in Parker against Lester if you recall, they --</text>

            <label>Mr. Harry I. Rand</label>
            <text syncTime="4314.608" offset="17258371">I -- I just have a few things to say if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="4318.596" offset="17274358">First, with respect to the reference that has been made to the renunciation of American citizenship by Dr. Peters.</text>
            <text syncTime="4325.216" offset="17300793">I have always -- always since the decision came down but unable to understand the relevance of that reference which the Secretary makes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4335.078" offset="17340291">I'd always assume as this Court only recently affirmed the other day that the right of expatriation, the right of voluntary renunciation of citizenship had always been a valued right of an American and that one should not therefore suggest any inference as the Secretary apparently does here that when a person renounces his citizenship, he is to be suspected.</text>
            <text syncTime="4355.453" offset="17421793">Particularly so in the case of Dr. Peters who was a German citizen and who came here to escape Nazi persecution, became a naturalized American citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="4366.411" offset="17465574">And naturally after the war resumed as I understand it, West German citizenship, so that he could again -- as it were assumed, the citizenship of his native land.</text>
            <text syncTime="4378.426" offset="17513639">Reference was made to the question of Sarant's running off with petitioner's wife, unfortunately that is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="4386.069" offset="17544255">The petitioner has suffered there as well as from the Secretary of State.</text>
            <text syncTime="4389.587" offset="17558256">I don't know however -- I don't know however, if any other case where a person has been branded for associating, perhaps he should be, for associating with the person who runs off with his wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="4401.103" offset="17604336">I again do not quite understand the reference which the Secretary makes there as perhaps suggesting an inference that petitioner had something as engaged in wrongful activities with Sarant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4413.656" offset="17654596">I should think petitioner's wife did rather than petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="4416.985" offset="17667866">Third, as to the January 1950, as to the presence of the apartment building, now, the Solicitor General has stated here that we have here merely a testimony of one as against another, a no as against a yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4431.184" offset="17724709">Well, there is something more than that in this record as the Court will note if the Court examines the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4436.733" offset="17746860">When petitioner was first charged with presence of the apartment building, the FBI agents who suggested as to whom also suggested the month of January 1950 as being the date when he was present -- present there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4448.476" offset="17793881">And, if the Court will note that at page 167 to page 169 or 170 of the record, petitioner documents practically everyday in the month of January 1950 when fortunately he could document everyday because he was busy practically everyday and sometimes during the nights working at the cyclotron at Cornell University with a view toward completing his PhD thesis.</text>
            <text syncTime="4474.690" offset="17898684">So he was able to put himself at Ithaca practically everyday of that month.</text>
            <text syncTime="4479.483" offset="17917910">Well, as the proceeding went on, the -- the dates began to shift, and if Your Honors will examine the -- the lengthy footnote I have set forth on pages 56 and 58 of my brief, the petitioner's brief analyzing the testimony of these three custodial employees, Your Honors will note how in their testimony as they testify on the one day, their dates keep shifting around like quicksand.</text>
            <text syncTime="4504.628" offset="18018429">And we've often wondered, petitioner certainly has, just when -- when this -- this merry-go-round stops.</text>
            <text syncTime="4510.247" offset="18040895">He has documented January 1950, a suggestion was made as to July or August of 1949 and he sought to document that, sought to testify as to that and the dates change.</text>

            <text syncTime="4536.330" offset="18145280">The Secretary says on more than one occasion in 1949 and 1950, there is no specification of date.</text>
            <text syncTime="4542.620" offset="18170462">Indeed the Secretary does not find the petitioner was present as charged in the Sarant apartment.</text>

            <text syncTime="4551.907" offset="18207556">Yes, January 1950 and July or August of 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="4556.533" offset="18226051">We know those two -- those two dates and we sought to meet them at the hearing but they've shifted, continually shifted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4565.543" offset="18262100">Some reference has been made, fact that the Solicitor General no more than myself knows just what the Secretary has considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="4571.785" offset="18287073">And perhaps therefore, we're not qualified to say whether there is any justification in keeping secret confidential information.</text>
            <text syncTime="4579.567" offset="18318211">But there is one man who I think is qualified and that is our former Secretary of State, Dean Acheson, who -- who promulgated these regulations we have attacked here and who undoubtedly had some familiarity with the proceedings under them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4594.410" offset="18377561">And as I have quoted at page 33 of our brief, Mr. Dean Acheson, now a private citizen, writing in his volume of democrat looks at his party, characterizes these regulations, these very procedure is a grave mistake and a failure to force the consequences which were inevitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4614.907" offset="18459585">And he characterizes the practice of secret evidence and secret informants which the regulation has sanctioned as alien to our conception of justice and the rights of the citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="4624.936" offset="18499709">Now, I think the former Secretary of State should know a little about how these procedures worked because as this Court knows, knows as well as myself, we're not dealing with a monolithic structure called the Secretary of State.</text>
            <text syncTime="4639.463" offset="18557806">I too have worked in the Government, and when we speak of the Secretary of State, we realize that there are numerous subordinates who enter into these decisions and he's not merely the one responsible individual who reads this record carefully from beginning to end.</text>
            <text syncTime="4651.892" offset="18607543">Thank you very much.</text>
