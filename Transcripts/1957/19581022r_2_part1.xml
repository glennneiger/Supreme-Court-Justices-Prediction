            <text syncTime="27.100" offset="211780">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.578" offset="225677">This case like the preceding case just before the Court reargued.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.297" offset="264547">Present case finds its origin in an indictment of petitioner in -- in May of 1944 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, Southern Division, the indictment had three counts, the first count alleged that the petitioner and the one Cameron, conspired to violate Section 254 of former title 18 and that by means or rather that they're conspired by a means of deadly and dangerous weapons to commit the assault on agents of the Alcohol Tax Unit of the Internal Revenue Service of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.859" offset="502784">The second count alleges that -- that on or about the same date, May 22 of 1944, the defendant, by means and use of deadly and dangerous weapons, to wit, loaded shotguns forcibly assaulted a man named Reed, who was an agent of the Alcohol Tax Unit on account of its performance of his official duties and while he was engaged in the performance of such duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.454" offset="633187">And that the two defendants shot and seriously wounded that patient.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.564" offset="657638">The third count is the same as the second count, except that a different agent of the tax unit named Frost, was the victim of the alleged assault.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.432" offset="737050">In June 1944, on the 23rd day of the month, the petitioner was arraigned, ended a plea of not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.710" offset="786160">On that same day, he was tried by a jury and found guilty as charged on all counts and on the same day he was sentenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.713" offset="826180">The practices he only matter was this before this Court held that the petitioner is conceded and he has been punished, we think, already for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.699" offset="878216">The sentence on the first count, the conspiracy count, was for two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.330" offset="908727">On the second count, 10 years and the sentence on the first count was to run concurrently with the sentence on the second count.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.534" offset="953553">The sentence on the third year -- on the third count, was an additional 10 years and that was to be consecutive and meant running at the expiration of the sentence on the second count.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.223" offset="1008306">In other words, petitioner was sentenced for 20 years.</text>

            <text syncTime="281.405" offset="1228988">There is no transcript of evidence taken at the trial and no appeal from the original conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.283" offset="1260544">The present proceedings commenced in January of 1955 and the petitioner, brought a motion in the trial court, where he was originally convicted and sentenced pursuant to Section 2255 of title 28, to correct his sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.681" offset="1354062">His motion alleged, with the second and third count charged, with a single offense and start to have the sentences under those two counts amended so that they would run concurrently, and therefore, he would have served his full sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.627" offset="1437863">Now, the motion was drawn by the petitioner without any professional assistance, I think, and it doesn't clearly state whether or not, there was only one shot fired in accordance with the allegations of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.131" offset="1523858">But that claim is implicit in the brief in support of the motion and the case has been treated below on the assumption that the claim made by the petitioner is simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.310" offset="1580596">That since he discharged the shotgun only once and struck to agents that the single discharge of the weapon was only a single violation of the statute and therefore, it was unlawful to -- to sentence him, at least, for two separate offenses under Section 254.</text>

            <text syncTime="462.531" offset="1953520">I thought the fact it was a shotgun means that it -- this shoots a -- fires a cartridge that is filled with small lead pellets.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harold Rosenwald</label>
            <text syncTime="471.977" offset="1991241">That is exactly my (Inaudible) and I say Mr. Justice Whittaker, that the record -- we have no real record on the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.015" offset="2055398">There has been no -- no extra testimony as to the nature of the charge refused or how it was fired.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.657" offset="2082043">My impression, I think, it's been assumed throughout this case, if that's exactly what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.705" offset="2102209">There was -- or at least there's a claim that's made.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.438" offset="2113076">There was one package, the pellet scattered and struck two further (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="507.487" offset="2133347">I -- I drew the case on that assumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.463" offset="2149230">The motion under Section 2255 was denied -- the motion under Section 2255 was denied by Judge Myers, the trial judge, he based his decision on several grounds, first, that he personally remembers that there was more than -- that the evidence showed that there was more than one shot fired.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.773" offset="2326444">I point out that the trial had taken place about ten-and-a-half years before and the judge may have had a good many other cases in the meantime.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.046" offset="2375555">He admitted however that no transcript had been taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.984" offset="2399274">He stated quite erroneously that the same motion has been made by the petitioner before the Court of Appeals has ruled out the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.636" offset="2433964">There's no question here at this time that petitioner is making his request for relief under 2255 a second time.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.686" offset="2474088">The judge was confused to train the petitioner and his codefendant Cameron and the only one who's made a motion before was Cameron and not petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.573" offset="2521631">But the basis, I suppose, on which Judge Myers clearly based his decision was that the single discharge of those weapons the -- this weapon which has an impact onto federal officials, constitutes not one, but two offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.587" offset="2613687">So if that is true, the motion was properly denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.722" offset="2638242">The Court of Appeals on the petitioner's appeal in the form of (Inaudible) affirmed the judgment of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.051" offset="2695607">The Court of Appeals reviewed the record, pointed out that there was no offense we've taken, so that there was no proper record before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.154" offset="2743986">That nevertheless, there appeared in the record and the Court doesn't quite know how it got there, but I think the record in this Court shows that the United States Attorney put it there or had the clerk put it there.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.470" offset="2805217">An affidavit of a man named (Inaudible) who was -- his brother-in-law of these two defendants in which the affiant stated that he had heard five shots when he was -- when half a mile away from the place where he had seen the petitioner and Cameron, some minutes before.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.770" offset="2938441">That's the -- there's no other evidentiary matter in the record except for that grossly improper affidavit that doesn't belong here at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.439" offset="2985148">The Court of Appeals stated that this affidavit of Mr. (Inaudible) should be disregarded that there was nothing in the -- oh, and that the judge's personal recollection should also be disregarded that this left the record completely void of any evidence could ever -- that there was more than one shot.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.876" offset="3098833">They took the motion of petitioner to allege that there was only one shot and said that if a single shot constituted only one violation of the statute, then the petitioner would be entitled to a hearing under Section 2255, that which he could be personally present and endeavor to show that there was indeed only a single shot.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.679" offset="3214085">However, said the Court of Appeals, the single shot which affects as an impact on two federal agents constitutes two assaults under the statute and that therefore, the motion was properly denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.914" offset="3287019">Because even if the petitioner could show that there was only discharge of the gun, the admission that two people were injured by the -- established sufficient to support the sentence in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.661" offset="3346056">The Court of Appeals relied in its original opinion upon certain decisions in its own circuit, its own decision under the Mann Act, from which that Court of Appeals have felt that there are more than woman this Court has for moral purposes into the -- in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.268" offset="3436440">There are as many violations to the Mann Act as there are women transported, even though the transportation takes place at one in the same time and in the same vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.957" offset="3483251">At the time the opinion was written by the Court of Appeals, this Court has already ruled to the contrary in the Bell case.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.876" offset="3518882">Apparently that the case has been overlooked by the Court of Appeals when it was brought to the Court's attention, they mentioned the case and then said, well, anyway, they thought there were to result in this case, so they affirmed the judgment of the --- of Judge Myers.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.130" offset="3619924">The case was then brought here by a petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.680" offset="3654092">And it is here and whether the petitioner was allowed to proceed in forma pauperis.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.119" offset="3691813">As I've stated before, petitioner is now on parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.539" offset="3713546">I don't think I need to spend a time of this Court arguing that the cases is moot on that account.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.243" offset="3740296">He's still under certain obligations as the parolee maybe returned to prison to serve the balance of his term if he misbehaves and violates the terms of his parole agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.023" offset="3787421">And I would suppose that under the decisions of this Court in Pittsburgh against the United States and U.S. against Morgan, more recently in Pollard against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.513" offset="3825455">There's no question the case is not moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.418" offset="3853040">We come then to the merits of petitioner's claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.877" offset="3874879">The statute in this case is no longer apparently criminal code and has been replaced under the revisions of the code, I think, in 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.788" offset="3966516">The statute has two clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.813" offset="3998595">First, the first clause makes is -- is an offense to forcibly resist, oppose, impede, intimidate or interfere with certain federal officials while they're engaged in the performance of official duties or to assault section of an official on account of his official duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.367" offset="4096815">That is the first clause and there is a penalty of three years and a fine for violation of that clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.207" offset="4128162">The Second clause makes any defense to use a deadly or dangerous weapon in the commission of any of the Acts described in the section itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.111" offset="4183855">And for that, there is a penalty of 10 years and a fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.836" offset="4214680">We contend that the second clause condemns the use of a dangerous weapon and that the unit of prosecution is the use of a dangerous or deadly weapon and that the consequences of that use are not material.</text>

            <text syncTime="1828.826" offset="7418650">The statute can be examined on its face and this problem disposed off without any authority because this is a new question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.381" offset="7464939">There is no decision on the precise question here under this statute or any exactly similar statute, inquire in every case is one of the statutory constructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.271" offset="7512482">And I don't -- we don't even get to any authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.383" offset="7532857">However, the -- the Court of Appeals and the District Court, in passing on petition on this motion, treated the statute as if it were an assault with a deadly weapon statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.548" offset="7621569">They said there were two assaults because there were two agents, and they relied upon the language in the statute, whoever resist or assault any person -- any person, a single object of the verbs they talked me that it was a separate offense with respect to each person affected by the acts of the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.542" offset="7765556">Or to put it otherwise, they read the statute to -- to -- as if it provided and whoever wounds any federal officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.486" offset="7801292">And taking it on that basis and passing my first contention, if the statute provided whoever results any person with a dangerous weapon, or whoever wounds any federal official, then we come to the problem that is before this Court, in the Bell case, in the Prince case, in the Universal C.I.T. Corporation case, and most recently in the Gore case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.249" offset="7924381">And I would accept those cases now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.633" offset="7949876">Bell, as what we recall, involved a transportation of two women across state lines for immoral purposes, at the same time and in the same vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.245" offset="8000345">And this Court held that it was -- that the question before the Court was to determine the intention of Congress as to whether Congress intended to punish the -- intended to regard each of the transportation of each -- each woman, a number of women transported, measure the number of offenses of the statute, or the Act of transportation itself was new to the prosecution and it didn't matter how many people were involved in the transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.174" offset="8152064">This was a question of the intention of Congress as to what punishments are contemplated as to what was the unit of crime denounced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.291" offset="8196577">And that in determining this question, the Court finding the statute too ambiguous and uncertain, was endeavored to search in the legislative history of the statute, with any help it could be fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.866" offset="8254882">Grasping its drawers, if necessary and it's frequently is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.893" offset="8270973">And to determine what Congress intended from that legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.328" offset="8300648">And if the legislative history were neutral or didn't clearly show that Congress intended multiple punishments, then the doubt would be resolved in favor of the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.545" offset="8361566">And it would not be assumed that Congress intended to provide for multiple punishments for a single criminal act, unless it was clearly stated in some way either in the statute or in its legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.800" offset="8426559">And it was stated in the Bell case that Congress could make explicit provisions that it was easy enough for it to provide as a transportation of each woman would be a separate offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.206" offset="8484237">And thus having failed to do so, this Court would apply the usual rule of state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.955" offset="8507225">This is an application of the rule of strict construction criminal statutes and would not find multiple offenses and allow multiple punishments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.897" offset="8566993">The Bell case was followed by Universal C.I.T. Corporation case, which involved the continuous crime more like the old cohabitation cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.235" offset="8616312">But -- but in that Universal C.I.T. case, the Court repeated its general rule that -- and particularly in a criminal statute, we will look for explicit provisions for penalties and where they're not present, we will give the accused the benefit of the doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.612" offset="8721847">Prince was based on the same ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.267" offset="8740446">The legislative history of the statute was examined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.311" offset="8760613">There was some evidence in that legislative history that Congress didn't intend to punish a man for entering a bank for the intent to commit a robbery and also for the robbery, it was somewhat like prosecuting of him for attempt to commit a crime and also for the completed offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.394" offset="8860923">In the last term, the Court had before the Gore case which I have discussed in my supplemental brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.035" offset="8907525">The Gore case is a narcotics case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.601" offset="8941798">And the accused in that case was charged by -- in connection with a single sale of narcotics, where they're actually two separate sales, but with respect to each such sale, he was charged with three violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.680" offset="9006059">Sales, violating for statutes that prohibited the sale of narcotic drugs not in the original stamped package, the violation of the statute thus forbade the sale of narcotics drug except on a written order of the purchasers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.946" offset="9083173">And finally under the Tariff Act, I think, facilitating and concealing the sale of narcotics drugs, knowing that they've been unlawfully imported.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.409" offset="9157047">This Court held in the Gore case that the document in the Bell case would not be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.553" offset="9209605">It was pointed out in the majority of opinion that these three statutes which the accused had violated had been adopted at different times and were totally separate statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.339" offset="9276688">And most important, I think, that the entire history of the narcotics legislations showed the strong almost frantic efforts of Congress to stamp out the narcotics trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.492" offset="9333321">So where there was no scope at all for the application, at least, the majority of this Court itself, of the principle in the Bell case in any narcotics case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.030" offset="9371460">The Court was also confronted with the Blockburger case, which was a brilliant point and had decided these questions some years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.140" offset="9423914">The present case is -- is different from the Gore case, as the Bell case is different from the Gore case, and the Gore case sharply distinguished the Bell case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.855" offset="9478771">On the ground, there was only a single statutory provision involved in the Bell case and that there was no history of these efforts of Congress to provide ever increasing penalties in an effort to stay involved in the narcotics trade as in this -- the Gore case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.806" offset="9562572">The present case is very similar to the Bell case, as only dealing with a single statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.442" offset="9593187">One -- in fact, one clause of a single statute, there is no such history as we have in the narcotics legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.568" offset="9641671">I don't mean to suggest in any way that assaulting federal officers in the performance of their duties is not a serious offense, but there's -- it just doesn't have this kind of -- of strenuous efforts to the Congress to bring more and more severe penalties into play, in an attempt to stop the narcotics trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.258" offset="9760371">The closest case that we have then is Bell against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.741" offset="9790360">And however, there are other cases that I'd like to mention briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.237" offset="9840306">Or rather proposes as mentioned personally, the legislative history of this statute, I've examined it in my brief, its set forth there, all that's available of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.910" offset="9895058">There isn't very much.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.456" offset="9905194">With respect to this particular statute, there is evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.001" offset="9927346">The Department of Justice introduced this statute into Congress in 1934, I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.947" offset="9959111">The -- in a letter from the Attorney General to the Chairman of the respective House committees hearing the Bell, the Attorney General referred to several other federal statutes been in existence the purpose of which was to protect federal officers in the performance of their duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.422" offset="10061093">A couple of those statutes had a provision making it a crime to wound a federal officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.375" offset="10096828">This statute has no such provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.501" offset="10117413">From that I argue, though I'll admit the argument doesn't have overwhelming force, that there was no intention in this case to denounce a crime of wounding a federal officer and that the statute was intended to say no more and appears on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.930" offset="10203094">Now, as the Chief Justice pointed out, there's a turning opinion in the Gore case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.750" offset="10230366">The problem of finding the intention of Congress in the legislative history in these cases is a difficult one and somewhat frustrating.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.123" offset="10271848">Nobody seems to have to write questions on the -- wrote Congress, if someone would only get up and say what happens if he shoots a gun and it hits two people and -- and we would know a little more than we do what Congress intended in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2718.943" offset="10979140">And I -- and the Gore case didn't exactly went principle of (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.869" offset="11002859">The Gore case steps so prior to the principle, but found evidence of congressional intention to be extremely severe in narcotics cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.981" offset="11039326">So that -- those narcotic cases stand off as another -- be held or they‘re consistent with the principle or in application of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.657" offset="11086033">Well, I really like to mention these -- these other cases, if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.265" offset="11108394">The mailbag cases, for some strange reason, cutting the mailbag although the bag would seem to be the same where you cut several mailbags, there's a separate offense with respect to each mailbag.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.095" offset="11163773">That's the decision of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.117" offset="11171819">The Courts of Appeals have followed that decision in Ebeling against Morgan, which is cited in my brief, but have not -- has followed that where there was a cutting involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.446" offset="11221138">But where there was an effect of mailbags or processed from a single mailbag, some of the courts that appealed have found that there was only a single offense committed and they distinguished the Ebeling case on the ground that there is more than one act in this which is currently you have to have a separate stroke of the knife for these mailbags to be cut, that if you get a real wide -- wherever you can carry a weight of several mailbags at the same time, that was the only one act and therefore, only one offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.618" offset="11349870">I've seen those mailbags.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.995" offset="11359378">I don't see how they do it, but -- [Laughter] the bank robbery cases were headed by Prince against the United States, remember that the application, one-third of the bank robbery statutes tendering a bank with intent to commit a felony and robbing the bank is only one offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.405" offset="11465017">And there -- because I said, the Court have applied their general principle of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.799" offset="11490617">More interesting, for that purpose, is the cases under the section of the Bank Robbery Law, which makes in a -- a criminal offense to put the lives of its -- the life of a -- any person in jeopardy, of any person in jeopardy, in the commission of the -- a bank robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.036" offset="11583509">Three Courts of Appeals, in the Fifth Circuit, the Sixth Circuit and the Ninth Circuit have held that there is only one offense, no matter how many persons' lives were put in jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.166" offset="11668041">And the singular language appears, any person putting in jeopardy the life of any person that appears in the bank statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.460" offset="11705240">It appears in the Mann Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.453" offset="11713181">And it's the usual language of statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.861" offset="11722794">So the singular, any person despite of the Government's argument, I don't think, helps very much in the decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.599" offset="11769814">There are state court decisions, unrelated questions and that they are in hopeless conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.551" offset="11817566">I don't think they help very much except to say that where a matter comes up in the state court, that this Court held in the (Inaudible) against New Jersey, last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.140" offset="11863960">The State has a right to decide that there are separate individual robberies, where several persons had robbed at the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.965" offset="11919235">That was not a decision of this Court, but there were several robberies, or as many as separate crimes with respect to each person robbed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.370" offset="11964897">This Court simply said, “If the State of New Jersey wants to so hold, that's not a denial of due process.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.239" offset="11996348">And there are cases in accord in other states and there are cases to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.050" offset="12031561">In any offense, the state court cases and the common law cases have very little to do with determining under the decisions of this Court, the intention of Congress which is a controlling criterion for the decisions here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.651" offset="12089971">And the intention of Congress in enacting this particular statute is what we are concerned with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.394" offset="12120900">And I think I've pointed it right, for the determination of their intention.</text>

            <text syncTime="3020.691" offset="12186102">As counsel for petitioner has indicated this is a punishment case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.836" offset="12210761">The questions involved in this case are solely ones of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.976" offset="12239287">In the next case that the Court will hear, the Abbate case, we will return to problems of successive trials by State and Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.221" offset="12280247">Problems of -- of double jeopardy and federal supremacy, but there are no constitutional problems in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.166" offset="12316087">There are no problems of successive trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.569" offset="12333641">The problem is one of concerning the intent of Congress, the unit of crime which Congress indicated, it intended in this particular statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.742" offset="12378363">It is the Government's position that this statute which deals with a crime of violence against the person and uses the term “assault” a term which has a recognized and defined meaning at the common law, makes the unit of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.879" offset="12462895">Each individual federal officer assaulted with the intent which the statute requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.283" offset="12504482">And it is clear, we believe, that at the common law, where a person intends a crime of violence against the person, each victim constitutes a separate crime and we have -- we have summarized in our brief, the state court cases to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.602" offset="12625795">Or it emphasized that we're dealing in that statute with the clause or shall assault him on account of the performance of his official duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.303" offset="12672606">There is other language in the statute, but that does not -- the language which appears in Counts 2 and 3 of the indictment, which are the counts which are now before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.282" offset="12712521">So this -- the problem before the Court is what did Congress mean when it says, “Assault him, the federal officer, on account of the performance of his official duties.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.947" offset="12763199">Required that there'd be an intent on the part of the defendant to direct an assault against each particular federal officer.</text>

            <text syncTime="5083.893" offset="20438915">Suppose the Government sends 10 officers to -- to arrest the man who - who's a pretty husky fellow and -- and they close in on him and he starts to resist and he -- he just fights the whole outfit and strikes it all of them until they finally suppress him.</text>
            <text syncTime="5102.673" offset="20514043">Would you say that he had committed 10 crimes and he could be sent to penitentiary for 30 years instead of just three years, because there were 10 men present and he -- he struggled with them and resisted and impeded and -- and did all the other things that -- that the Act says.</text>
            <text syncTime="5123.423" offset="20597112">He assaulted them too, and would you say that the Congress would intend that in that situation that they could charge 10 crimes against him and convict him of and sends him to the penitentiary for 30 years instead of three?</text>

            <label>Mr. Leonard B. Sand</label>
            <text syncTime="5139.929" offset="20663045">I think that Congress intended to protect each of the officers against bodily assault.</text>
            <text syncTime="5146.819" offset="20690631">I think -- I think that was the request which was directed to the Congress to protect the federal officers against assault.</text>
            <text syncTime="5154.493" offset="20721351">I think to take a hypothetical rather close to Mr. Justice Frankfurter's hypothetical, I think if a defendant lying his victims up, if he require that his victims to stand directly next to each other and fired a shotgun at them, one pulling of the trigger and they die, I think that would be 2 murders.</text>
            <text syncTime="5184.044" offset="20839528">Counsel for petitioner concedes that if the statute said wounds, whoever wounds a federal officer and that shotgun trigger was -- was pulled once and wounded both the officers that would be two crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5200.859" offset="20906820">I think similarly because Congress can't protect officers against assaults, as well as against wounds, and against murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="5211.297" offset="20948511">There would be -- there would be a crime with respect to each person towards whom the -- the defendant intended to direct a bodily injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="5223.679" offset="20998040">I think -- I think that every case which has dealt with an injury to the person in which there was an intent to inflict injury to the person has held the unit of the crime is the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="5241.549" offset="21069615">I would like straightly to call the Court's attention to the procedural problem which is involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5253.920" offset="21119039">It's a problem that of diminishing importance because it -- it -- that this case was tried at the time when the federal law did not acquire that there'd be a transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="5265.985" offset="21167313">And there's a serious question which has never been decided by this Court whether you can in a proceeding under 2255 challenge a -- a conviction and have a hearing, the purpose of which is to ascertain what the evidence was which was introduced at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="5289.982" offset="21263339">In the Bell case or in the Prince case there was no -- there was no problem as to whether the facts constituted whether there was one transportation or -- or several.</text>
            <text syncTime="5300.381" offset="21304926">This was -- this was conceded.</text>
            <text syncTime="5303.594" offset="21317778">But here, the Government, of course, cannot concede that there was only -- only one shot fired of each indication to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="5312.257" offset="21352364">So petitioner is requesting that he be given a hearing the purpose of which would be to establish what the testimony was that was adduced at the trial which took place some -- some 13 or some years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="5328.853" offset="21418820">And presumably that -- that testimony will be -- will be in conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="5333.616" offset="21437837">The judge -- the trial judge indicated that his recollection was, that there was -- that there was more than one shots fired.</text>
            <text syncTime="5340.445" offset="21465109">And -- and proceeding on the assumption that it somehow makes a difference how many shots were fired even though both counsel for petitioner and -- and for the Government concede its number of shots, you don't have to fire the gun at all, to constitute himself.</text>

            <text syncTime="5363.795" offset="21558523">Well, if that -- if that be the case, I -- I -- my impression was that it took no position that's left, but if that be the case -- if that is the material factor whether the defendant was -- was a -- a good enough marksman and used a -- a weapon capable of inflicting multiple injury and was -- was a good enough criminal marksman, so that he could -- he could wound these two with -- with one act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5391.025" offset="21667506">If -- if that -- if that is the issue, we question whether that the purpose of a hearing under 2255 to resolve disputes at the testimony which was introduced at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="5406.710" offset="21730200">Now, clearly if -- if petitioner had -- had taken an appeal, there would've been a bill of exceptions, there would have been a contemporaneous record of what the trial was -- of what the evidence at the trial was.</text>
            <text syncTime="5420.157" offset="21784012">He complained of no -- of no procedural unfairness here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5423.952" offset="21799163">There was no -- there is no suggestion of a violation of -- of any of the procedural rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5430.433" offset="21825076">He complains in essence, I suppose, of an instruction which the judge may have engaged to the jury saying that they could find guilt under -- under both counts the evidence established only -- only one shot but -- but that would be a clear case of using collateral attack under 2255 for the purposes of an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="5452.862" offset="21914833">We think that -- that 2255 is not so intended that you cannot use 2255, the collateral attack with a history which that section had for purposes of resolving disputed fact issues at a trial, indeed, for purposes of attempting to establish what the evidence at that trial was.</text>
            <text syncTime="5477.143" offset="22011904">This, relying on -- on cases such as Sunal against Large which is cited in our brief, we submit that -- that you cannot by 2255, have a hearing to determine what the evidence which was introduced at the trial -- at the trial was.</text>
