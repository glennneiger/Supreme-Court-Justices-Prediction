            <label>Mr. Dominick L. Manoli</label>
            <text syncTime="23.700" offset="94772">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.593" offset="106371">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.277" offset="129045">It presents two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.392" offset="141479">The first of these is whether under the National Labor Relations Act, an employer may insist as a condition of a collective-bargaining agreement that the bargaining representative agree not to call a strike over any dispute which the parties aren't able to settle through negotiations including the termination or modification of the collective-bargaining agreement until all of the employees in the bargaining unit have had an opportunity to vote on whether to accept or reject the company's last offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.821" offset="291213">The second question presented in this case is whether under the Act, an employer may insist that the collective-bargaining agreement be between the company, the employer, the employer and the Local and the International rather than the International which the Board has certified as the employees' bargaining representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.633" offset="386508">In other words, the question here is whether a bargaining representative under our statute is required to bargain about proposals of this character.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.556" offset="426214">For convenience, I would like to refer these -- to these two proposals as the ballot clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.746" offset="446903">This is so-called strike vote clause and the other one as the recognition clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.059" offset="480235">Briefly, the Board held that the employer's insistence upon these two clauses, as a condition of the collective-bargaining agreement, violated the bargaining requirements of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.874" offset="527464">The court below, on the other hand, while agreeing with the Board with respect to the recognition clause that the employer's insistence upon having this contract solely with the Local rather than the International which you can certify, did violate the bargaining requirements of the statute, disagreed with the Board with respect to the ballot clause and held that it was permissible for the employer to insist upon the ballot clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.693" offset="618684">The facts which give rise to these two questions that are before us are not in dispute and I shall summarize them quite briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.017" offset="660062">In 1952, following the election among the company's employees, the Board certified as their bargaining representative the International Union United Automobile Workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.380" offset="709486">Shortly after the International was certified, it chartered a local which admitted to membership employees of a company at this particular plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.119" offset="756402">Shortly after the Local had been charted and the representatives of the International, the Local, and the company, beginning in 1953, entered into negotiations for the purpose of consummating a collective-bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.558" offset="814184">These negotiations continued for a period of several months and finally culminated in an unsuccessful strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.116" offset="840411">At the end of the unsuccessful strike the Local -- the Local but not the International, the Local accepted the company's terms including the two clauses that I've mentioned and the men, of course, returned to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.544" offset="894119">Now, going back to the negotiations and what took place there at the beginning of the negotiations, the International proposed a contract which would be between the company, on the one hand, and the International and it's Local as co-parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.878" offset="959425">The International also proposed to the company a “no-strike” clause with respect to matters which would be the subject matter of arbitration under its proposed contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.503" offset="1005923">The company, on the other hand, proposed a contract which named only the Local of the International as the party to the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.726" offset="1038838">More specifically, the company's proposal, which designating the union as the party to the contract designated as “Local 1238 affiliated with International Union, United Automobile Workers”.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.496" offset="1117936">The company also proposed that in case of a dispute between the parties which they were unable to resolve through negotiation that the union would not call a strike until the company's last offer had been submitted to the -- to the employees for them to vote as whether to accept or reject the company's last offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.726" offset="1206857">In the event that the majority of the employees rejected the company's offer, then the company was to have a -- an opportunity of submitting a further proposal within 72 hours and the employees were again to be given an opportunity, all of the employees in the unit, both non -- both members of the union as well as nonmembers.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.235" offset="1288882">All of them will have a further opportunity to vote on whether to accept or reject the company's proposals.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.778" offset="1323050">The company explained these two proposals in this fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.257" offset="1344993">It -- it explained this -- the so-called recognition clause that the contract should be with the Local rather than certified International on the ground that the Local was more familiar with the local plant conditions and that therefore it should have the right to have its own contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.074" offset="1412284">It explained the strike ballot clause on two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.529" offset="1430047">First of all, that it would enable it to have a better understanding of what the employees wanted and that it would permit the company to reexamine if necessary its position in the light of their wishes.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.839" offset="1479262">And secondly, that it was designed to prevent -- I think to where they put was a -- a well disciplined minority from stacking union meetings and calling unwanted strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.905" offset="1535582">The -- in the negotiations which follow, I might say the union rejected both proposals.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.182" offset="1572676">In the negotiations which followed, the company continued to insist upon these two clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.074" offset="1596291">It made a slight modification in the so-called recognition clause and to change the recognition clause so that -- that the union would be designated as Local 1238 of International Union, United Automobile Workers instead of Local 1238 affiliated with.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.052" offset="1668180">But the change, nevertheless, continued to reflect the company's stated purpose that the contract should be with the Local rather than the International which the Board had certified.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.041" offset="1712065">The company also modified somewhat it's -- the ballot clause so that to -- in -- so that, and perhaps I omitted this, that the original ballot proposal as proposed by the company further provided that the contract was not to be terminated until after the employees are also -- have a vote -- to vote upon that matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.156" offset="1816555">In its final revision of this proposal the company included the question of -- of amendment and or modification of the contract as well as its termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.495" offset="1853962">In other words, before the contract could be -- if there dispute as to the terminating or modifying the contract the company's final proposal or it would have to be submitted to the employees for a vote as to whether they accept or reject.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.980" offset="1911850">The -- throughout the negotiations the company made it clear that agreement was contingent upon the union's acceptance of these clauses, these so-called ballot and recognition clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.243" offset="1980918">The union for it part resisted these two proposals, informed the company that agreement would not be possible as long as this company insisted on either one of them, inferred that the employees were prepared to strike over either one of these proposals.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.596" offset="2042358">The company and the union were also -- and lowered their heads on other matters and as a consequence a strike was called and the strike, as I've indicated, was unsuccessful and at the conclusion for the strike the Local, but not the International, accepted the company's terms including the so-called ballot and recognition clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.713" offset="2122815">The International did not -- was not a party to the final agreement which was signed between the company and the Local.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.551" offset="2154162">Now, as I've indicated, briefly, few minutes ago, the board held that the company's insistence upon these two clauses as a condition of the collective-bargaining agreement violated the bargaining requirements of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.566" offset="2210168">More specifically, the Board held that these two clauses affect the bargaining representative's status as the exclusive representative of all the employees that this status does relate to terms or conditions of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.750" offset="2274952">And that, therefore, the union was not required to bargain with respect to these -- to these matters and that the company by insisting upon bargaining, by insisting upon these two clauses as a condition of the collective-bargaining agreement, in effect, was refusing to accord to the union the full and exclusive recognition which -- to which it is entitled to, to which it is entitled under the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="599.865" offset="2399399">The court below, to explain it a little more fully its position, as I've said before, accepted part of the Board's case but rejected the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.219" offset="2440777">They accepted the Board's position that insofar as the company here was insistent of this contract to be with the Local rather than the International which I say the Board had certified, that the company had engaged in unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.570" offset="2498247">And courts agreed with us, that the union status as the exclusive bargaining representative entitled it to be a party to the contract and that the company's insistence upon excluding it from the contract from being a party to the contract, in effect, was tantamount to a failure to give it --</text>

            <text syncTime="917.946" offset="3671771">We are here complaining about the court's ruling with respect to the ballot clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.843" offset="3695282">But we -- the other side is complaining with respect to the court's ruling as to the recognition clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.336" offset="3717329">We won, in other words, on the recognition clause and laws under ballot clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.869" offset="3735406">I suppose analysis of the two questions which confront us here begins with a brief restatement of the collective bargaining principle which the statute has defined and is further explicated by the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.259" offset="3817012">The statute provides that the exclusive bargaining representative -- that the bargaining representative, designator selected by a majority of the employees in a particular bargaining unit shall be the exclusive representative of all the employees in the unit for purposes of collective bargaining with respect to rates and hours of pay and other terms and conditions of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.890" offset="3911471">The -- the central concept of the statute in this respect, is, that the bargaining representative speaks for all of the employees in the unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.854" offset="3971344">And that provided that it deals fairly with the interest of all of them that it has the authority to enter into binding and final commitments on their behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.926" offset="4011677">The authority of the bargaining representative to speak for and bind all of the employees in the unit may perhaps, without pushing the analogy too far, may be compared to the powers which are vested in a legislative body.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.079" offset="4064235">For as this Court had said, Congress has seen fit to uphold the bargaining representative with powers comparable to a legislative body both to create and restrict the rights of those whom it represents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.289" offset="4121078">It is for the bargaining representative, under this scheme -- under this scheme, which Congress has set forth in this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.454" offset="4145737">It is for the bargaining representative to formulate demands, to accept or reject what the company -- what the employer proposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.422" offset="4181682">In a word control of the employee side of the bargaining table is lodged in the bargaining representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.869" offset="4215432">By the same token, the employer is under a duty, as decisions of this Court have made quite plain, he's under a duty to accord to the bargaining representative full and exclusive recognition to recognize the bargaining representative has full and exclusive control of the employee side of the bargaining table and finally that the employer may not deal directly with the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.501" offset="4317936">Now, how does the recognition clause or rather, how does the ballot clause fit into this statutory scheme?</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.011" offset="4359941">The ballot clause in affect provides for a referendum by the employees to register their approval or disapproval of their representative decision at the bargaining table and to register their approval or disapproval with the respect to determination or the modification of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.979" offset="4447817">Now, we believe that the company's insistence upon a clause of this character, upon a referendum of this kind, involves a diminution of the bargaining representative part, exclusive part to deal with the employer on matters of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.982" offset="4523886">And further that it represents an intrusion into the internal affairs of the bargaining representative and that the employer may not insist upon bargaining about these matters and that union is not compelled to bargaining about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.663" offset="4582609">Now, in the first place, we think that a clause of this kind, that a ballot proposal of this kind permits the employer in a very real, in a very practical sense, to deal directly with the employees himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.241" offset="4640914">By the same token it permits the employees to deal with the employer directly rather than as the statute contemplates and requires through their bargaining representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.457" offset="4685740">The very proposal itself, I think, indicates that the employer is -- is seeking to bargain with the employees directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.879" offset="4715416">He would make one offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.590" offset="4722312">If that offer was rejected then he would make a further offer for the employees to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.970" offset="4747807">And the fact that this kind of a ballot device enables the employer to deal directly with the employees on matters of collective bargaining, is, I think, emphasized by the company's own explanation as to what this clause was intended to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="2230.946" offset="8923742">In essence what we're -- what I'm trying to say is that we think that the company's insistence upon these -- this clause, the recognition clause in effect was tantamount that towards an insistence that the bargaining representative weigh, weigh the powers which it has under this statute, namely, it's the exclusive control over the employee side of the bargaining table.</text>

            <text syncTime="2273.390" offset="9093538">Then we think that this is not a matter as to which the company can insist that the union bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.050" offset="9128124">The statute defines as an area -- as the area of compulsory bargaining or let me put at this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.240" offset="9156859">The area which the statute defines is the subject to compulsory bargaining relates to hours, rates of pay and other terms and conditions of employment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2309.491" offset="9237943">That, I think, is the teaching of this -- of this Court's decision in the American National.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.329" offset="9257273">And while I'm in American National, I do want to say if he words here on that -- about that case because it's quite so important a part in the adverse decisions that we've had on this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.892" offset="9295517">Now, of course, it plays a very important role in the company's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.770" offset="9310981">We think that American National is distinguishable from this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.922" offset="9327595">In the American National, the Court will recall the employer was insistent that the contract included a so called management -- management functions prerogative or something, something of that sort whereby -- whereby the employer alone would handle matters relating to discipline, production -- scheduled productions and promotions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.464" offset="9445773">The union, on the other hand, insisted it would -- whenever there was a dispute as to these matters, it should be submitted to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.072" offset="9476284">Now, this Court -- the majority of this Court held that the employer as long as he was acting in good faith could insist upon those -- upon its proposal with respect to the handling of these matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.077" offset="9528216">As this Court solved the case, there's the majority this Court solved the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.863" offset="9543367">These basic items as to which there was a dispute namely, the scheduling of production, promotions, disciplinary matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.106" offset="9572415">They related to terms and conditions of employment and that therefore the employer as long as he was acting in good faith could insist upon those demands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.072" offset="9612225">Here, however, though, we do not have a matter that relates to terms and conditions of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.784" offset="9643050">What we do have is a matter that relates to the union's status as the exclusive bargaining representative of the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.505" offset="9681920">The union achieves this status as a matter of right once it has won an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.535" offset="9702087">And the -- it's -- it's status -- it is not a negotiable item under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.642" offset="9722567">The employer doesn't have the option of saying, I will bargain with you as to whether I will give you the full and exclusive recognition which the statute says you're entitled to as to matter of right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.799" offset="9763109">If that were so, it would mean that the union, the bargaining representative would have to defend at the bargaining table what's its victory could pose and the statute has assured that it is a matter of right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.551" offset="9830191">Let me turn now to the arguments on the other side on this proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.603" offset="9850358">The company argues first, that there's really no question of recognition involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.494" offset="9881913">And their argument, therefore, falls.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.994" offset="9891944">That what they have here is something in the nature of a qualified “no-strike” clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.452" offset="9913783">And that since a “no-strike” clause is a subject matter of collective bargaining, there's no phases upon which to distinguish since that situation and this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.572" offset="9966237">There is a surface -- a certain amount surface plausibility of this argument, indeed enough I guess to have appealed through two courts, the Seventh and the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals because they've adopted this -- this approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.660" offset="10034573">Despite the surface appeal, if I may say so, we think that the argument overlooks decisive differences between the “no-strike” clause and the clause which we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.953" offset="10083788">The employees entrust to their bargaining representative the exercise of their right to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.827" offset="10111269">They authorize the bargaining representative to either retain that -- that right or to wait as a quid pro quo for concessions on the part of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.612" offset="10154423">A concession of this kind by the union, by the representative involves no diminution you might say of its status.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.671" offset="10186606">But here though, on our analysis that any rate, upon our analysis, the ballot clause in effect calls upon the union to surrender the very power of decision which the statute confers upon it with respect to collective-bargaining matters.</text>

            <text syncTime="2624.818" offset="10499239">The further argument which the company has made, and I've already touched upon it briefly, in answer to Mr. Justice Brennan's question and that is that there is a internal inconsistency in the Board's position, namely, the Board recognizes that it's lawful for the employer to make a proposal of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.246" offset="10592967">That it's lawful for the bargaining represented to accept it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.827" offset="10611252">But the company says despite this recognition by the Board as to the lawfulness of the proposal and lawfulness of acceptance, nevertheless, the Board goes on to say that the employer can't insist upon this kind of a proposal as a condition of the collective-bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.945" offset="10683768">Well, Your Honor as I said a moment ago, a union may not like capacity to waive some right that it has under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.995" offset="10711980">But I submit that the option is -- the option that the -- that waiver is the option of a bargaining representative and not of that of the employer because if the employer could do this, it would mean -- it would mean that in -- in essence that the employer has the option of bargaining as to whether or not he will give the bargaining representative the kind of recognition that is entitled to under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.094" offset="10820336">Let me go on now to the second question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.065" offset="10856176">Let me go on now to the second question which is presented by this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.488" offset="10877910">And that is, whether the company could insist that the collective-bargaining agreement be with the Local, rather than the International which the Board has certified as the employer's exclusive representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.709" offset="10934753">As I have previously stated, the Board certified the International after an election among the company's employees and the International charted the Local after the International itself had been certified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.541" offset="10986162">The union proposed originally that the contract that they were the company on the one hand and the International and the Local as co-parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.602" offset="11022315">The company on the other hand, insisted that the contract be with the Local, rather than the International.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.863" offset="11055438">The company seeks to defend its proposal in this respect that on the ground that the clause which it proposed, the so-called recognition clause, that it proposed was a mere identification clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.151" offset="11108519">If that is all it was, it seems rather odd, that it should have proved to be such a stumbling block in these negotiations.</text>

            <text syncTime="3089.858" offset="12359367">At pages 43 to 45 of the brief, we have made reference to contract clauses in the B and A of that sort of thing and as some of the Court well know there are some unions that do it one way and some another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.914" offset="12419553">The steel workers insist no matter how certified if possible that their contracts be with the International's.</text>

            <text syncTime="3211.989" offset="12847856">Now, there is no question but what we are obligated to bargain with the union and the statutory definition of bargaining means that we must meet and confer with the union in good faith as the exclusive representative of our employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.038" offset="12920059">The statute says not one word about the name in which the union may identify itself in the contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="3243.911" offset="12975543">I do believe that the name in which the union may or may not or shall or shall not identify itself in the contract is a term or condition of the employment and is therefore bargainable and I will undertake to demonstrate that later, if that answered your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.888" offset="13039491">Now, there's one other question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.080" offset="13064255">Mr. Justice Frankfurter you suggested to Mr. Manoli and inquired as to what he would think if in the course of the bargaining the company were to insist that the union refer back to the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.211" offset="13120784">The question is to whether or not they had authority and what they should do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.648" offset="13134576">I agree with Mr. Manoli that that would be an unfair labor practice for the company to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.049" offset="13164147">And that has been decided I think -- I think that's the effect of the Corsicana Cotton Mills case below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.939" offset="13187657">I think that's far different, than was the case here where the company asked the union not to refer back to anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.692" offset="13214720">The company fully recognized the union's representative capacity and said only to the union, “We ask that you agree to so and so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.597" offset="13246380">We don't ask that you to go back to anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.717" offset="13254844">We don't ask that you produce any further authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.975" offset="13263830">We ask you across this bargaining table to agree to these things because we think there are terms and conditions of employment and we think we are entitled to have agreement to that.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.969" offset="13295804">So that I would concede that if we asked them to go back to refurbish their authority everyday, that would be clearly an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.609" offset="13330390">But when we recognize their authority without question, but ask them to exercise that authority in a proper way, we believe that we were bargaining within the terms of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3373.306" offset="13493185">Then after we are in agreement with him or I think we have a right to ask them to agree, to a provision that will say, “Not that they not submit to people issues or what they should do on them but that before they exercise the right to strike.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.320" offset="13553267">That's all we ask them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.510" offset="13557969">Now, Mr. Manoli stated this quite accurately in his oral argument here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.093" offset="13576359">It's stated a little inaccurately in the Board's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.411" offset="13589629">But as he correctly said to the Court, that provision simply says, “Mr. union, we ask you here and now across the bargaining table to agree, not that you will submit for advisory opinions to your constituents, what you will do or will not do about any given issue, or what position you will take in grievances or what position you were to take on anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.874" offset="13683461">Solely, do we ask that before you call a strike, we ask that you agree to submit the question to a vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.918" offset="13723585">You're perfectly free to call a strike afterward.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.663" offset="13738632">Now, we -- we contend, Your Honor, that that kind of a provision advanced in good faith, is not a valid clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.387" offset="13773531">We -- we're getting as bad as governmental agencies in their identification lingo here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.100" offset="13792340">We call that a limited “no-strike” clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.654" offset="13802580">And I think those, too, indicate the -- the thrust of our -- of our reasoning.</text>

            <text syncTime="3537.916" offset="14151576">Now, that carries to Mr. Justice Brennan's distinction earlier between permissible and compulsory subjects of bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.538" offset="14190132">And as I will attempt to demonstrate, there lies again the -- the root of this case, because I think there are few if any bargainers.</text>

            <text syncTime="3681.077" offset="14724284">They have the situation, where admittedly, these proposals the Board has always maintained and Mr. Manoli still states to this Court, both of these proposals, were legal to make, legal to include in the contract, legal for the union to accept.</text>
            <text syncTime="3699.658" offset="14798576">But that at some stage in the game, the proposal so legal to make and legal to accept became illegal, because of insistence.</text>

            <text syncTime="3730.930" offset="14923651">It is argued here that -- that this company with a small plant in Western Ohio in its first contract compelled the United Auto Workers to agree to something that they didn't want to agree to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3745.774" offset="14983001">That is an interesting concept to me, too.</text>

            <text syncTime="3765.765" offset="15063040">The truth of the matter is that this union and this company have had a long history of bargaining at the Pesco Division of Borg-Warner, another division making the same product in Cleveland Ohio, in a heart of an industrial area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3788.057" offset="15152170">The same bargainers Mr. Adams who represented the company here, Mr. (Inaudible) who represented the union here, had been bargaining with each other for years, at Pesco and they bargained in and out of strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3811.109" offset="15244434">The record here is that when this division was opened, the UAW came down avowedly to get the Pesco rates of pay.</text>

            <text syncTime="3821.535" offset="15286126">There isn't any question about that but it admittedly was in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="3827.660" offset="15310576">Now at Pesco, two years before, I think it was, the certification, at Pesco is Local Union No. 269 of the International Auto Workers and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3849.188" offset="15396676">They bargained right up to a strike at Pesco as to whether the union would be identified in the contract by the local name as the company attempted to insist, or and as it was certified, or as the union insisted, and successfully insisted in that negotiation, to identify the union, the bargaining representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3882.420" offset="15529587">Now, there's only one bargaining representative in all of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3887.640" offset="15550485">And the bargaining representative at Pesco, the union insisted be identified as the International but the Local is the only one certified.</text>

            <text syncTime="4016.626" offset="16066456">Now, in that background with the same bargainers, the same protagonists arose the issue in this bargaining as to how the union would be identified.</text>
            <text syncTime="4037.772" offset="16150988">The Board says, in its opinion in this case, that, of course, we were free to reject any recognition clause, naming the union by anything other than the certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="4056.132" offset="16224444">And I say that is “life in a never, never land” so far as bargaining is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="4063.213" offset="16252761">We weren't any freer to reject it here than we were to reject at Pesco.</text>
            <text syncTime="4071.287" offset="16285048">The first proposal that was served upon the company at Wooster was identified as proposal of Local 1269, I think it was, of the United Auto Workers.</text>

            <text syncTime="4128.341" offset="16513358">Now, of course, in the light of the campaign that has been conducted, it was a fact of life that the union had to tag the Local into the name, and I -- I understand that.</text>

            <text syncTime="4903.400" offset="19613571">No man can be a member of this union without being a member of the Local.</text>
            <text syncTime="4907.209" offset="19628826">The constitution so provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="4909.414" offset="19637603">The constitution provides that the International officers as such have no authority even to negotiate a contract without the approval of the Local.</text>
            <text syncTime="4918.251" offset="19672921">Now, I agree, that those are all matters of internal administration, internal law of the union which the union would from time to time have a right to change wholly independent of the company and the company has no right to dictate that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4933.446" offset="19733734">But I say that it is a long established practice in industry, in this country to bargain with unions, as to the name in which they shall be identified in a contract and that the certificate has never been thought to be a bar to that and has never been thought to be derogated by that by either unions or companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4968.001" offset="19871974">We are not seeking here to contract with a separate organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="4974.042" offset="19896111">And it is a question in my opinion, Your Honor, of what is or is not a term or condition of employment and therefore, a matter of bargaining area and not a question of recognition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4992.166" offset="19968627">The statute never uses the word "recognition", never uses the word "representative status".</text>
            <text syncTime="4998.383" offset="19993496">Those are gloss and grafted on the statute by courts who have moved into this thing without -- without segregating recognition, bargaining area and good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="5010.427" offset="20041665">They're -- they're all blended together.</text>
            <text syncTime="5011.943" offset="20047726">Now, it's my position that the statutory requirement of recognition is very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="5019.458" offset="20077819">It is meet, that's the language of the statute, that -- it's defined in 8 (d), the -- the obligation of bargaining collectively is defined as the duty to meet and confer with the representative of the employees and then if you engraft on to that, the provision that you must do so as the exclusive representatives -- representative to the employees to discuss terms and conditions of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5046.463" offset="20185757">There is no dispute but what we met and conferred with Local representatives, International representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="5053.348" offset="20213342">They've got what they call a Borg-Warner counsel, with Borg-Warner counsel representatives.</text>
