            <text syncTime="9.713" offset="38766">Chief Justice, Members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.977" offset="119850">And this case comes before you arising originally in the State of Arizona in a capital case in which the defendant was found guilty of first degree murder and punishment was set to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.617" offset="190380">Subsequent to that time, the case was appealed to the State Supreme Court of the State of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.699" offset="222772">The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.945" offset="243775">The defendant subsequently, filed an extraordinary motion for new trial which was denied by the lower court, appealed to the State Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.929" offset="311693">The State Supreme Court affirmed the denial by the Superior Court which is our court of first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.018" offset="343980">And the petitioner herein then filed an application for writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court, which was not granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.916" offset="399569">The petitioner then filed an application for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court in Phoenix, Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.104" offset="444395">And he filed that in two forms, through his counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.367" offset="461427">And was counsel here, today.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.910" offset="475638">The writ was heard on by -- with argument and by examination of a -- of the transcript of the original trial, eight volumes which had been and more forward into this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.740" offset="558916">The applications for writs of habeas corpus or any one but they were in two forms, were denied by Judge McCollough.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.926" offset="607608">And from that denial, the petitioner obtained a certificate of probable cause from the judge of the District Court and appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, in which the -- it was a hearing and the District Court was affirmed and from the affirmation by the Ninth Circuit court of the District Court's of -- denial of writ of habeas corpus, counsel filed a petition for an application for a writ of certiorari and it -- it is that -- it was on that base that we have before you today.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.558" offset="786181">The -- the fundamental -- there are two aspects to the -- to the application by the petitioner in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.444" offset="849711">And I think the most fundamental one, of course, goes to the admission into evidence in the original trial of a confession of the defendant and the petitioner herein.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.239" offset="908852">The trial court had before it a number of confessions of the petitioner, Arthur Thomas.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.863" offset="975412">Most of them, written, transcribed by secretaries and read and then signed by the petitioner -- by the defendant, Arthur Thomas.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.401" offset="1033509">The Trial Court heard the -- these confessions in an ancillary procedure, that is a procedural side of the -- of the presence of the jury and predicated upon the original arrest and the method of the arrest of the defendant, held the confessions to be involuntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.343" offset="1133296">The circumstances of that arrest were in the nature of a putative lynching.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.163" offset="1160568">The testimony which was admitted by the State's witnesses, including the Sheriff, was that the defendant was found about 30 or 40 miles north of Bisbee, in a small community, a cotton area which had recently been put into cotton production and he was a cotton chopper there and this was his occupation.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.160" offset="1272581">He lived with a common-law wife in a -- in a housing provided by the owners or the managers of this -- of this cotton acreage.</text>

            <text syncTime="342.145" offset="1368503">Its -- during the war and just subsequent to the war, they started mining water in that area and pouring it on the ground and raising high grade cotton.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.790" offset="1419076">And this area was in -- being cleared at this time and being put into production for a long staple Egyptian cotton.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.715" offset="1454811">And the defendant in this case, the petitioner here was a itinerant worker.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.577" offset="1482292">He came from West Texas and was working in the fields, at this time, pulling out roots.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.367" offset="1509460">He was discovered, there's been a -- the homicide was discovered in the morning and the Sheriff went out and they searched and they found certain information which indicated that the party they were looking for was the petitioner in this case, Arthur Thomas.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.936" offset="1579677">And in the afternoon of the date of discovery of the homicide, they went out with a group of men anywhere from 10 to 11 to 12, maybe more, some on horseback, who collected together, local ranchers who knew the deceased who was a white woman, who ran a small market where her body was found.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.409" offset="1673613">And off in the desert, they discovered the defendant and the Sheriff came along and was discovered by one of the Sheriff's deputies and he was handcuffed and bought out, the other men gathered about and the Sheriff was there with a representative with the State highway patrol, the young man by the name of Harry (Inaudible) and a Sergeant (Inaudible) from the Arizona State highway department, I believe, was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.048" offset="1808091">And at this point, after the defendant who had not put up any resistance and was handcuffed while he was roped about the neck and there is a conflict then of testimony as to what occurred as it's shown by the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="534.652" offset="2138593">The Sheriff denied this under oath.</text>

            <text syncTime="576.824" offset="2307239">The defendant at that time indicated that a third party, a young boy by the name Ross Lee Cooper was a culpable party and that he was the culpable party.</text>

            <text syncTime="764.414" offset="3057580">But be that as it may, they -- were to the ground at least once with a rope around them and there were some dispute as to whether at each particular time the rope was around their necks or whether at one time, it was around part of their neck and part of their body or whether it was around their body.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.698" offset="3130723">These were all state witnesses as to -- as to -- and they contradicted themselves as to the position of the rope.</text>

            <text syncTime="818.840" offset="3275337">The -- when they got to Willcox, the Justice of Peace or the magistrate, and a committee of magistrate was unavailable by a reason that he was out doing his other job of collecting children for the -- as a school bus driver.</text>
