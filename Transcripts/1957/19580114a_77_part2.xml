            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">You may proceed Mr. Kintner.</text>

            <label>Mr. Earl W. Kintner</label>
            <text syncTime="7.832" offset="31242">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.778" offset="51096">In replying to questions of Mr. Justice Frankfurter, I think it might be relevant to point out concerning the pricing practices of the petitioner here.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.466" offset="121835">That the pricing practice complained of and which it alleges is common to the industry, was only superficially common to substantially -- substantial portions of the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.642" offset="186514">For instance, in its own three principal lines, the respondent has a different price, maximum price with respect to each of those lines, 0% to 19% in its coil line, 0% to 15% in its leaf spring line and 0% to 20% in its piston line.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.756" offset="338965">This Court in the -- I'm turning very briefly to cases which we think govern in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.130" offset="380447">This Court in the case of U.S. versus Wabash Railroad said -- had this to say, the suppression of abuses resulting from violations would be rendered practically impossible if the Commission referring to the I.C.C. were required to suppress all simultaneously or none.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.296" offset="469159">Section 12 (1), imposes on the Commission, the duty to enforce the provisions of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.638" offset="490475">That duty would hardly be performed if the Commission were to define -- decline to enforce it, against one because it could not at the same time enforce it against all.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.217" offset="544810">And many years later, Judge Medina graphically following that line of reasoning in a Clayton Act proceeding Section 3 case said that preliminarily, it's been noted, that potential or even probable adverse effects on petitioner's business alone is not sufficient basis for withholding injunctive relief, where we to hold otherwise, we would quite effectively draw the teeth of Section 3 and the antitrust laws generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.137" offset="676467">It appears self evident that any provision upon behavior which tightens competition will necessarily endure to the immediate economic disadvantage of the individual or business organization engaged in that behavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.876" offset="759432">Essentially, the problem raised here in this appeal is one that is common not only to the Federal Trade Commission's submission of law enforcement but is a common -- a problem common to all law enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.119" offset="844382">It was as ever been does that those charge to a violation of the -- of the law say to the administrator or the person engaged in enforcing the law, get my brothers who are equally guilty before you get me and bring me to book.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.734" offset="938841">It was us, when I was a state prosecuting attorney more than a decade ago and it is thus the day with the Federal Trade Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="246.707" offset="986802">I think at -- if I'm mistaken I thought of the opinion here, almost in every criminal -- is also enough from defense lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.382" offset="1033509">Why don't they bring in bigger picture that this Court (Inaudible) for you gentlemen at the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.327" offset="1073215">I think that's a very different thing to say, you shouldn't prosecute A, because he also keeps me from saying that in the domain of commercial regulation, where if it would be true, there's a big “if”.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.041" offset="1132147">If A, B and C are competitors, serious competitors and they're all engaged (Inaudible) conscious parallelism, if he can bring all the men and have a trade wise or a proportionately trade-wise order if that can be done certainly it would be a decent administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.801" offset="1223158">It would be fair to do that and I'm yet -- I'm still trying to see why as you put it before the recess that there aren't such situation such as the (Inaudible) club where you can -- where you can bring them all in.</text>

            <text syncTime="344.432" offset="1377698">Here, the practices are not precisely the same nor would the defenses available to the respondent's be the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.008" offset="1427958">Where it can and supportive as it is able, the Commission thus move against the principal factors in an industry and situations of this character as indeed it has in this instance.</text>

            <text syncTime="378.243" offset="1512908">The Commission, in each instance, must determine whether or not to proceed in that case at that time or to wait the investigation of other cases and to file several complaints at one time against an industry involving similar practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.927" offset="1591693">The -- it uses its administrative discretion, its law enforcement discretion, a discretion which from time immoral and our judgment has been used by law enforcement authorities whether they'd be district attorneys or administrative agents.</text>
