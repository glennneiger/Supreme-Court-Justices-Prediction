            <text syncTime="184.117" offset="736444">But the effect of this order was to reduce it by 19000 men to 6500 and I think it had been up to about 25000.</text>

            <text syncTime="275.826" offset="1103203">For example in St. Regis Paper Company case and it had a loss of $3 million because of an order prohibiting the consumption of pulp wood by any paper company in a certain geographical area.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.332" offset="1169241">And that prevented its plants from obtained pulp order and the Court of Claims held the order was a valid war time regulation under the statutory power to allocate materials and facilities and was not a taking of private property and you denied certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.329" offset="1237264">And then in Orofino case, the Court of Claims was dealing with this very order L-208 which shut down, had the effect of shutting down the Orofino Gold Mines.</text>

            <text syncTime="626.329" offset="2505247">Now it was reported to the War Production Board in September, that the loss of another 5,000 or 6,000 workers in the copper mines might so prejudice fabricating processes that 100,000 workers in war plants would be affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.706" offset="2570762">And in July 1942, the production of copper had dropped by 1,000 tones.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.968" offset="2599811">Now, this order was issued on October 6, 1942.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.001" offset="2623948">The memorandum to the War Production Board, of one of its bureaus, September 9, 1942 estimated that sizeable amounts of critical materials would be saved in closing the gold mines.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.402" offset="2681522">In one year they had spent $17 million on materials and supplies, $7 million for fuel and electricity.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.363" offset="2717362">Another memorandum, two days later develops that whole business of the conservation of materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.020" offset="2759993">A report for the minutes of the meeting at which this order with issued, and it had been under discussion for a month or more.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.527" offset="2802103">It was recommended by Under Secretary Rob Patterson, Under Secretary the Navy Forrestal.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.649" offset="2826553">Patterson said the situation was so alarming as to the shortage of miners and the production of copper, the army was about to call our soldiers to go back and work in the copper mines.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.169" offset="2872633">He said this is a hard step for the army to take, but the effect of this step and others will not give complete relief if nothing is done to transfer gold miners to copper mines.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.670" offset="2922580">Now the minutes of this meeting when the order was issued, refers exclusively to the necessity of closing the gold mines in order, in the hope and belief and expectation that its miners would go to the non-ferrous metal mines, where they were desperately needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.425" offset="3017665">I might say that the government had no power to draft men to work in mines or to make them work anywhere they didn't want to work.</text>

            <text syncTime="975.026" offset="3900082">It wasn't a taking under any decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.310" offset="3913143">It wasn't a taking as a matter of social justice and it wasn't a taking under, I think any modern philosophy of private property.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.551" offset="3954103">I might say this, that the Court also placed its opinion on highly technical grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.366" offset="3977404">They said this that L208 exceeded permissible regulation because no provision was included that machinery and equipment and material made idle would be held for the use of the government, and the L208 did not require that the owners deliver their material to essential users.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.426" offset="4073639">The Court of Claims reasoned then that L208 didn't go too far, that it didn't go far enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.430" offset="4113659">That if it had contained such a provision as they complain about, it would have been a valid regulation and yet they overlooked the fact that by amendments in November of 1942, this Act, the War Production Board had included the very provisions that they complained were in the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.596" offset="4214282">Now, why do we submit that this is a -- not a taking of private property for public use?</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.099" offset="4260362">For instance, we say you do not have the necessary elements of a constitutional taking for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.486" offset="4289933">There was no acquisition of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.439" offset="4301740">The United States didn't seize the gold mines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.775" offset="4315011">This isn't a Pewee Coal case or a Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1249.813" offset="4999210">Now we say there was no taking of properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.097" offset="5012376">As Justice Holmes said in Truax against Corrigan, “delusive exactness is a source of fallacy throughout the law by calling a business property you make it same like land, nothing on more deprecate than the use of the constitution to prevent the making of social experiments though few are even of obnoxious to me.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.577" offset="5098266">And Cardozo said, “Property like liberty has been taught that some of its most cherished immunities are not absolute, but relative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.382" offset="5133479">That the owner of land might find himself restricted in emergencies as a means to social justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.710" offset="5158766">Zoning laws we prohibit use, certain kinds of use which may add up to the value of the property almost and there is not even an emergency involved and it is done not temporarily in war time but on a permanent basis.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1372.296" offset="5489162">And their product gold was as immaterial to that war effort as if they had been producing snowballs or nothing at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="1986.015" offset="7944046">You'll find on page seven, a quotation from the Senate and House Reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.392" offset="7993469">It says, at the present time many other claimants, this is after referring to this decision of the Court of Claims in Idaho0Maryland, that on the pleadings the complainants there, had stated a case for just compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.284" offset="8061074">They say at the present time many other claimants who have a better right for an adjudication of their claims, as does the Idaho Maryland Mines Corporation, may not prosecute such claims due to the running of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.839" offset="8119275">Many other claimants after the ruling in Orofino undoubtedly felt that the file in the Court of Claims would be useless, and therefore allowed this statute to run against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.417" offset="8157623">So you see this bill, which passed was introduced after the Court of Claims had decided that on the pleadings there was a taking and titling the claimants to just compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.346" offset="8221362">So it wasn't necessary for -- so we say that Congress made it clear, it tried to open up this thing to everybody else, similarly affected.</text>

            <text syncTime="2077.190" offset="8308715">I just like to say this in conclusion here, if the -- this order had an impact that went far beyond the gold companies involved, it put communities out of business, property values in localities near the mines were destroyed, rental values were destroyed, shop keepers lost customers, business if not property and none of those people, none of those communities can recover for the consequential indirect damage which they sustained, and yet the respondents, the gold companies who were operating a business affected by the public interest claim they are entitled to compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.590" offset="8578299">So we're singling out this industry, operating a noxious business, now gold isn't noxious of course, but I say the production of gold or any other unnecessary immaterial commodity in war time when our national safety is involved, when it's consuming critical manpower and materials which we must have elsewhere, I say that, that definitely is noxious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.556" offset="8714136">It was detrimental to the public welfare.</text>

            <text syncTime="3098.499" offset="12393953">It was wise public policy to send our gold mining equipment and enable the government to continue, but what about Honduras?</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.200" offset="12428748">How can the government say that we should have said gold mining to Honduras, and the gold mining equipment, gold mining equipment to Honduras and then it's noxious?</text>

            <text syncTime="3126.221" offset="12504816">The situation so far as not essentiality and discrimination was precisely the same as in innumerable other industries using skilled workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.477" offset="12561868">We had a system of selective service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.970" offset="12579840">We had a system with priorities allocations and we had no system for the labor draft.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.602" offset="12610351">And this L208 was a kind of a special labor draft of its own, applied to one group of companies and individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.490" offset="12673881">And being a special one and being as they say the Court of Claims found; unwise and ill conceived, it proved to be a tragic failure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.598" offset="12738351">And that's why the Congress said what it said, not only because thing was unwise in the first place, but because it proved to be a failure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.377" offset="12773460">Not because as Mr. Doub generously admitted of any failure on the part of the gold mining companies to cooperate, they cooperated to the fullest degree.</text>

            <text syncTime="4208.588" offset="16834351">I consider it a very, very important point, but whether it's important or not, it shows the existence of an issue, of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4217.357" offset="16869355">We say that there was only one purpose, this order, and that was as the Chairman of the WPB said to maneuver hard rock miners, that was the only purpose and the Court of Claims so found.</text>
            <text syncTime="4239.483" offset="16957858">Now that finding was vigorously litigated before the commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="4245.079" offset="16980219">The commissioner said there was another purpose, secondary but still a purpose, and that was to conserve critical materials and we objected to that and that was knocked out by the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="4260.685" offset="17042704">Now what has happened, in their petition for certiorari, they said there were two purposes, one to conserve critical materials and two, to maneuver hard rock miners.</text>
            <text syncTime="4281.310" offset="17125146">Well they were not apparently satisfied with that statement in the petition for certiorari, so along they came in the brief and they changed the question presented, and they now say there were four purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4293.340" offset="17173316">One, it mentioned more or less -- well I don't that the mining purpose, second to get labor to go into other essential industries, that is to get the surplus employees of the gold mines to go work somewhere else; three to serve critical materials and four to divert mining machinery and equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4321.551" offset="17286165">Now by spreading out their petition for certiorari, they have I think fundamentally equated changed the case that is presented in this Court, but whether that, I am right about that or not, they have legitimatized so to speak the most expansive factual treatment that you can possibly imagine and in the process of the expanded factual treatment, they have it seems to me at least taken the greatest liberties with the documentary record, and I repeat, they do not mention findings as findings, they don't say which findings they agree with and which findings they don't agree with and to look to us this case is predominantly factual.</text>

            <text syncTime="4607.292" offset="18429074">The Atwater case in the Court of Claims was an interesting case, in that there, there was no rendition so called.</text>
            <text syncTime="4614.825" offset="18459272">There the government was -- had a firing range on Fire Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="4621.461" offset="18485812">And as a matter of safety, they told owners of property not to use their property within the orbit of the guns that were being shot, and the Court of Claims held that, that was a taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="4638.300" offset="18553104">Now supposing if that army commander had, had two powers, one was the power to take property and the other was the power to exclude owners of property from their property on the ground that there was a threat to the health of the soldiers and supposing that army commander issues an order and said because of the danger of Asiatic Flu, everybody within the range of 15 miles, which happens to be the range of the longest gun at the time, must get off their property and supposing it were established beyond the slightest question that the purpose of the order was to have a safety dome so they could shoot guns and that there was no danger whatever of the Asiatic Flu.</text>
            <text syncTime="4691.046" offset="18764173">Can the executive, and this is the question, that there being a constitutional question here, this is it, can the executive take property and escape liability by dressing up the taking as a regulation?</text>

            <text syncTime="4772.630" offset="19090495">But to say that you cannot -- that you can escape liability for a taking by dressing it up as a regulation, I can't believe that this Court will find that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4801.655" offset="19206583">Now, it's in point one of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4803.764" offset="19215047">We deal with certain things that are not what you might call technical aspects of the case but more have to do with the patriotic appeal that Mr. Doub has made and I like to run through them very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="4826.589" offset="19306266">They make as much as they can of the fact that the men who had to do with this order, particularly the President of the United States, were so purposely dedicated to winning the war.</text>
            <text syncTime="4838.290" offset="19353078">We don't dispute that, but in Ex Parte Milligan Justice David Davis who had been Lincoln's -- the administer of Lincoln's estate wrote to this Court when he said, “The Constitution of the United States is a law for rulers and the people, equally in war and in peace and covers with the shield of its protection all classes of men at all times and under all circumstances.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4865.601" offset="19462374">We reject the suggestion that we are unpatriotic because we are only asking to be put in the position we would have been in if a discriminatory order involving a taking had not been issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="4881.933" offset="19527680">We insist that the order was unique.</text>
            <text syncTime="4884.824" offset="19539278">That's gone into very fully with particular reference to these orders relating to passage of order of appeals (Inaudible) and what not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4896.226" offset="19584836">They seek to terrify the court by speaking of the vast amounts potentially involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4905.475" offset="19621825">The amounts potentially involved are 50 suits estimated by them in their brief, they have potential liabilities of $40 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="4915.219" offset="19660800">It's a pure figment of imagination that there can be any other claims, and there is no reason in the world to suppose that this kind of a procedure is ever going to be followed again.</text>
            <text syncTime="4930.733" offset="19722867">It is sui generis it seem to us where you have no regulatory system with respect to labor to issue an order closing down a business so it will throw the labor on the market and maybe get them to go elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="4949.645" offset="19798518">May I digress a minute on that and say, I said before and I don't want to get too far on the matter of the failure of the order, but there was a most incredible confusion, statistical confusion until the last minute, when the facts came out they didn't weigh it all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4975.920" offset="19903634">And the hope apparently was that the miners from the Homestake mines which is the biggest, by far the biggest of all the mines could be maneuvered as Mr. Nelson said to Climax in Colorado and to Butte Montana.</text>
            <text syncTime="4995.815" offset="19983256">The Court of Claims specifically found that the conditions at the mines were bad and the wages -- working and living conditions were bad as compared to what they were in the gold mines.</text>
            <text syncTime="5012.306" offset="20049189">In the case of, in the case of Climax the mine was over a 11,000 feet up in the Rocky Mountains and there are certainly many in this room who know that middle aged men and many of these miners were middle aged men can't be transplanted or maneuvered to take up arduous physical labor at 11,000 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="5043.969" offset="20175830">Now what happened?</text>
            <text syncTime="5046.688" offset="20186697">The Climax Molybdenum Company had a 125 workers from the gold mines referred to them and at present according to Mr. Colder of that company have only 10 of these workers on their payroll.</text>
            <text syncTime="5057.192" offset="20228702">This is report of April 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="5060.468" offset="20241868">They had 60 workers from the gold mines come to their mine, 6 of them failed to pass the physical examination and 44 of them had since quit working for this company.</text>
            <text syncTime="5072.600" offset="20290351">That is to say 60 came there, six failed to pass a physical -- that brought the number down to 54, you have special physicals for (Inaudible) to the operations, 44 quit and you got down to 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="5110.791" offset="20443115">I think the, I think the thing I want to emphasize more, most of all is the fact that these general observations about war losses do not apply to this particular very special episode.</text>
            <text syncTime="5135.982" offset="20543843">Now I, the government relies on the Caltex case I feel that there are two that -- the statement in the dissenting opinion in the Caltex case which is extremely pertinent and consistent with what this Court has held generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="5154.474" offset="20617822">Mr. Justice Douglas wrote with the concurrence of Mr. Justice Black it seems to me that the guiding principle should be this, whenever the government determines that one person's property whatever it maybe is essential to the war effort and appropriates for the common good, the public first rather the individual should bear the loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="5173.514" offset="20693995">Now I want to emphasize that whereas we do not yield to anyone in our appreciation of the gravity of the situation that existed during 1942, nevertheless what was done here was done as a result of the suggestion that was made in July 1942.</text>
            <text syncTime="5204.812" offset="20819174">There wasn't anything remotely approaching the situation that existed in Caltex.</text>
            <text syncTime="5212.507" offset="20849998">There wasn't anything remotely approaching the situation that existed on the West Coast next to the Japanese.</text>
            <text syncTime="5220.204" offset="20880718">There was plenty of time to find the facts, plenty of time to decide, to respect the law, there was plenty of time to wait and either have a statute for the general regulation of labor or to let the gold mine continue and deal with the problem of labor as it was dealt with in other areas.</text>

            <text syncTime="6395.643" offset="25582550">You'll find that they discussed substantial increases in the production of copper, zinc and lead $1.5 million in equipment transferred from the gold mines to essential non-ferrous metal mines, $15 million worth of strategic material was released from the gold mines that were closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6420.331" offset="25681293">The order resulted in the transfer of approximately 2000 gold miners to war industries and at least 1200 of these went into the copper mines and other essential non-ferrous metal mines.</text>

            <text syncTime="6445.221" offset="25780872">So in conclusion I would merely like to say this, there were good reasons for the high policy decision that gold should go on in South Africa and Canada and Honduras because those countries were absolutely dependent for their economy on it and I respectfully submit that this contention accepted by the Court of Claims is a very reactionary one and it (Inaudible) private property far beyond anything that's been held in any decision of this Court.</text>
