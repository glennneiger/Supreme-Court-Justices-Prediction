            <text syncTime="22.203" offset="88712">May it please the Court?</text>
            <text syncTime="25.696" offset="102713">This case rises under the Alaska Workmen's Compensation statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.377" offset="121417">In September 1951, the petitioner Carl Jenkins while in the course of his employment with Chugach Electric Association got a 1200 volt arc into his arm on the high power line, and it exploded out both his feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.918" offset="195605">Within one month following this accident, three amputations had been performed because of the electrical burning.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.482" offset="225907">The left arm had been amputated near the shoulder, the right leg below the knee, and four toes of the left foot.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.640" offset="262478">Within one year after the accident, the medical reports in the record show that Jenkins had been fitted with artificial limbs.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.799" offset="299154">He had an artificial left arm and artificial right leg and had it not been for the injury to the left foot where four toes were amputated.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.858" offset="339383">He could have sought and probably obtain some type of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.730" offset="358818">But, the left foot failed to heal and this failure continued on for a period of over three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.909" offset="391628">At the conclusion of the case before the Industrial Board and when this case went to the District Court, the evidence showed even then in December 1953 that the foot had not healed.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.958" offset="443768">If the case were remanded to the Board, I suspect that a finding could be made now that healing process was completed in 1954, early part of 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.789" offset="491102">Now, right after his injury, the insurance carrier commenced paying Jenkins what they called temporary compensation specifically provided under the Alaska statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.828" offset="539272">That statute provides that for all injuries causing temporary disability, the injured employee shall be paid 65% of his daily average wages during the period of the disability, and that has always been construed by the Industrial Board and by Alaska Courts as meaning that he gets, during the healing period until his wages, I mean until his injuries have stabilized or have been healed, 65% of his average wages whatever the board finds him to be, and in the average case at the end of that healing period, if there's any permanent injury, the Industrial Board makes a finding of what percentage permanent injuries involved and also gives employee an additional award under the permanent injury schedule of the Alaska Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="796.899" offset="3187566">I wanted to emphasize the provisions of the temporary compensation provision which is somewhat unique and not like the state statutes on this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.200" offset="3228735">I think most states have your partial permanent and total permanent awards which go over a number of weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.592" offset="3254335">Here you get a lump sum provision for permanent injury whether it's partial or total and I suppose the legislature had in mind that to -- that in the average case a man who has -- loses an arm or a leg has some adverse effect on his future earning power and perhaps this was the only way they could compensate him in some measure for what may be an adverse effect, whether it is or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.683" offset="3358720">Whereas the other section which is entirely separate says for all injuries throughout the temporary disability, not just those injuries which are without a loss of two limbs.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.698" offset="3418697">They should be paid daily average wages and then the second sentence of that provision I think requires some emphasis and attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.226" offset="3452865">It says in all cases where the injury develops or proves to be set as to entitle the workman to some compensation under any other provision of this schedule; then the two awards shall be paid at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.908" offset="3515559">In other words the Court of Appeals admitted that other cases are cases of permanent injury, and so if a man loses his arm Your Honors, and is paid temporary compensation during the healing period, he can also receive the permanent award for the loss of an arm.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.128" offset="3592464">Of course the Court of Appeal stops when you get two limbs gone and say that after the second amputation and in fact or after the classification when they make up their mind that he's permanently and totally disabled, even though he's not healed, even though it might be two years before he can go back to work and earn wages, he can't receive any more temporary compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.692" offset="3674697">And I respectfully submit that that is contrary to the clear express language of the Alaska legislature in temporary provision statute.</text>
