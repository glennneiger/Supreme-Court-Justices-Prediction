            <label>Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal</label>
            <text syncTime="11.827" offset="47229">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.919" offset="55589">In this case, which is here on certiorari to the First Circuit, this Court is called upon to determine the effect of Section 322 of the Transportation Act of 1940 upon the traditional obligation of common carriers to establish the validity of their claims against the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.192" offset="128731">Section 322, the terms of which are set forth at page 3 of the brief of the United States and which is before this Court last year in the Western Pacific case requires, the Government to pay transportation bills upon presentation prior to audit or settlement by the General Accounting Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.142" offset="208562">The Section goes on, however, to reserve the Government the right, should a post-audit disclose an overpayment to deduct the amount thereof from any amount subsequently found to be due to the carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.049" offset="268121">Now, in this case, the Government paid in compliance with the statutory mandate certain bills rendered by respondent promptly upon presentation without any audit.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.709" offset="306782">On the post-audit, and the General Accounting Office questioned the correctness of these bills.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.668" offset="330606">When the respondent failed to resolve the doubts that were raised in this regard and failed to make a refund of the determined overpayment, a deduction was made as authorized by the statute in the payment of a subsequent bill rendered by respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.979" offset="395912">This litigation was then instituted ostensibly on the subsequent bill to recover the deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.324" offset="421198">And the question before this Court is whether the carrier had the burden of demonstrating that the charges for these shipments, this earlier -- earlier transportation services, were correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.137" offset="468532">In other words, that they had not overcharged the Government on the bills which had been paid without audit in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.661" offset="494550">Now, the underlying facts are simply stated this.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.388" offset="513463">During 1944, the Government ships several carloads of naval property to points on respondent's lines in Massachusetts and Rhode Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.379" offset="545437">In each instance the bill of lading called for an open freight car of a particular length.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.986" offset="567902">In each instance, the initial carriers supplied a freight car of a longer length which was unnecessary for the particular services.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.029" offset="600085">And in rendering its bills, the respondent computed each charges on the basis of the minimum weights fixed for the larger car furnished rather than for the cars which had been ordered.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.014" offset="652016">On the post-audit, these facts came to light.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.441" offset="669675">Because no showing was made by respondent that the initial carrier had been unable to supply the ordered cars, which are the only circumstances concededly in which it could bill for the longer furnished cars, the General Accounting Office requested a refund between the charges for the cars ordered and the charges for the cars furnished.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.208" offset="756820">When respondent neither complied with this demand nor explained the failure to furnish the ordered cars, the deduction was made as authorized by Section 322 from amount subsequently found to be due the carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.176" offset="816692">In this case, it was a bill which the carrier had rendered in connection with the 1950 transportation services.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.423" offset="845636">Respondent then sued to recover this amount which had been deducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.248" offset="864967">In its complaint, however, it alleged no facts at all, respecting the 1944 shipments upon which the deduction had been predicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.429" offset="897672">Instead, the complaint simply alleged the performance of the 1950 service and the rendition of its bill therefore.</text>

            <label>Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal</label>
            <text syncTime="247.941" offset="991713">The period -- that period, as Your Honor will recall, of course, this was post war and there was the audit of the bills from the -- the wartime era.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.225" offset="1028807">We have some statistics in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.928" offset="1035703">And I think this Court in the Western Pacific case last year refer to similar statistics with respect to the -- the large number of bills that the General Accounting Office would require to audit especially in this -- this period that followed immediately after the war.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.575" offset="1094217">I am told now that -- advised by the General Accounting Office that the period necessary for audit has been substantially reduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.540" offset="1130057">Now, the -- I have indicated the complaint alleged nothing with respect to this 1944 shipments, alleged simply the performance of the 1950 shipments.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.970" offset="1167778">In its answer, the Government admitted the performance of the 1950 shipment and the correctness of the charges for that shipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.704" offset="1198811">The answer went on, however, to plea Section 322 as a statutory defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.170" offset="1224620">The words -- the answer pleaded that as authorized by the statute, the Government had adjusted the 1944 bills by deducting from the amount due on the 1950 bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.783" offset="1279060">It explained the basis of the determination of overpayment.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.656" offset="1290553">It went onto alleged that the respondent had never supplied for the Government with any facts respecting the availability of the cars which had been ordered.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.496" offset="1325976">The respondent there filed a response in which he had been -- in which is denied that it had overcharged the Government on this 1944 shipments.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.372" offset="1361398">And the issue was thus narrowed to the correctness of the charges for those 1944 shipments, in other words, to the merits of the administrative adjustment which the Government had made pursuant to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.559" offset="1422211">Now, both of the courts below have held that the burden of establishing the essential facts on this issue, the facts on the merits of the Government's defense based upon the statute rested upon the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.492" offset="1477904">And we submit, if it please the Court, that this holding is an error.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.122" offset="1496398">Now, we think that fundamental to any discussion of the burden approved question is the long established principle that a claimant against the Government has the burden of establishing the validity of its claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.244" offset="1556898">Now, traditionally, the -- the protection of the public treasury, bills submitted in connection with the rendition of a contractual service for the United States have been audited prior to payment under rulings of the Comptroller General recognized by the Court of Claims as far back as the 1880s.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.643" offset="1630563">In connection with this pre-payment examination, it is incumbent upon the claimant to produce evidence satisfactory establishing that claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.653" offset="1662537">If it doesn't produce that evidence, the evidence leaves some doubt as to the validity of the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.900" offset="1687510">The claim is not paid and the claim is recourse as a suit under the Tucker Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.223" offset="1704856">The Court of Claims has continually held in such a suit the claimant's burden as the same as on the administrative level.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.688" offset="1726694">It must alleged and proved the facts establishing clear liability in the part of United States for the amount assertedly due to the claimant.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.348" offset="1757309">Now, prior to the enactment of the Transportation Act of 1940, these procedures were concededly applicable to common carriers as well as to all other claimants.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.627" offset="1794508">The carrier was paid only that amount which the preaudit determined it was entitled to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.940" offset="1815719">It must be satisfied with the results of the preaudit.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.031" offset="1828049">It could bring suit under the Tucker Act and in that suit, it would have the obligation of demonstrating that its bills were correct and that the Comptroller General's determination was in error.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.981" offset="1867860">So we say that the issue here really narrows it down to this, and that is whether Section 322, by substituting a post-audit for a preaudit procedure was intended to or does in fact operate to relieve the carrier of this traditional obligation, which today is concededly applies to all other claimants against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.737" offset="1970887">Now, in our brief, we set forth in some detail the background of the legislative history of Section 322.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.038" offset="2000144">In sum, it is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.242" offset="2008921">If the section is -- was designed to serve a single purpose of enabling common carriers to obtain prompt payment on their bills.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.667" offset="2046642">It was inserted in the Transportation Act solely because of the insistence of industry spokesman that the delays attendant to the prepayment audit of bills was -- gave rise to economic hardship.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.042" offset="2108082">There wasn't the slightest intimation anywhere that the Government's right to require the carrier to establish a doubtful claim would be, in any wise, affected by the conversion from the preaudit to the post-audit procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.554" offset="2166178">To the contrary, it appears that all concerned believed that the public treasury would be fully protected by the right of deduction that was expressly placed in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.405" offset="2205571">The only inference, we submit, that the legislative history of this section permits is that the carriers were to receive the benefit of prompt payment but that the Government was to retain an impaired the right should a post-audit indicate to the Comptroller General that there was a basis for doing so, to put these carriers to their approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.309" offset="2289162">Now, in this connection, we think it is of no little significance that the Association of American Railroads, itself, the industry spokesman for the railroads, in seeking executive support for this change from the preaudit to the post-audit procedure indicated that if the Government pay bills upon presentation without examination to determine whether they were correct and should they subsequently determine that there had been an overpayment, the carrier would refund the amount of the -- administratively determine over -- overpayment reserving the right, of course, to bring suit in the Court of Claims if it were dissatisfied with the Comptroller General's determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="1592.910" offset="6371579">When this case started off, it was on a very elemental claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.736" offset="6390909">We thought that we were suing on a simple contract to collect transportation charges for services that we rendered in 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.447" offset="6429780">At the outset, the Government filed what -- what really purported to be a general denial of the charges in 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.707" offset="6474815">Subsequently, however, they filed a substitute answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.891" offset="6491533">And then, in that answer, they said, "All right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.066" offset="6500206">We admit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.678" offset="6506684">You did perform those charges -- those services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.349" offset="6521313">Those charges were proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.429" offset="6529672">And you are due those charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.942" offset="6539703">However, we have paid you, they said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.333" offset="6549316">"We paid you a check of $117 and some odd, and then we have taken out over $1000 which is our right under 322, Section 322 of the Transportation Act because six years prior in 1944, you furnished cars that were longer than the size of cars ordered."</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.792" offset="6643148">And we say -- we have determined that there were cars available of the right size.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.390" offset="6665509">So therefore, we claimed a credit for the difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.913" offset="6679615">Now, that point, of course, the elemental part of the case began to back down because as the right way, the Government then said to the District Court, "The railroad cannot, in anyway, claim relief here because they have not alleged the facts which would show that our claim as to the 1944 situation was true."</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.704" offset="6782746">And the railroad rebelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.902" offset="6787553">That railroad said, "We do not have to allege in any suit for a 1950 charge that we did not -- we're not overpaid in 1944."</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.797" offset="6835096">The thing hinged -- the -- the case hinged on that point and the Government refused to go forward any proof and so the claim is filed for summary judgment, would grant a summary judgment on the basis that there was no factual issue outstanding as to the 1950 charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.797" offset="6907089">And that as to the allegations in regard to 1944, they were a -- an affirmative defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.756" offset="6938958">They were a set off by way of counterclaim and that the Government had the burden of proof, so held the District Court and so held the First Circuit on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.842" offset="6999353">Now, the Government's position is based solely upon the fact that all of these new rights in judicial procedure come to the Government by virtue of the provisions of 322, Section 322 of the Transportation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.290" offset="7081064">And we say, and our position here today is, that it is neither just nor reasonable nor, in any way, necessary to attribute those particular properties through Section 322 and that those provisions are not nor can they be read into Section 322.</text>

            <text syncTime="1845.464" offset="7381786">First of all, it was an unfair advantage to be given to the Government as a shipper because once the Government was in commerce, they should be just like any other shipper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.173" offset="7416686">And the -- and the rule provided that the other shipper had to pay us upon delivery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.835" offset="7431314">Actually, I honestly believe that a railroad, at any time, could just stop serving the Government until they were paid like any other shipper, but, of course, naturally, they wouldn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.308" offset="7469140">Now, the second point I would like to make on that is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.360" offset="7481365">That the Government has placed great reliance upon what now has become to be a tenant of this, tenant of this, and that is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.768" offset="7530998">That it is traditional that everybody that has a claim against the Government must prove it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.271" offset="7565061">Well, now, we believe that, and we could have sued on the deduction itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.025" offset="7588049">And if we had sued on the deduction, we would have to prove whether or not we have the cars available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.335" offset="7613336">But I say that 322, in no way, permits me or prohibits me from choosing the forum in which I wish to go in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.122" offset="7652415">And I also say that it does not, in any way change, the judicial rules which allows the plaintiff to frame the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.099" offset="7688359">Now, the Government is trying to claim here that 322 changes all the -- the fundamentals of practice and procedure in that whenever the Government appears as a counter claimant against the railroad that all rules are on, new rules are on that the railroad then has to disprove the Government's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.235" offset="7788878">And we respectfully submit that that certainly would not be.</text>
