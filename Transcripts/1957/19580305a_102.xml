            <text syncTime="13.629" offset="54439">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.788" offset="75128">This is a condemnation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.568" offset="90175">The central and we think the determinative issue is, "When did the taking occur?</text>
            <text syncTime="32.228" offset="128836">Did it occur as the Government insists?</text>
            <text syncTime="37.639" offset="150465">When the United States took actual physical possession shortly after the filing of the case under an order of possession entered by the Court, or did it occur as the respondent contends?</text>
            <text syncTime="53.803" offset="215144">When a declaration of taking was filed with the payment they deposit, approximately three years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.349" offset="257358">The controversy which presents this basic issue here for a review arises because the respondent is an intermediate purchaser of the land through which ran the perpetual pipe-line easement taken by the Government and the case thus, involves an application of the familiar Anti-Assignment Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.176" offset="380656">The facts which are not materially in dispute maybe briefly summarized as follows, the case started in March of 1943 when the United States filed its petition to require a perpetual right-of-way or a pipe line or petroleum products over certain lands in Harris County, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.532" offset="498103">The property interest involved in the case is this perpetual easement confined to a strip, 33 feet wide, containing about 2.7 acres across a part of a 617-acre farm which then belonged to the respondent's predecessors entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.805" offset="599144">An order of possession was made by the Court the same day, and within 10 days thereafter, the Government's contractor, exercising the easement, went into actual possession and started the construction of the pipe line which was completed and which has been in use ever since sometime in 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.660" offset="710635">Now, somewhat over two years thereafter, by -- by now it is November 1945, the 617-acre farm was sold to the respondent, Dow, for a consideration of over $200,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.831" offset="795272">I must ask your indulgence because of the condition of my throat.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.590" offset="818260">The deed to Dow accepted certain other easements and then it recited, "And also except us to the right-of-way easements and the condemnation proceedings here and after mentioned.‚Äù</text>
            <text syncTime="221.564" offset="886178">The deed later states that it is expressly agreed that it is "subject to the existence of the following easement and proceedings."</text>
            <text syncTime="230.872" offset="923481">And item D of the list which follows is a specific identification of the condemnation case according to its caption in the District Court stage by reference to the list pendance record.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.591" offset="994325">In May of 1946, and I think this is now about seven months after the transfer, the Government filed a declaration of taking under the Act of 1931.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.207" offset="1060780">An estimated compensation was deposited therewith and a judgment was entered confirming those actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.369" offset="1093381">Five months after that and now it is October 1946, an amendment to the petition was made to name additional parties defendant for the first time including Dow.</text>

            <text syncTime="313.371" offset="1253460">In November of 1948, the commissioners appointed under the old Texas practice before the federal rules to determine the compensation, made an award of $4450 for the easement involved in this case after a hearing at which Dow appeared, presented evidence of value.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.133" offset="1348441">No notice had been served at that time upon Dow's grantors and they did not appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.055" offset="1380206">In October of 1949, the Government moved to set aside the award upon the ground that Dow had no interest in the land at the time the Government took possession in 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.837" offset="1443318">And therefore, Dow was not entitled to receive the compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.023" offset="1468082">This motion was dropped from the motion calendar without prejudice to the Government's right to bring it on for hearing at a later date.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.273" offset="1497025">It was not, I may say, withdrawn as to certify the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.137" offset="1524506">In 1955, this is now quite sometime later, this motion was renewed in connection with the Government's motion for a summary judgment, dismissing Dow as a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.517" offset="1602038">And this later motion was granted by the District Court in March of 1956.</text>

          <turn speaker="perry_w_morton" startTime="409.994" stopTime="808.765">
            <label>Mr. Perry W. Morton</label>
            <text syncTime="409.994" offset="1639967">Mr. Justice Harlan, I cannot answer for matters which I am not personally acquainted with, the -- I think the record will show it has moved reasonably promptly since it has come to my attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.554" offset="1714155">I don't know what took place before.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.610" offset="1722410">I can say many reasons for a delay or a time emergency and things of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.531" offset="1758041">Delay itself however is not a factor in the issue involved here and I believe that it has the argument developed so you will see that both the Government has what its set out to take and the parties are amply protected by the accrual of interest upon the compensation which will contemplate the award.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.075" offset="1844245">Well, have I answered your question, sir?</text>
            <text syncTime="467.740" offset="1870890">The Court shortly after this ordered granting the summary judgment against Dow and dismissing him, made another order setting aside the Commissioner's award and permitting Dow's grantors to withdraw a disclaimer which they had previously filed, and permitted Dow's grantors to pursue further proceedings which the Court directed be had under Rule 71A.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.326" offset="2001293">Any progress in that direction has however been precluded by Dow's appeal to the Court of Appeals, the decision of which Court favorable to Dow.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.393" offset="2045492">You have brought here for a review upon the Government's petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.476" offset="2069838">Well now, I should like to summarize very briefly and by headline only at this point the points which I shall hope to reach as the argument develops.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.309" offset="2121143">First, this taking was accomplished within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment when the United States physically took possession and built the pipe line in 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.794" offset="2187076">And it was at that moment that the claim to compensation for this easement arose and vested in those who were the grantors of the -- who were the owners of the property at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.915" offset="2243605">The basic principles of eminent domain are absolutely the same whether the federal power is exercised by means of physical seizure or condemnation proceedings or a combination of both or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.866" offset="2323435">Physical seizure gives rise to the claim for compensation whether the amount is determined in condemnation proceedings initiated by the Government as here or in proceedings brought by the owner under the Tucker Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.803" offset="2407131">The second point will be that the filing of the declaration of taking three years after the possession had been taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.293" offset="2445166">Did not destroy the existing claim, it did not divest that which had already vested.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.387" offset="2477453">It did not change the nature of the situation at all, so far as this controversy is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.980" offset="2511830">Thirdly, the rules here advocated by the Government have consequences far beyond with the boundaries of this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.891" offset="2555507">And our only -- the rules which can produce fair results to the United States and to the landowners with whom it has to deal in the administration of its very considerable land acquisition programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.786" offset="2627082">Now, I wish to return and develop my first point.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.166" offset="2648607">It seems to me that much of the confusion of the Court of Appeals was due to the failure to distinguish between a taking and a passage of title.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.534" offset="2706077">And this confusion has all wrapped up inside of it, a failure to distinguish between the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States on the one hand and corresponding but different provisions of the constitutions of many of the States including Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.264" offset="2796983">The power of eminent domain does not rest upon any expressed constitutional grant but rather as a basic attribute of sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.198" offset="2840764">The Fifth Amendment merely limits the exercise of that problem to the extent that it requires the payment of just compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.405" offset="2885590">However, it does not require as many state constitutions require that the compensation be paid in advance or contemporaneously with the taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.104" offset="2960405">And so, when the Federal Government physically occupies property in connection with unauthorized project or program, its action is a taking and it is not a tort or a trespass.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.312" offset="3037205">If the Government has not initiated its own condemnation proceedings as it did here in which the compensation may ultimately be determined, the sooner the better it will suit me.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.136" offset="3092480">The landowner nevertheless has his adequate remedy to obtain compensation for the taking by bringing his own case against the Government under the Tucker Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.830" offset="3139291">And consequently, unauthorized taking cannot be prevented by injunction nor can trespass damages be recovered against the Government, its officers or its agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.601" offset="3190387">Now, differing very much from this are the constitutions of the so-called first-pay states such as Texas --</text>

            <text syncTime="814.516" offset="3257992">Those First Pay constitutions mean in effect that the state power of eminent domain or in the case of its subdivisions or utilities, the state-given power of eminent domain can be exercised only through the medium of condemnation proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.861" offset="3343360">Indeed, under such constitutions, there could be no such thing as the Tucker Act and any physical seizure of or damage to property prior to the payment of compensation or in some States, prior to the giving of the security for payment, constitutes a trespass, a tort and not a taking.</text>

            <text syncTime="1425.789" offset="5703053">An examination of the facts as stated in the opinions will show that the possession had not been taken, so there are two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.354" offset="5729384">First, they were first-pay States and secondly, possession hadn't been taken anyway so what of it?</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.148" offset="5756552">Now, it is true of course that there are many cases in which there is the threshold question whether in fact a taking has occurred, and also many cases even some condemnation cases as well as Tucker Act cases in which the Court as a matter of fact, may have to determine whether that has been not only a taking but the duration or the extent of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.986" offset="5879850">I hasten to say that this case is not plagued with those questions because the United States unquestionably as a physical fact did take the perpetual easement involved in the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2390.562" offset="9562175">They go in, it's a wrongful act and not a rightful act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.716" offset="9590805">Now, if this weren't true, we'd have to make scrap of a whole draft of basic principles of federal eminent domain law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.650" offset="9646498">It is for example because of this basic concept that the valuation of property always has reference to the date of taking, not earlier and not later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.055" offset="9688189">It is also because of this that the just compensation includes not only the value of the property at the time of the taking, but an additional sum usually measured as interest as in the Seaboard case that I mentioned a while ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.439" offset="9753704">It is also because of this basic concept that the owner at the time of the taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.341" offset="9777319">And as Danforth said, ‚ÄúNot the owner at an earlier or later date, receives the payment.‚Äù</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.962" offset="9807830">Now, these very specific results flow not out of some so-called equitable rule as supposed in the last paragraph of the opinion of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.983" offset="9859866">They flow rather out of that great body of federal constitutional law bottomed upon the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.097" offset="9888287">This great body of law revolves around two basic substantive rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.483" offset="9913887">One of these is the governmental right to seize and use property for any lawful for public purpose and the other is the property owner's constitutional right guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.038" offset="9964147">And that means the property owner at the time of the taking to receive just compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.964" offset="9991837">These two substantive rights are the same whether the procedure employed for the determination of compensation happens to be a condemnation case brought by the Government as here or a Tucker Act case brought by the property owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.932" offset="10075638">Now, we can't do business on a double standard and that's one of our problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.443" offset="10093714">Now, I turn to a consideration hastily.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.491" offset="10105940">I should like to save some of my time for rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.551" offset="10122136">Now, the Declaration of Taking Act of 1931, which the Court of Appeals misconceived to be the hinge upon which this controversy turns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.083" offset="10164245">You will find the relevant portions of it in our brief beginning at the bottom of page 4 and over to the top of page 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.142" offset="10196532">In a nutshell, all I have time for, the Act provides that when the Government brings a condemnation case or at any later time before judgment, it may at its option file a declaration of taking and file a deposit therewith and make a deposit therewith of a sum estimated to be just compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.427" offset="10301649">And that -- at that time, the title passes to the United States of whatever interest it has described.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.336" offset="10337280">Thereafter, any deficiency as between the amount of the deposit and the amount later determined to be just compensation as of the time of the taking, draws interest at 6%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.421" offset="10409587">On proper application, the Court may order the deposited funds distributed to the persons entitled and may make any necessary orders respecting possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.132" offset="10464444">Now, I invite and this time I do have to read, your particular attention to Section 4, beginning near the bottom of page 5 of the Government's brief which I think the Court of Appeals overlooked.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.936" offset="10547722">I read, ‚ÄúThe right to take possession and title in advance of final judgment in condemnation proceedings as provided in this Act shall be in addition to any right, power or authority conferred by the laws of the United States and shall not be construed as abrogating,‚Äù I skipped a little piece, ‚Äúas abrogating limiting or modifying any such right, power or authority.‚Äù</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.573" offset="10682201">Now, by these very terms then, the 1931 Act provides merely an ancillary remedy as I said to you, Mr. Justice Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.777" offset="10723056">At the option of the Government within the framework of a condemnation case which has to find its authority in some other Act, usually the old 1888 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.802" offset="10775197">My point is that the declaration of taking does not stand on its own feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.731" offset="10794841">No condemnation case can be commenced under it alone for an authoritative treatment of the objectives and operation of this Act, I refer to the great opinion of this Court in Miller.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.409" offset="10849593">I summarized briefly from that case that the purposes were two-fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.487" offset="10869864">On the one hand, it relieves the Government of the burden of interest accruing on the sum which has been deposited from the date of the deposit to the date of the judgment, and on the other hand, it gives the former owner if his title is clear, immediate cash compensation to the extent of the Government's declared estimate of the value of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.722" offset="10970802">And so here, the filing of the declaration of taking simply made the deposit available to the former owners and reduced to that extent, the Government's interest liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.797" offset="11019180">Well now, I want to combine hastily at this point my first and my second points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.067" offset="11048229">The taking of all that the Government set out to take and all that it has ever taken in this case was completed in 1943 when it exercised its perpetual easement by physical appropriation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.565" offset="11110191">The right to compensation then vested in those who owned the property at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.475" offset="11129835">The declaration of taking did not change the nature of the taking which had already occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.982" offset="11155853">And a necessarily corollary of this is that it did not and could not divest or transplant the right to compensation which had already become vested in those guarantors by the operation of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.164" offset="11212591">And by the very terms of the 1931 Act, it does not abrogate, limit or modify any other right and that is as true of the landowner as it is of the United States, it is been so held and kept.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.092" offset="11272359">Now, for a few words about the Anti-Assignment Act and I must rush on.</text>

            <text syncTime="3334.338" offset="13337287">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.579" offset="13362260">I was enlightened and entertained by the questions asked by the Court of my opponent in this case and I hope they'll do me the honor of continuing then to answer a few of the points raised and dealt with in the opening argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.347" offset="13461316">I would say first of all about the date of valuation and the thought of the future of this case as contradicting the Miller case, the Court took care as all of the so-called "first-pay courts‚Äù do to provide that the date of valuation would for equitable reasons remain the date when physical possession was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.662" offset="13590570">There is no -- nothing in the decision below which would warrant the statement of counsel that there can be manipulations following the date of taking possession since there is no part of that decision which lends any comfort to any manipulation of valuation was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.763" offset="13674998">The Court specifically avoided that and prevented it happening in its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.176" offset="13704673">And I might say that Nichols on Eminent Domain, Section 3 plus the Section 8.5 (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.297" offset="13765172">That's 3 Nichols page 23, states clearly that the States adopting the first-pay rule also go to the date of possession as the date of valuation and they -- that particular horror is one which is not really in the case topside or bottom.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.034" offset="13868095">The Court also asked why the delay -- I also must plead ignorance of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.958" offset="13919817">I came into this case, and in fact, I started practicing law some years after this land was taken possession of by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.957" offset="13975824">But I am sure that the reasons were valid ones and I think the one that my opponent stated has been given voice in a number of instances and that is that the Government counsel in a wartime emergency is somewhat harassed and undecided on proper steps to take with reference to property, all of a sudden, needed for Government uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.830" offset="14091285">I would like to deal with the so called first pay and it's comparison to the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.270" offset="14125035">And I would say first that the distinction attempted to be drawn by my colleague for the Government that there is some miraculous difference between the constitutions of our several states and the Fifth Amendment provision that property taken for public use shall not be taken for public use without just compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.219" offset="14236839">I think that actually, the Constitution of Texas and of a good many of our States, certainly, most of the western ones are patterned almost verbatim on the Federal Constitution and there is no substantial difference in language between the like provision of the Texas Constitution and of the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.365" offset="14341433">I might say also that the consequences of first pay before taking title is a matter that has been passed upon by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.147" offset="14392529">It is some years ago but Mr. Justice Harlan in Cherokee Nation versus the Southern Kansas Railroad which is cited in our brief, dealt with that exact point and there, the Court adverted to the constitution of a State and said that the Federal Constitution was exactly the same and that if provided that within the meaning of the Federal Constitution, there is no taking until payment is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.745" offset="14542890">Now, that was made in answer to an argument presented on behalf of the Cherokee Nation that -- well what would happen here, you're condemning line for a railroad across our lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.694" offset="14602762">What would happen here if there's not enough money in the registry of the court to pay the amount that the jury feels we're entitled to?</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.896" offset="14643513">And the Court then answered that question by saying and announcing this -- announcing this rule that title does not pass in condemnation proceedings under the Constitution of the United States until provision is made for payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3679.395" offset="14717492">Now, that, I submit to the Honorable Court, is precisely the argument and the ruling of the first-pay States which are cited in the brief and certainly Texas is one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3697.071" offset="14788232">And on that point, there -- I just beg to differ with counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.214" offset="14812787">I think I understand that in the harassment of, other than Government counsel, occasionally acitation maybe made an error and if so, I certainly regret it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3718.417" offset="14873600">However, the Court will -- I'm sure, be able to read those cases and to see that they are cases where a possession was taken before the date of the transfer to the subsequent vendee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3735.271" offset="14940996">And that in those cases, the title obtained by the vendee carried with it the title to the property then subject to condemnation and the right to the award.</text>

            <text syncTime="3792.209" offset="15168784">313 United States, page 274.</text>
            <text syncTime="3797.566" offset="15190204">In that case, the State of Alabama had a tax rule or provision of tax law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3808.286" offset="15233045">I believe it was just under the statute or by liens for taxes would accrue as of a day certain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3816.040" offset="15264078">I believe it was the 15th of October of each year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3820.260" offset="15281006">However, the actual amount of taxes which would be paid by the owner of the land would not become known or in fact would not be fixed until a number of months later.</text>
            <text syncTime="3834.651" offset="15338580">After the date of October 15th but before the date when the amount became ascertained and known, the Government acquired title to premises involving that suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3848.279" offset="15393019">The Government then urged that since their title had vested before the date when the amount became ascertained, no tax is paid, the exemption of federal land should apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3865.661" offset="15462609">And this Honorable Court held, speaking through Chief Justice Hughes that while there was an immunity from suits, so that Alabama possibly could not levy or could not take the lands away or sell them at a -- at a tax sale against the Government, that's still the -- the difference between an immunity and a right existed, and that is very important right here in this case too.</text>
            <text syncTime="3895.813" offset="15583190">The immunity is one thing, the right is another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3900.292" offset="15601162">And I wish to say that it can be applied exactly in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3904.722" offset="15618821">The governmental power under its War Powers Act is one facet, it is one fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3910.319" offset="15641182">But it is merely a fact from that exercise of a power, the Government accrues no rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3917.572" offset="15670230">And -- and we submit, that the same line of reasoning would sustain the opinion and the decision of the court below in this case, if I have answered your question, Your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="5564.480" offset="22257894">That the point the Court was making in context was plainly that until payment was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="5577.990" offset="22311915">Title was reserved as a sort of a security transaction, a sort of -- may I give you what I think maybe a rough analogy.</text>

            <text syncTime="5611.099" offset="22444304">It is roughly that concept in Cherokee Nation for reason of which, with I think language that was unfortunate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5622.611" offset="22490384">I'd agree thoroughly with Cherokee Nation except for a few unfortunate words which I don't think were at all the hinge of the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="5638.059" offset="22552137">This title that Cherokee talks about was a thing which was just sort of held back as a necessity until payment was finally put on the counter.</text>
            <text syncTime="5651.004" offset="22603964">Now, I would go back to the great words of the Chief Justice if we could pay, if it were practical, if it were possible to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="5659.419" offset="22637610">The compensation with one hand and apply the acts with the other, we wouldn't have these problems, but we can't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5667.773" offset="22671047">It is a decidedly different thing whether these principles which are so important to our administration of this land acquisition program are bottomed upon some ‚Äúequitable rule‚Äù such as referred to by the Court of Appeals and which may mean one thing today and another thing tomorrow, and one thing here, and another thing that -- or whether these rights, these correlative substantive rights, the right on the one hand of the Government to take and the right on the other hand of the landowner to receive that just compensation which the Constitution says he shall have.</text>
            <text syncTime="5714.765" offset="22859024">That, we say is bottomed upon the Constitution and not upon some changeable concept of equitable considerations which are not even fully described in the Court of Appeals.</text>
