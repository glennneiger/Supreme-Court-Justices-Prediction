            <text syncTime="4.918" offset="19644">I'd like to start this morning by examining the record to point out some of the evils and abuses in economic problems that existed that made necessary this order.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.271" offset="81084">Now, the history of the field is recounted in some detail in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.674" offset="98638">I'd like to point out that portion of the record on -- from pages 357 to 360, and again from 364 to 396.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.795" offset="159138">Now, there are some 30 or 40 pages there of record which tell about the experiences of the small independent producers and land owners in the field and I'd like just -- to briefly explain to the Court what the situation was during that period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.717" offset="242834">And most of what I'm talking about --</text>

            <text syncTime="61.454" offset="245760">Mr. Stucky -- Mr. Stucky, may I ask you this question?</text>
            <text syncTime="67.560" offset="270211">It -- it seems to me that the -- the question here is whether the State of Kansas has the power to do this, not whether it was desirable, not whether these people have made some -- done some wrongful things, but it's a question whether the State of Kansas vis-à-vis the -- the federal government has the right to -- to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.246" offset="376895">Now, that's the thing that we're really interested in and not -- we can get the -- we can get the history and -- and the violations along, so forth, from -- from your briefs, but on the oral argument, we would like to hear the legal question discussed as to power and how your friend -- and particularly, how -- how you would explain the Phillips decision and the broad language that is in that decision.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="dale_m_stucky" startTime="124.261" stopTime="208.387">
            <label>Mr. Dale M. Stucky</label>
            <text syncTime="124.261" offset="496953">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.050" offset="500193">I might -- if I may explain why, I thought these facts might be helpful to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.345" offset="525375">We -- we point out that this order was necessary and proper as a conservation order and to protect correlative rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.697" offset="566753">Now, really, that is admitted in the record but Judge Rolston came here and said, “We don't admit that this was necessary for -- for conservation,” although it is admitted to the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.528" offset="618057">And the Solicitor General has come here and told this Court that any proper conservation measure, the Federal Power Commission would not object to.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.763" offset="662988">So I thought that if we would point out that the record shows that this order was necessary to conserve gas in Kansas and was proper to protect correlative rights, and if I could describe the economic circumstances which made it necessary and imperative.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.832" offset="731324">The fixed price, life of lease contracts and the distress commodity created by the pipeline monopolies and the destructive competition that I could overcome the inference that this was some kind of a -- an attempt to impose state power in some area where the federal government had supreme power.</text>

            <text syncTime="208.387" offset="833515">Are you -- does that mean -- are you implying that if you can show, that as a matter of fact, what Kansas has done here may demonstrably be a force or a pressure influence in the direction of avoiding waste that to that extent, the Phillips case is to be qualified?</text>
            <text syncTime="234.716" offset="938841">In other words, if assuming that the order does in fact fixed price of wellhead of gas going in interstate commerce and therefore, beyond the power of state agency under the Phillips related case, yet in those cases, it wasn't argued that although it does so, wasn't decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.889" offset="1031523">It also -- the state regulation would have some influence upon conservation that that's a qualification to the doctrine laid down, the Phillips case.Is that what you're going to argue?</text>

            <text syncTime="268.584" offset="1074260">Your Honor, I don't believe I'm going to argue that.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.370" offset="1081469">I -- we think the Phillips case does not apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.681" offset="1098710">I was -- I was about to recap these facts also.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.344" offset="1113339">I don't want to -- I don't care what you call it.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.344" offset="1129326">You can call this a price-fixing case if you want to or you can -- I -- as I prefer to call it a value attribution case.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.288" offset="1157120">What is the important is to see how the order operates and its purpose and what it was designed to do and how the 8-cent order did what this was designed to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="299.428" offset="1197662">Suppose your commission and your Court had said, “We do not battle over language, this is the fixing of price at the wellhead, was stopped that goes into interstate commerce, but although it is such a fixing of the price, it does also have or indeed the justification for it so far as Kansas' concern is that it have the restraining influence upon waste.Suppose your Supreme Court had said that, you'd still be defending the order?</text>

            <text syncTime="338.542" offset="1354083">That's the only thing we've got to deal within this realm, but they're empty words.</text>

            <text syncTime="357.592" offset="1430361">I will.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.057" offset="1436212">You ask me about the Phillips case.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.754" offset="1443004">The Phillips case has to do with the jurisdiction of the Federal Power Commission to regulate the price of gas after production and gathering has been completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.318" offset="1493264">Now, the first distinction is, that it has to do with the jurisdiction of the Federal Power Commission for rate making purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.578" offset="1530253">We take the position that this has -- that this case has nothing to do with the jurisdiction of the Federal Power Commission for rate making purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.016" offset="1567974">The Federal Power Commission's jurisdiction, its rate making jurisdiction was intended to fill a gap, which existed prior to 1938 and the State have the power that we're talking about prior to 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.488" offset="1621891">And we examined cases prior to 1938 and we discussed them in our briefs and I want particular to point out -- to -- to Your Honors attention, the green brief in reply to the Federal Power Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.683" offset="1670687">In 1938, the State was doing this sort of thing and this Court has repeatedly said that -- that this -- that the Natural Gas Act did not deprive the state's other rights, of any rights which it had prior to 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.216" offset="1740800">Now, I'd also like to point out that we -- that the Federal Power Commission in acting in its rate making capacity, and the Kansas Corporation Commission are not rivals in the same field of endeavor.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.755" offset="1802971">Ratemaking now at the wellhead in Kansas is -- is the prices are fixed by pipeline monopolies.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.877" offset="1843409">The Federal Power Commission contends it has ratemaking jurisdiction in Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.044" offset="1860127">Indeed it would like to have us treat this case as though it were the case is up here on certiorari, as to whether or not they have the right to fix the wellhead price and push -- and push -- and push Phillips back to the wellhead, but that's not this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.961" offset="1927837">We're talking about the -- the concurrent power which existed in the states prior to 1938, to conserve gas and protect correlative rights, and the record shows that this is the only way that these matters can be handled because of the peculiar conditions in the Kansas Hugoton Field.</text>

            <text syncTime="906.322" offset="3625273">The consumers who are deprived of this gas by this order are those inefficient uses -- users, that the President's Commission points out are wasting our natural resource and we're talking about a natural resource here that's being consumed at 500 times the rate the coal is being consumed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1092.265" offset="4369032">This Court told West Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.798" offset="4379167">This Court told West Virginia who was urging upon this Court the very considerations which we stand before the Court, urging upon it now and it told West Virginia, “We're sorry.” Conservation and protection of correlative rights is a matter for the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.585" offset="4454296">You have to take care of your own problem in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.978" offset="4467879">We're just interested here in an Act which uses a conventional -- a conventional approach to ratemaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.999" offset="4503928">We're just interested in that the --- the usual utility regulation and the usual utility regulation except for 7 (a), where they have the rights to issue certificates, opinions and necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.673" offset="4562651">You just decide what -- what a fair and reasonable return should be on some rate base.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.497" offset="4589923">Now, that's an over simplification of the Hope case but I -- I believe that the Hope case held that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.294" offset="4617091">And the reason I mentioned Mr. Justice Jackson's dissent was, that he's so vigorously urged, that the Federal Power Commission should conserve the gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.553" offset="4658155">That it should not be permitted to be used for these inferior purposes and wasteful usage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.156" offset="4688562">And that the Federal Power Commission should use price as a tool as he described it to conserve gas and this Court said and I believe rightly so that when the Natural Gas Act was passed in 1938, Congress was interested then in preventing these large pipeline monopolies, the holding companies based on the Federal Trade Commission's investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.339" offset="4801306">It was interested in -- in protecting the consumer from excessive rates -- excessive rates profits resulting from the interstate shipment of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.326" offset="4865254">Now, there is -- there is a conflict between this problem of -- of low rates at the consumer's end and an attempt to conserve gas by price attribution, as I like to call it and insist on calling it, at the other end.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.096" offset="4952294">There is a kind of a conflict but there's one thing that's -- there's not -- there's any -- no question about it and that is that there is a relationship between price, value and use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.607" offset="5006420">And that price is a tool and a very effective tool for conservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.465" offset="5029825">Now the question is, does the Federal Power Commission have the jurisdiction to use that tool or did that remain in the states in 1938?</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.765" offset="5070994">Now, there's nothing in the Act, in the history of the Act that I've been able to determine from the -- what study I was -- I've been able to have in our library particularly the opinions of this Court in the history of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.398" offset="5129509">Nothing to indicate in the history of the Act that the Federal Power Commission was going to step in and start regulating the production of gas for the purpose of conserving it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.121" offset="5188441">Indeed, all of the history of this Act shows that the states were assured time and time again that this was simply a rate regulation law which was designed to step into that area where the states had been told by this Court they could not act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.657" offset="5278616">So in answer to Mr. Justice Frankfurter's question, it seems to me the first thing I have to do is to start with 1938 and go back, and what do I look for?</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.881" offset="5323442">I go back and I Iook for a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.140" offset="5340473">I'll look for some case holding that this State of Kansas could not use the device of end use regulation or device of price as a conservation measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.503" offset="5405989">Now, I have not found such a case and I'm confident that counsel had not found such a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.808" offset="5435141">That power was not taken away from the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.768" offset="5451024">That power existed at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.053" offset="5468160">The tool is well-known.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.676" offset="5482684">Now if its use has been -- if its use has come late in the history of this country, I must point out to this Court that the states talked to the federal government how to regulate utilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.203" offset="5532735">We had State regulation first and then the federal government put in the ICC and the FPC.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.763" offset="5563037">Now it may seem novel that the State would use this tool as late as 1948 but price and use and conservation have -- the relationship between them have been long -- well-known for a long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.409" offset="5625626">As Dr. (Inaudible) said, Alfred Marshall, one of the greatest economists in the last century pointed out that relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.079" offset="5664287">So the State has used a tool.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.183" offset="5672647">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.670" offset="5674632">To conserve gas and protect correlative rights and there's no question in this case but what it served that purpose and it does serve that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.609" offset="5714338">Now, I say there haven't been any cases against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.811" offset="5731161">There haven't been any cases saying the states couldn't do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.394" offset="5741505">Now, what did the cases say?</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.568" offset="5750178">The cases said that states could -- could regulate end use by a regulation of real property telling -- telling the states they could not produce or telling the companies they could not produce gas if they use them in certain wasteful ways, wasteful manners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.239" offset="5836904">Now, a certificate by the Federal Power Commission permitting someone to use it as a carbon black plant certainly wouldn't prevail in view of the doctrine before 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.202" offset="5880790">The Federal Power Commission would have to give way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.212" offset="5896777">That's what this Court said in the interstate case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.146" offset="5904509">If there was any conflict, it's not the -- it's not the Supremacy Clause that -- that the -- that the Solicitor General mentions in his -- his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.927" offset="5943693">If there's any conflict, the federal government has to give a way in this area if the order is reasonably related to conservation and protection of correlative rights and that's why it was -- that's why I wanted to point out the record to show that it was reasonably related to this question and if it is, it's not the State of Kansas that has to give a way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.089" offset="6032300">This Court has said that state regulation, that the federal government may regulate these rates, certain rates, unless such regulation comes in conflict with valid state regulations of production and gathering and then the federal regulation must give way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.331" offset="6125296">Now, that's what the law is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.483" offset="6137835">Now, I mentioned the Champlin Refining Company case in which -- in which -- may it please the Court, the State of Oklahoma limited the production from the wells to 6% of what they produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.502" offset="6193946">Now, that wasn't price fixing but certainly limiting the production to 6% of what they will produce has a very direct affect on price and it was urged in that case whether -- that that was a violation of the Commerce Clause and this Court upheld that as a valid regulation of production in conservation of natural gas.</text>

            <text syncTime="1658.963" offset="6635833">I have one answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.997" offset="6643984">If this is a regulation -- if -- if this is a regulation of price at the -- it is at the wellhead and it's closely connected with production.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.076" offset="6700304">Now, I had -- I stated yesterday that we don't rely on the production of gathering exemption because we think our -- our position goes behind the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.916" offset="6735621">But if it is, if this is price fixing at the wellhead, it's not covered by the Natural Gas Act because it's so closely related to production and gathering which -- and this -- this Federal Power Commission has no jurisdiction over the production and gathering of natural gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.756" offset="6806988">It's not the Phillips case and it's not the Panoma case where the price was fixed after production and gathering had been completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.072" offset="6836245">So if you tell me that this is price fixing, I say it's price fixing at the wellhead and this Court has never said the Federal Power Commission has that power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.450" offset="6873757">And it's price fixing for the purposes of conservation of gas and thus comes within the exemption of the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.545" offset="6910119">Well, I think it goes further.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.230" offset="6916911">It existed before 1938 and it's not a regulation of a sale or a transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.775" offset="6943033">Now, I don't care what you call this order but there's a difference between regulating a sale and fixing a -- this isn't the highest price that existed in 1952 or where --</text>

            <text syncTime="1792.247" offset="7168940">How can the Federal Power Commission go out there in the Kansas Hugoton Field and take care of these many peculiar problems that result from these price discriminations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1831.064" offset="7324212">We're talking about an economic effect and it's a fair question to ask me, don't -- isn't this the same as -- doesn't this have an economic effect?</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.462" offset="7353783">And I say it has the same identical economic effect as does the severance tax at the wellhead.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.588" offset="7382309">It's no different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.590" offset="7390354">The severance tax fixes the price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.267" offset="7397042">The minimum price that you could pay for that gas was at least to pay the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.008" offset="7411984">You'll never pay it anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.972" offset="7419820">And if --if they refuse to agree on the tax, the State would say, "Well, we're going to pretend it's worth so much and we're going to take 2% of that."</text>

            <text syncTime="1925.943" offset="7703719">Now, the only thing wrong with that case is that apparently, the State had some kind of ownership in the wild -- in the wild animals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.158" offset="7752620">But the fact was that all of these went out of -- went out of the State and the State of Louisiana, and this is before 1938, levied a severance tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="1955.425" offset="7821688">Now that power existed prior to 1938 and the states were assured by the proponents of this bill that nothing was taken out, no power was taken away from it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2216.383" offset="8865437">Phillips was a rate case and the rates were fixed after production and gathering had ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.638" offset="8890514">The gas was produced, was sold to Phillips.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.696" offset="8902740">It put it through a processing plant and then it was -- it was sold after production and gathering has ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.211" offset="8928758">Now Panoma was an attempt on the part of the State of Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.570" offset="8946207">As this Court said in the Panoma decision, this is an attempt on the part of Oklahoma to fix a price for gas after production and gathering has ended, and that was a case that had to do with residue gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.511" offset="9009946">It was residue gas after that had been manufactured and -- and put through this plant and the residue gas, they -- they try to reach way out to residue gas and the difference as I stated yesterday between this and Panoma is that the same difference as between the Hall case and the Calvert case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.066" offset="9096255">Those -- the old Hall which was a -- a severance tax based on the value of the wellhead and the Calvert case which was decided the same term as Phillips where -- where Texas tried to levy what it called a "taking" tax after -- to -- to take the gas out of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.668" offset="9174622">In other words, to -- to add another tax on top of the severance tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.736" offset="9194893">And the same distinction exists between this case and Panoma as existed between Hall and Calvert.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.840" offset="9223314">One is wellhead and one is after production and gathering has ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.090" offset="9240346">And they did the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.074" offset="9248287">In the Calvert's case, they said, "Well, we -- it's just on the taking."</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.186" offset="9264692">And the inference was that the taking was from the -- from the wellhead, just a Cities Service says to this Court that because the order says, “all those who take gas, it applies to them.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.178" offset="9312653">Now, they don't take gas from the Hugoton Field within the meaning of the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.218" offset="9328849">It's a wellhead order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.154" offset="9332611">It might have been construed as applying to the purchaser.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.767" offset="9347030">But it wasn't so construed -- it wasn't so construed and it wasn't so applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.941" offset="9375660">So Cities Service stands in the place of the taker in the Calvert case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.144" offset="9424562">And I say that a new gap exist because the Federal Power Commission has no power or authority to use a well-recognized tool price rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.705" offset="9490808">Now, what does that leave us?It leaves us a hiatus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.448" offset="9505750">Our economists know that this is so and it'd known it a long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.506" offset="9526021">They know that -- that we are wasting our gas sinfully and it's a national property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.085" offset="9560294">Two-tenths of 1% of our total fuel resources are gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.514" offset="9577953">Only two-tenths of 1% are gas and we're using it 500 times as we are our coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.554" offset="9602194">That's a record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.640" offset="9606478">It's a flush production fuel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.732" offset="9618913">Everybody knows it's a problem and the Federal Power Commission is handcuffed because it can't use this well-recognized tool to conserve gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.290" offset="9657156">Now certainly when they passed the Natural Gas Act, they didn't attempt to take these pipeline companies out of the field of regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.218" offset="9696862">It was to -- designed to complement the powers of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.655" offset="9718596">So as I see this case, it's a question of whether this country can use a well-recognized principle of economics to conserve a precious natural resource or whether that tool can't be used although this Court and all courts have recognized who've discussed the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.548" offset="9818175">All courts have recognized the efficacy of the tool.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.011" offset="9831967">Now, we have a little problem getting our point across because this is a national problem, not just a state problem, but states have solved national problems before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.414" offset="9877629">We have a national interest in conservation but heretofore the states have protected that national interest and I think pretty well, at -- at least this Court has thought so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.332" offset="9925277">And the states can be entrusted to protect national interest.They may use them on ideas once in a while.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.933" offset="9951713">But this is not for many economists' point of view and the record will show that all of the -- all of the best talk on this matter agrees with this point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.302" offset="9993195">It admittedly achieves the purpose it was designed to achieve, conservation, protects the correlative rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.807" offset="10015138">It's reasonably designed for that purpose and we believe that when this Court examines the power which the states have, 1938, examines the hiatus which -- this is the -- in which Cities Service would try to create in this area of regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.179" offset="10104686">That -- and examines all of the -- the -- the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.542" offset="10130077">We think the -- the important cases in this case are the cases having to do with conservation that existed prior to 1938.</text>

            <text syncTime="2561.986" offset="10247941">I might say that my first connection with this case was back in the fall of 1952, Your Honor, when I was the chief counsel for the Office of Price Stabilization in Kansas and we got a wire out there in Kansas that are office to (Inaudible) the national counsel to go up and check on what was supposed to be a regulation to the price of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.816" offset="10363193">Possibly, it might be made by the Corporation Commission in the State of Kansas.</text>

            <text syncTime="2596.382" offset="10385450">I say this merely as a -- to show you our concept to the thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.368" offset="10413453">We went to Topeka.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.504" offset="10417946">We listened in on the evidence of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.394" offset="10433515">We were convinced that it was a conservation case and not a rate case and -- and we got out of it and we had nothing to do with the -- with the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.439" offset="10481685">I don't quote that to Your Honors as authoritative but that was my introduction to this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.906" offset="10507598">And I admit that when I first heard about this case, I thought that that was -- to use the phrase there, a rather screwing device to use price as a conservation matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.472" offset="10569874">However -- and Mr. Frankfurter pose this question earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.956" offset="10599758">Our Corporation Commission did hear evidence on the case and -- and I'm not going to go into the -- to the facts here because the courts already indicated that they will take them out of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.687" offset="10646674">The Court did hear evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.970" offset="10655869">They did find that this was an effective conservation tool, as Mr. Stucky has outlined very effectively to you, I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.944" offset="10699755">And the -- and the Supreme Court of Kansas both in the Kansas-Nebraska case which was the 8-cent case, and our Supreme Court in this case upheld the action of the -- of the Corporation Commission as being within the Kansas statute on conservation which is Chapter 55, 701 to 713, and I think that that statute is referred to by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.972" offset="10815843">In the case of FPC versus the Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Company is one of the traditional powers of the -- is one of the conservation statutes and one of the -- the powers of the state head prior to the enactment of the Natural Gas Act in 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.755" offset="10902988">Now, I wanted -- any power that the federal government has as -- as Justice Whittaker indicated a while ago on the federal -- on -- the Natural Gas Act was necessarily Commerce Clause of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.135" offset="10972473">I want to direct my remarks for a few minutes to another aspect of it that has been touched on, but I think it is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.326" offset="11029211">Mr. Stucky is -- has outlined the fact that -- it is our feeling that these powers are concurrent that the -- the State has the right to act on the conservation field, that the federal government and the FPC are -- and the FPC does not have the authority to act in the -- in the field of conservation, that they do not have the authority under inferences from the judgments of this Court, that -- that they can even use price as a tool for conservation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2805.264" offset="11221055">I would like to call the Court's attention to the fact that the green brief which Mr. Stucky indicated to the Court contains an outline we think very clearly our thinking on the proposition and -- and surely before the argument in this case, there was another green brief filed here by the attorney generals of 12 of the states and I think subsequently a white one by Illinois in which they outlined some pertinent observations we feel about the -- the powers of that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.607" offset="11366400">And I would like to direct my remarks for a few moments along those lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.293" offset="11397120">We're all conscious to the Tenth Amendment and I know that recent decisions of this Court in the last 20 years, shall we say, many of them have -- have brought about the many interpretations in the field of constitutional law and I am not going to stand here and -- and make any oration about states right because my political philosophy is not oriented in that matter but I do think that the -- that the Tenth Amendment, the reservation of the rights of the states at this matter deserves a consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.318" offset="11553228">I don't think that the matter of the correlative rights have been going into (Inaudible).</text>
