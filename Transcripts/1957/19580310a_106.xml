            <text syncTime="34.745" offset="138971">The centric issue in the case is whether certain regulations issued by the stockyard owner in Denver pursuant to the Packers and Stockyards Act are invalid as a matter of law or stating the question in the language used by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.067" offset="244193">The question is whether the regulations in the absence of evidence are illegal on their face.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.415" offset="289646">These regulations were issued by the stockyard owner with respect to the furnishing of what the statute calls reasonable stockyard services.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.628" offset="362475">The Denver Stock Yard has been posted for regulation under the Packers and Stockyards Act since 1921.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.097" offset="400300">And the market agent says and the dealers at that Stock Yard are also subject to the regulatory terms of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.782" offset="451082">This litigation had its origin in a complaint which was filed with the Department of Agriculture by a market agency at the Denver Stock Yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.865" offset="511373">A market agency is by statutory definition, a person engaged in the business of buying or selling livestock on a commission basis at a posted stockyard.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.426" offset="585665">A complaint in this case was filed by the Producers Livestock Marketing Association, a corporate entity which is registered with the Secretary of Agriculture as a market agency at this stockyard.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.444" offset="653688">That is to say the complainant is engaged in the business of buying and selling livestock on a commission basis at the Denver Stock Yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.305" offset="713143">It is alleged in the complaint that certain regulations issued by the stockyard owner are for various reasons invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.311" offset="761208">And the prayer of the complaint is that the Secretary of Agriculture, after an adjudicatory proceeding, set aside the Stock Yard Company's regulations or as the complaint terms it, annulled those regulations.</text>

            <text syncTime="273.090" offset="1092336">The Packers and Stockyards Act imposed certain duties on a stockyard owner and a market agency.</text>

            <text syncTime="300.624" offset="1202469">Now, the first of the two statutory duties that are involved here is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.316" offset="1241234">The statute provides that it shall be the duty of a stockyard owner and a market agency to furnish upon reasonable request without discrimination, reasonable stockyard services at the stockyard.</text>

            <text syncTime="346.147" offset="1384490">No, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.923" offset="1395670">The first duty then that's specified in the statute is the duty on the part of a stockyard owner and a market agency and this is the very language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.556" offset="1438198">It's the duty on the part of a stockyard owner and a market agency to furnish upon reasonable request without discrimination, reasonable stockyard services at the Stock Yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.512" offset="1490024">Now, the pivotal term in that statutory language, the pivotal term reasonable stockyard services is not defined in the statute, neither is there any definition of the word reasonable as it's used in that term, reasonable stockyard services.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.387" offset="1573512">There is, however, a statutory definition of a part of that term, namely, stockyard services as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.027" offset="1612069">The statutory definition of that term is in words of -- throughout generality.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.532" offset="1642057">The definition is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.892" offset="1651566">The term stockyard services means facilities undefined or services undefined in connection with the receiving of livestock, the watering, the feeding and the holding of livestock and the buying and the selling and the marketing of livestock and the shipment of livestock at a posted stockyard.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.370" offset="1749473">So the first duty is that a stockyard owner and a market agency must furnish upon reasonable request without discrimination, reasonable stockyard services.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.589" offset="1802344">The second duty specified in the statute is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.301" offset="1825123">It shall be the duty of a stockyard owner and a market agency to issue, observe, and enforce just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory regulations with respect to the furnishing of stockyard services.</text>

            <label>Justice Charles E. Whittaker</label>
            <text syncTime="475.062" offset="1900147">As of duty?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="neil_brooks" startTime="476.191" stopTime="795.499">
            <label>Mr. Neil Brooks</label>
            <text syncTime="476.191" offset="1904744">A duty, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.732" offset="1910909">That's the very language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.514" offset="1918015">It shall be the duty of a stockyard owner and a market agency to issue, observe and enforce just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory regulations with respect to the furnishing of stockyard services.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.564" offset="1986247">The last statutory provision in the group that Justice Douglas probably referred to is this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.671" offset="2022609">The statute says that any person, that's the term in the statute, any person, who has agreed by what he regards as a breach of one of those statutory duties, may file a complaint with the Department of Agriculture.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.250" offset="2088960">Also, the statute provides that the administrative agency itself may, on its own motion, file a complaint if it regards inappropriate in the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.305" offset="2145176">The statute then provides that in either event whether the complaint is filed by a private person or whether the complaint is filed by the administrative agency itself in either event.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.227" offset="2204839">If the Secretary concludes on the basis of the hearing record and the statute refers to what it calls a full hearing, if the Secretary concludes on the basis of that record that any rate or charge or any regulation or practice in connection with the furnishing of stockyard services is unjust, unreasonable, or discriminatory, then the Secretary may set aside the rate or charge or the regulation or practice, and the Secretary may, on the basis of that record, prescribe the rate or charge or the regulation or practice which is and will be just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.976" offset="2435866">Those I believe are the three statutory provisions which are at the center of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.796" offset="2487171">The complaint, as I said earlier, was filed by a market agency asserting that certain regulations issued by the stockyard owner are violative of those statutory provisions and are also in other respects that I will get to later, illegal and invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.655" offset="2586540">It was decided by the administrative agency and that decision appears in the record that this proceeding should go forward on the basis of the complaint filed by the Producers Livestock Marketing Association as the complainant and the of course the Denver Union Stock Yard Company, the stockyard owner as the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.603" offset="2690403">Accordingly, the complaint was served on the respondent, an answer was filed denying the various allegations in the complaint as to whether or not these regulations are just, reasonable and nondiscriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.558" offset="2754142">The answer filed by the respondent admits -- admits that it issued the regulations as they're quoted in the complaint and it admits that the complainant is registered with the Secretary of Agriculture as a market agency at Denver.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.363" offset="2821433">But in all other respects or at least in all other material respects, the answer denies the factual allegations in the complaint and demands what it calls strict proof on the part of the complainant.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.312" offset="2905234">We come now to an interesting and unexpected development in the administrative proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.919" offset="2943582">This case was assigned to a hearing examiner and the parties were preparing for the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.985" offset="2975869">The respondent filed a motion with the hearing examiner for a subpoena duces tecum for certain books and records of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.303" offset="3021113">It being alleged in the motion filed by the respondent that those books and records of the complainant were relevant and material to the practices in the market which gave rise to the issuance of these regulations and which would show the need for the regulations and the reasonableness of the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.949" offset="3119752">The complainant resisted the issuance of the subpoena duces tecum although it did not deny and the record shows it.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.023" offset="3168026">It did not deny the relevance of the books and records.</text>

            <text syncTime="2334.661" offset="9338567">And the result would be that this -- the market would be -- would inevitably decline without any ability to help itself in the interest of the patrons both the buyers and sellers of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.582" offset="9398230">Now, the Stockyard Act, the whole background of it is definitely grounded in the theory that it's in the interest of the farmers and the producers of the area to have a market, a central market such as this great stockyard at Denver is which would provide free competition in the bidding and the sale of livestock which would provide an ample supply or different kinds of livestock at all times to suit different buying demands and which would be the price fixing setting mechanism through that whole marketing area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.712" offset="9558831">As everyone knows in the industry, prices that are established at great markets like Chicago and Omaha and Denver and the large markets have a tremendous influence over the transactions of livestock made locally and out into the country.</text>
