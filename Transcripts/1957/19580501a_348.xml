            <label>Mr. John J. Wilson</label>
            <text syncTime="12.180" offset="48692">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.569" offset="70217">The complaint in this case was dismissed with prejudice by the District Court at the pre-trial stage, the failure to comply with the discovery order in a situation in which due to no cause in the part of the petitioner, the petitioner was unable to comply with the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.693" offset="194769">I should like to discuss a few of the procedural facts first before I come to the principles of law which I think are controlling here.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.428" offset="253701">This petitioner is a Swiss Holding Corporation which filed suit in 1948 under the Trading with the Enemy Act to recover most of the stock of General Aniline &amp; Film Corporation, an American Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.538" offset="342100">The respondents filed answers in which they alleged that the petitioner was "enemy tainted" and did not own the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.961" offset="403749">The requirements being that the petitioner was holding the property as "for IG Farben of Germany".</text>
            <text syncTime="113.972" offset="455784">Shortly after the complaint was instituted, cross motions were filed for discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.658" offset="486609">And the Court -- the District Court required the custodian to disclose to the petitioner a quantity of some 23,000 relevant documents in its -- his possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.724" offset="546795">At the same time, the respondents had moved not only for the discovery of the petitioner's own records and those of a wholly owned subsidiary but the records of a private Swiss bank known as Sturzenegger &amp; Company in Basel, Switzerland with which the petitioner had close business relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.386" offset="641463">It was the position of the petitioner that its records were relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.774" offset="667063">It made no resistance to the motion for the production of its own records.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.257" offset="689006">It resisted vigorously the request that it produced the records of the Swiss bank upon the ground that it did not have possession, custody or control of those records as required by Rule 34 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.752" offset="766955">We also raised the point with the Court invoking the exercise of a benign discretion that due to the banking secrecy laws of Switzerland, it would be difficult if not impossible even should the bank voluntarily produce -- would be willing to give up the records for us to obtain them for inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.655" offset="878550">We also resisted the imposition of this discovery order as far as the Sturzenegger Bank was concerned upon the ground of an inadequate designation of the records.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.323" offset="941244">And so it happens that this element of control, which we say was never properly resolved against us and the proper designation of the records to be produce are basic difficulties here that appointed us throughout in this whole case.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.911" offset="1027553">Judge Laws heard arguments in our position to the production of the Sturzenegger records.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.726" offset="1062870">Now, Sturzenegger who was the managing partner of this private Swiss bank is one of the principal directors of the petitioner.Now, I think that had a great influence with the district judge in imposing upon the petitioner a requirement that it produce not only its own records but the records of this private Swiss bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.308" offset="1185228">Now, prior to the institution of our suit, an agency of the Swiss government known as the Swiss Compensation Office had made an investigation into the national character of both Sturzenegger and the petitioner and several reports were issued in which it was determined that these companies were Swiss in character.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.955" offset="1311765">The principal reason I believe why the respondents urge the Court to include in its discovery order against us, the requirement that we produce, the records of the private Swiss bank partnership, was because this business relationship which the petitioner had with the Swiss bank was not only that of having the Swiss bank as its house bank but it also had a participation in the partnership of this bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.983" offset="1471843">Now, the bank was a -- had two partners and the participation of the petitioner in this case, not the Sturzenegger.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.801" offset="1515102">It was the unlimited partner, the general managing partner was a small Swiss Franc investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.195" offset="1548748">A corporation known as "Industry Bank," which was not a bank but a Swiss corporation, was a limited partner with a large Swiss Franc investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.492" offset="1593887">And the petitioner in this case had what is known as a "sleeping participation,‚Äù a thing which is unknown to Anglo-Saxon law but has its roots perhaps in German law.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.040" offset="1644147">And we have maintained throughout that it is more akin to that of an investment than it is to a sound partner or any kind of a partner.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.654" offset="1690540">Now fortunately for us, we did not have to rely upon oral testimony as to the terms of the so-called partnership agreements.There were successively three or four, they have been before the Court, they had written out great detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.851" offset="1767340">No one has suggestion -- suggested that they are any wise not genuine.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.626" offset="1790433">And those agreements spell out this very limited participation of the petitioner, practically no say in the management, a veto on certain kinds of unusual loans.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.992" offset="1855948">And upon the point of the ability to see the books and records of the partnership, a very unusual provision exists and that is it provides that the delegates of the respective participants, Industry Bank, the limited partner on the one hand, the petitioner with the participation on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.574" offset="1946227">Their delegates could examine the books and records of the partnership but they had to keep secret in which they saw.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.608" offset="1986351">Now, a very unusual provision to the point of view of Anglo-Saxon law but one which my implication spells out something of very great importance to us, namely, that the petitioner had no control over the books and records of the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.768" offset="2058971">And thus, it was unable to produce them by contract or by law or by any other arrangement in Switzerland.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.402" offset="2109544">Despite our resistance of this imposition of this order upon us for discovery, we were ordered in 1949 to produce our own records and those records and the records of the Sturzenegger Bank.We made our examination of the Government's records first.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.778" offset="2183105">The deposition of Dr. Sturzenegger which had been in progress prior to that time was resumed and completed to the extent of over 6000 pages of testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.101" offset="2224379">We are now reaching the summer of 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.289" offset="2241097">At this time, the gentlemen from the Department of Justice are proceeding to Switzerland for the purpose of making inspection which the Court directed.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.544" offset="2278087">Before they arrive there about the 15th of June 1950, the Swiss Federal Attorney who is the second man in command of the Justice Department of Switzerland, issued a confiscation order based upon what's called Preventive Police Power in Switzerland and referring to the Bank Secrecy laws and the Economic Espionage laws of Switzerland and expressly seizing and confiscating all the records of the Swiss bank to prevent their disclosure to the Attorney General of the United States in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.133" offset="2452480">Now, respondent's counsel examined the records of the petitioner.Now, there is some contest as to whether they saw all of them but that's not in dispute in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.812" offset="2495216">In the fall of 1950, a motion to dismiss was filed on the ground that we had not complied with the order for discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.674" offset="2538684">And in the hearing before the District Court at that time, the district -- the issue was raised as to whether the petitioner in this case had denied and conspired with the Government of Switzerland for the purpose of procuring this seizure order.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.335" offset="2605244">It was also argued that this was an illegal order.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.265" offset="2621022">It was also argued that the petitioner had done little or nothing to be relieved of the order.</text>

          <turn speaker="john_j_wilson" startTime="663.395" stopTime="1056.696">
            <label>Mr. John J. Wilson</label>
            <text syncTime="663.395" offset="2653518">It was a constructive seizure only, Mr. Justice Whittaker.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.896" offset="2667520">But I think that the parties in this case have clearly dealt with the proposition as if it were an actual physical seizure.I think that this Court should regard it as the equivalent of an actual physical seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.472" offset="2773786">Justice Laws -- Judge Laws referred this matter to a special Master to take testimony but then ensued a very long proceeding in the cause of which it was found that there was oddly no evidence of any conspiracy between the Swiss Government and the petitioner in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.028" offset="2860095">It was found that the seizure was valid under the Preventive Police Power of Switzerland.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.905" offset="2879530">It was found that the petitioner in this case had done everything which he could be expected to do to try and have them relieved of the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.844" offset="2915370">And on the basis of that report, the petitioner moved for its ratification.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.664" offset="2950583">The respondents came in and filed exceptions but renewed their motion to dismiss upon the ground that even if it were found that the petitioner were in entire good faith that our inability to produce these records had disrupted the established procedures which were in effect that when a litigant comes into court, it should be prepared to make full disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.452" offset="3061760">And despite our complete inability and our innocence in the situation, the suit should be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.927" offset="3091644">In February of 1953, Judge Laws wrote an opinion in which he had adopted that philosophy.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.339" offset="3121319">He announced however that this was a novel doctrine and that he would give the petitioner an opportunity to try to get the records.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.450" offset="3161757">And so he extended the time for approximately three months.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.195" offset="3180774">In the meantime, certain petitions have been filed with the Swiss Federal authorities in an effort to try to pry these records loose.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.037" offset="3224137">And it began to develop that if we could obtain the waivers and consents from the bank customers who in Swiss -- one of the owners of the banking secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.923" offset="3279621">Under the supervision of the federal government, these records might be released or some of them might be released.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.152" offset="3308565">So we pursued that course for several months in 1953 and we're able to ship over here some 63,000 records within -- sought more time because this is a very tedious process.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.421" offset="3377633">And it began to develop but not only did we need the primary records of the custom of the bank -- primary consents of the custom of the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.672" offset="3410651">But if to payee of the check was involved, we call that a "secondary waiver."</text>
            <text syncTime="858.494" offset="3433953">We needed his waiver and his will.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.433" offset="3445656">So in the fall of 1953, on one of our motions to extend the time ought to be relieved upon -- of the order upon the basis of substantial compliance, the Court asked whether we could give any assurance as to whether we could then get full compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.019" offset="3532069">I told the district judge that I could not give him that assurance but that I'd never given up hope and that was the opportunity to continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.846" offset="3571357">Strangely enough and this is a paradox in a case which is full of paradoxes that the district judge said I think from this situation in Switzerland where you lack control that you will never be able to get these records.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.858" offset="3643350">So we might as well save you this frustrating effort which you have been making for years and we have just dismissed the case finally.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.185" offset="3672712">Now, mind you if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.093" offset="3680340">The paradox that I referred to is this element of control which Judge Laws had find -- found only prima facie to exist when he issued the order in July of 1949 and which he had defined in order to support the legality of the discovery order under Rule 34.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.360" offset="3769365">He found later on that the absence of that control was the reason why we couldn't produce and why we should be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.846" offset="3811370">Now, as a result of that, we took an appeal to the Court of Appeals and the case was argued and submitted and decided in June of 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.393" offset="3857554">It was affirmed in its entirety with the modification allowing us six months from the time that the mandate came down in which we tried to get the records.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.923" offset="3907605">Now, we intended to apply for certiorari and we stayed the mandate and did apply to this Court for certiorari.Certiorari was denied in January of 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.615" offset="3966433">The six months began to run on the 24th of January 1956 and so we began again previously to -- by this waiver and consent method to get records.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.659" offset="4018573">And by June of 1956, we had produced in this country and tendered for inspection almost 200,000 banking records of the Sturzenegger Bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.633" offset="4070504">Now, I said earlier and I don't want to take too much time on it, our brief is clear on it, that the Court's designation was unclear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.328" offset="4101224">There was no designation of all the records of the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.464" offset="4113763">There was a designation based upon certain language in the Swiss compensation and all the reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.752" offset="4134975">There's a great controversy about how many records we had to produce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.372" offset="4153469">There'd be a great controversy as to when we had made full production.I</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.013" offset="4176039">can't assure this Court for 200,000 of the full production but I don't have to use any argument to submit that 200,000 are substantial compliance for the discovery order.</text>

            <text syncTime="1443.299" offset="5773166">In June, when we began to see that the six months were lapsing, we moved for more time, we reported this production.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.023" offset="5803990">By this time, we've had our Swiss associates who had certain contacts with the Swiss government and a plan was evolved whereby the Swiss government propose that a neutral investigator selected with the approval of the American court, the Swiss authorities, the Department of Justice and ourselves would go into the Sturzenegger Bank, see the balance of the records that are relevant, seek waivers of those people and in cases where they did not succeed then we might proceed by letters rogatory which would have the effect of invoking judicial assistance in the Swiss courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.026" offset="5960098">Now interestingly enough, the courts of the different cantons of Switzerland vary on this point but the Court of Basel where the Swiss Bank was located, would permit the invasion of banking secrecy in a court proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.070" offset="6024255">And so the scheme or plan which was proposed was one which would get us into the judicial stream in Switzerland by letters rogatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.389" offset="6061453">And thus, we hoped produce the remainder of the relevant Sturzenegger documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.715" offset="6086844">That plan was rejected by Judge Laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.339" offset="6097293">It was affirmed by the Court of Appeals and it was from the judgment of affirmance that we came to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.881" offset="6131461">Now by this time, we had produced as I say a quarter of a million papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.465" offset="6157793">The Government had made other elaborate discoveries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.483" offset="6169913">They had taken Dr. Sturzenegger's deposition as I said or 6000 pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.698" offset="6190707">They had made discoveries of their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.362" offset="6205440">We made a tender to the Department of Justice of these records remove the judge to hold a hearing to determine if these were not substantial compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.887" offset="6251520">He summarily disposed of the matter by not granting our motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.071" offset="6276284">Now, the Sturzenegger books are very much in the minds of the Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.162" offset="6304601">And there were 110 Sturzenegger books involved which were never brought over but which we tendered to them to the extent that the waivers and consents permitted inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.006" offset="6351935">So on about the 3rd of August of 1956, we made a tender of these records and of the Sturzenegger books to the extent available.And we asked Judge Laws to determine that this was substantial compliance, as I say, he refused to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.942" offset="6427690">He maintained the same attitude that he did before as did the gentleman from the department that it wasn't necessary for them to look at one paper until they could be assured of all of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.912" offset="6475546">Now, that's my factual basis which I think will be adequate for my presentation of -- of certain law points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.761" offset="6515043">When the Court granted certiorari in this case, in its order it asks us to discuss amongst other things, the power of the Court -- to dismiss and the propriety of the dismissal under Rule 37 for failure to obey in the absence of evidence and the finding of refusal to obey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.520" offset="6629982">Now, we find the gradual thought with the basic findings in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.852" offset="6647327">Time will not permit me to discuss those but we have set forth in our brief and in the appendix to our brief why we think Judge Laws made inadequate findings and no findings at all on the original order of discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.995" offset="6711902">But if there is one thing about which there is no dispute in this case, it is that we had no power to produce these records.</text>

            <text syncTime="1717.657" offset="6870622">Exactly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.933" offset="6875638">Now, there are three -- there are three points of control in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.140" offset="6900506">We attack control at the original level, the factual control, the lack of contractual control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.904" offset="6939585">We also raised the question of lack of control as a result of the seizure by the Swiss Federal Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.492" offset="6969887">That's the main element of control which I'm arguing today to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.231" offset="6992875">Now in this Special Master's findings and conclusions, he reported also that the cause of the Swiss secrecy laws which made it necessary that the customers of banks shall consent to the release of banking secrets but there was a third reason why we lack control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.683" offset="7078661">Now, we had no -- neither the bank nor ourselves had the power to release those records without the consents of the customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.169" offset="7112620">Now, let me say at this point, if the Court please, that we are not invoking Swiss secrecy law here as a privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.640" offset="7158491">We are well aware of the universal Anglo-Saxon doctrine that the law of the forum will determine the extent of the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.426" offset="7205616">We concede readily that there is no privilege of the United States with respect to banking secrecy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.527" offset="7234038">And we are in no wise invoking banking secrecy as an excuse for production here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.981" offset="7267892">Now, there's a wide difference between us on that point because the Solicitor General I'm sure will argue to the direct contrary and he will use that as a premise as he does in his brief from which a series of conclusions to the opposite of our position as argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.882" offset="7335497">So we say that control that that the effect of Swiss secrecy laws here was to establish a fact of lack of control just the same as if these records had been burned or hidden otherwise destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.424" offset="7413656">The Swiss secrecy laws are of only secondary importance in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.940" offset="7435703">Their effect is remote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.538" offset="7446152">They created a condition upon these records which made them physically inaccessible to us.</text>

            <text syncTime="1874.052" offset="7496202">Another word Mr. Justice Black that I find (Inaudible) use of power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.084" offset="7516264">They use it and we use it in the -- in the Judiciary Act of 1789, possession and power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.440" offset="7541760">And I'd like to think of control in the sense of the power to produce, the ability to produce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.234" offset="7568927">Now, going back to your -- the Court's invitation as to what to discuss, we find that we deal with three elements here, Rule 37 which is the sanction rule for failure to comply in the discovery package of rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.316" offset="7653251">We find Rule 41 which is the rule for involuntary dismissal itself, the one which keeps the Court operating orderly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.003" offset="7703928">And then we find the question of how much inherent power does the Court have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.422" offset="7733603">Now interestingly enough, the district judge went on all three points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.946" offset="7751784">The Court of Appeals (Inaudible) on the 37 point because the Rule 37 (b) on which he relies uses the words "refuses to obey."</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.927" offset="7807687">Judge Laws walked the word refusal into the word failure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.045" offset="7828167">The Court of Appeals could not accept that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.307" offset="7837153">The Court of Appeals found a simple premise to their way of thinking in Rule 41 (b) where the word "failure" appears without the word "willful" or without any connotation of willfulness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.374" offset="7885427">The Court of Appeals also invoked the inherent power of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.495" offset="7905907">My opponents in their brief seemed to have abandoned 41.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.710" offset="7930776">They gave lip service to 41.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.219" offset="7940807">They have gone back and attempted to support Judge Laws on refusal on this stupid definition that refusal means declination and declination means failure.</text>

            <text syncTime="2003.413" offset="8013636">I would think that actually Rule 41 is the dismissal rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.447" offset="8033698">I think 37 provide the ground rules, Mr. Justice Whittaker, for when to impose the sanctions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2019.069" offset="8076225">Now -- then all the parties were embracing this nebulous undefined inherent power because willfulness was not written into that and it looked like this was something that was most simply dealt with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.716" offset="8146860">Now, my answer is twofold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.234" offset="8156891">My answer is that whether it'd be under 37, whether it'd be under 41 or whether it'd be under inherent power, there must always be the element of willfulness.</text>

            <text syncTime="2086.409" offset="8345600">What -- as I -- as I want to emphasize while we do not abandon our attack on the original discovery order, our main predicate here today is that the seizure order by the Swiss Federal Attorney had deprived us of control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.090" offset="8404323">Now, when Judge Laws made his final order of decision of dismissal, he found conclusively said he that we had control over the Sturzenegger papers but for the seizure order of the Swiss Federal Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.997" offset="8459912">So he recognizes the same predicate upon which I rely here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.329" offset="8481228">Now, I was saying to the Court that all three of these sources of power are dependent upon willfulness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.042" offset="8512157">If you go back to Rule 41 (b) where this -- it says "if you fail to obey an order," that's the order under which cases are dismissed for one of prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.204" offset="8556774">But certainly, if a lawyer and his client knows that a case is called -- to be called at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.160" offset="8584568">On the way to the Court as tomorrow morning, they have to do an automobile accident and they end up in the hospital at 09:50.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.897" offset="8615497">And the judge dismisses the case because they're not there at 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.100" offset="8632320">It had passed 10 if he's told that he will vacate the dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.698" offset="8646740">The absence of the word "willfulness" from the word "fail" in Rule 41 (b) is not going to change the inherent moral requirements that there shall be some kind of deliberate action or its equivalent wanting this or something of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.080" offset="8712255">So one cannot flee from 37 to 41 to inherit power and get away from the inherent proposition here that there must be willfulness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.668" offset="8758648">Now, I was interested in an opinion that was rendered by the Eighth Circuit in the case in which they made a quick distinction between two cases which I'm going to discuss.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.375" offset="8809430">I'm talking about the Hovey against Elliott case decided by this Court in 167 U.S. and Hammond Packing Company against Arkansas in 212 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.740" offset="8854883">Written 12 years apart by the late Chief Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.646" offset="8874527">In the Hovey case, one of the parties was ordered to pay money over to the other party which was in a semi-custodial allegiance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.310" offset="8921234">The party willfully refused to pay the money over and the Court struck his answer from the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.093" offset="8956343">And this Court held that that wasn't unconstitutional deprivation of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.334" offset="8981316">This Court said that that was punishment and punishment may not be imposed so as to deprive a litigant of his day in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.370" offset="9029381">They could have fined Elliott in Hovey against Elliott.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.758" offset="9051011">They could have sent him to jail perhaps but they could not strike his answer because that -- that deprives him in his day in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.940" offset="9091657">Now 12 years later in Hammond Packing Company against Arkansas, the question came up of an Arkansas antitrust statute which provided in Section 8 for discovery and which provide in Section 9 for striking the answer of the respondent if he disobeyed the discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.781" offset="9171069">Hammond Packing said they thought the law was invalid and they refused to make discovery and the answer was struck and that case came to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.686" offset="9210671">And that case came to this Court on the basis of Hovey against Elliott saying that this was punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.724" offset="9250795">This Court said that's not punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.370" offset="9265424">This time we deal with presumptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.419" offset="9289665">We pass upon the merits in effect of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.531" offset="9306070">We do not strike the answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.304" offset="9313176">The answer was not struck because of punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.908" offset="9323624">The Court went on to say that a bona fide effort to comply and inability to comply would exonerate the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.362" offset="9369391">And therefore he had nothing to worry about it and the sanctions of the statute could not be imposed in that kind of a situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.899" offset="9403559">But if he deliberately refused then what the law does is to raise a presumption that he hasn't got a good defense, a presumption of the untruthfulness of his defense and in striking the answer under those conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.426" offset="9481613">He's had his day in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.402" offset="9489554">It's the same as sustaining a demurrer to an -- to a declaration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.567" offset="9514214">It's the same as sustaining a motion for a directed verdict at the end of the plaintiff's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.243" offset="9536888">The presumption which this Court recognized and espoused in Hammond Packing Company against Arkansas was to the effect that a man who willfully disobeys in that situation, it must be because he has it in the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.443" offset="9617763">It's something like flight in a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.268" offset="9629048">It's those reasonable inferences that can be drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.189" offset="9640751">And the striking of the answer there was held not to be punishment but to be a perfectly valid disposition of that case having met the requirements of due process by having given that defendant his day in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.384" offset="9697489">Now, that's our situation.We stand before the bar of this Court completely innocent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.265" offset="9724970">We have been held by the -- all the lower courts to be free from guilt in this connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.353" offset="9765407">It has been determined that we were in good faith, that we were incapable of producing these records and I remind the Court what I said a few moments ago, which is to the effect that when the judge finally dismissed us in this case, he did so because he said, ‚ÄúI might as well bring this thing to an end.‚Äù</text>

            <text syncTime="2822.663" offset="11290645">Before going further, I'd like to call the attention of the Court to the fact that the interveners involved in the Kaufman case are expressly not covered by this order that is Judge Laws expressly provided that this order of dismissal would not affect the interveners who are not in custody or control of these records.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.603" offset="11394403">Secondly, I think that we need some more facts in order to be able to examine the problems in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.210" offset="11436826">We start off with the proposition first that there is no question, there is no debate about the proposition that these concerns were with -- were controlled by Germans, by I.G. Farben up to 1940.</text>

            <text syncTime="2917.450" offset="11669734">As one of the directors of the petitioner, Chemie, and then there was Gadow, who was the director of the petitioner, Chemie.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.041" offset="11716127">And Gadow was the brother-in-law of Hermann Schmitz, the Chairman of the Board of I.G. Farben.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.627" offset="11750504">And the set up was that Gadow or Sturzenegger and one other signature, either Gadow and Sturzenegger together or Greutert, his predecessor or Sturzenegger and one of his clerks could always bind the petitioner as to any action on behalf of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.972" offset="11851860">Now until 1936, this bank which was just a small private bank only had 50 to 100 customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.642" offset="11898567">And all of these customers, mind you, all of them were I.G. Farben connected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.254" offset="11920927">They were either I.G. Farben or they were connected with I.G. Farben.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.417" offset="11941616">So I want you to see the picture here of the interlocking of this private bank that's used in all of these transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.134" offset="11984457">And the petitioner and why these courts in examining this matter over a period of almost 10 years now saw fit to say that you can't come into court in this country and try out this case without producing all of the records that will show the enemy taint that appears in this picture.</text>

            <text syncTime="6053.708" offset="24214779">We found that he -- they manufactured their books and they had -- they had record books that clearly showed that when they had the originals they had 13 journals and it showed references back and forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="6070.463" offset="24281757">It's all set out in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="6072.903" offset="24291579">The ones they gave us were only 11 books.</text>
            <text syncTime="6076.910" offset="24307566">And on the cover page, the inside cover page of each one of these journals, it says the date -- that the stationer delivered the book to the petitioner and the date of the delivery is anywhere from one month to 22 months after the dates of the entries inside.</text>
            <text syncTime="6098.165" offset="24392620">Then when they delivered the other papers to us there are over 9000 we were able to check on, but they didn't deliver it all.</text>
            <text syncTime="6107.032" offset="24428042">They came up later with some 5000 additional.</text>
            <text syncTime="6111.338" offset="24445283">Now, you -- in this kind of a matter where you're trying to run out cloaking transactions, you're trying to run out items of investment in stocks and bonds over a long period of time from at least 1936 and it goes back at least 1931 on.</text>

            <text syncTime="6132.940" offset="24531696">They even talked about giving us book and they'll blank out the lines they can't get consent to.</text>
            <text syncTime="6139.090" offset="24556356">And if I could do that in any kind of a case and just blank out the lines where the transaction ran back the other way could be absolutely meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="6149.621" offset="24598465">You just can't run out of cloaking transaction in that manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="6153.409" offset="24613616">Now, they suggest to us that we should -- the other thing they suggest is that we have a -- a person that's appointed by the Swiss Government sworn to assist the Swiss secrecy law.He's going to abide by that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6166.956" offset="24667742">He's going to examine these records and then he's going to determine relevancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="6176.032" offset="24704104">Now, just think what that means to American Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6179.896" offset="24719569">Here's a man, a Swiss, he's going to determine relevancy for an American Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6185.097" offset="24740362">And If I could determine relevancy, I don't think the judicial function would amount too much for the Court but he is going to decide that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6193.113" offset="24772441">And then we're going to try according to plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="6196.634" offset="24786442">We'll go into the Court and see if by letters rogatory we can force them to give these up in spite of the Swiss laws and we'll see how many we get and then we run down the various transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6210.465" offset="24841822">And of course, if anybody is going to give us manufactured books because there isn't any question for what we have here, we're not going to get the key transactions that tell what they did in the cloaking.</text>

            <text syncTime="6720.052" offset="26880104">My greatly respected friend here, the Solicitor General, has naturally had to absorb a very large record in a very short time.</text>
            <text syncTime="6730.311" offset="26921169">And I mean no reflection upon him when I criticize some of his allusions to the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="6737.437" offset="26949695">I do not have to remind the Court there's been no trial here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6742.081" offset="26968294">I do not have to remind the Court that there's been no findings of enemy taint.</text>
            <text syncTime="6748.705" offset="26994730">But I would like to remind the Court that I disagree with many of the factual statements that the Solicitor General had said.</text>
            <text syncTime="6756.853" offset="27027331">And believe me when I say it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6758.565" offset="27034227">I suggest nothing but pressure time it is (Inaudible).He speaks about the communications from the Farben to the Financial Ministry of Germany as evidence in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6771.427" offset="27085636">I want to remind the Court that the reason that's in this record is that when Sturzenegger was on the stand, he was showing one of those documents which our Government had gotten out of Germany after the fall of Germany.</text>
            <text syncTime="6786.509" offset="27146031">And he was asked if he could identify it and he said that he couldn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="6791.667" offset="27166616">And I say to the Court that there is printed in this record literally hundreds of pieces of materials that are no proof of anything in this case, that have not been offered in evidence, that have not even been identified by the witness who was shown here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6806.023" offset="27224085">And I've given you some examples of it at the bottom of page 7 in foot -- 7 (a) of our appendix of a footnote to our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="6817.016" offset="27267971">Now in the Appendix of 7 (a), I could stand here for hours if the time permitted and the Court permitted to demonstrate that most of what the Solicitor General has offered here as enemy taint has not been established.</text>
            <text syncTime="6833.035" offset="27332127">Why I was -- I was astounded to hear him say that our client was German up to 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="6840.380" offset="27361489">There isn't a word of truth in support of that statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="6843.831" offset="27375282">The only event that happened in 1940 was that there was a cancellation of a contractual relationship between Farben and the plaintiff having to deal with reciprocal rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="6854.997" offset="27419899">Farben had an option to acquire the investments of Chemie in exchange for which Chemie was guaranteed by Chemie's stockholders, they are guaranteed by Chemie, the same dividend rate as Farben was.</text>
            <text syncTime="6872.502" offset="27489907">But it was not the question of Chemie being German until 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="6878.448" offset="27513731">I don't deny for one moment that the inception of Chemie in this case was largely German.</text>
            <text syncTime="6886.181" offset="27544660">What the admitted evidence in this case and by that I mean the deposition, the credible depositions that are not in dispute show the evolution of the Swiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="6897.479" offset="27589904">And then as the years went by, they began to throw off this German (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="6903.651" offset="27614563">And long before 1940, this corporation seized to be controlled by the Germans.</text>
            <text syncTime="6910.997" offset="27643925">And the single event that occurred in 1940, which the Solicitor General points to as a date when they seized to be German was only this dividend guarantee contract that I spoke to you about.</text>
            <text syncTime="6927.660" offset="27710589">About the books, the duplicate set of books, Mr. Justice Brennan, about the 9000 missing records that issue is yet unresolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="6942.012" offset="27767954">What happened was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6945.898" offset="27783523">With the Justice Department took the position that the plaintiff had failed to produce these proper books and some 9000 documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="6956.240" offset="27824901">They didn't move to dismiss which always surprised me.</text>
            <text syncTime="6958.860" offset="27835350">I never knew -- I wonder why they didn't at that time move to strike this down for some kind of a simple act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6966.507" offset="27865966">They moved for a second discovery order against Interhandel, Chemie, the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="6974.527" offset="27898044">And at that time, we were fighting over whether this was a duplicate set of books and we were fighting over whether there were 9000 documents missing when Judge Laws issued his decision of February 19, 1923.</text>
            <text syncTime="6993.430" offset="27973695">At that point, I moved that we stay everything until we get through this main battle.</text>
            <text syncTime="7000.906" offset="28003579">Now, we've never gotten back on that fight.</text>
            <text syncTime="7003.598" offset="28014341">We don't concede there's any duplicate set of books here.</text>
            <text syncTime="7008.261" offset="28032940">With regard to the 9000 records that we -- that is claimed that we withheld, we went back and looked again.</text>
            <text syncTime="7014.914" offset="28059585">Mind you, if the Court please, we produced 41,000 documents, 70,000 microfilms were taken of our client's records.</text>
            <text syncTime="7026.364" offset="28105456">Isn't there a margin for error there that's possible that it won't be denominated bad faith of crookedness?</text>
            <text syncTime="7034.271" offset="28137012">We went back when we said that we had given them 9000 documents and we began to dig.</text>
            <text syncTime="7040.369" offset="28161463">And what did we find?</text>
            <text syncTime="7042.111" offset="28168359">We found that other 9000, some 5000 were second and third and fourth carbons of documents of which they've gotten the first carbon already.</text>
            <text syncTime="7054.654" offset="28218514">And we were in the middle of explaining the absence of the other 4000, some of which we were producing piecemeal when that proceeding was stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="7063.912" offset="28255608">I submit the Solicitor General has no right to mention that matter to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7069.487" offset="28277864">That matter is in the lap of the District Court for decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="7075.086" offset="28300330">Now, if I have several moments later -- left, I would like to return to the observations of Mr. Justice Frankfurter when he posed two complementary observations.</text>
            <text syncTime="7090.124" offset="28360411">One was with respect to the national being responsible for the conduct of its nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="7099.105" offset="28396356">That's -- that problem is -- that question is in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7105.765" offset="28423001">I wouldn't be fair with the Court if I didn't face up to its existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="7112.182" offset="28448705">What we have on the one hand, no charge that the Government of Switzerland has acted in bad faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="7119.611" offset="28478380">And we have on the other hand, no proof that the petitioner has acted in bad faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="7126.773" offset="28507011">And we've searched the authorities and I'm sure that our respondent's have searched the authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="7133.278" offset="28533029">And there isn't a case that we found in the books wherein peacetime.</text>
            <text syncTime="7140.782" offset="28563122">In the course of Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence, a national in a transaction of this sort would be responsible for the conduct of its nation.</text>
