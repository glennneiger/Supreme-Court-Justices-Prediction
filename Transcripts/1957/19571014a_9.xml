            <text syncTime="256.466" offset="1025776">We contend in this Court that Lawn had no prima facie connection whatever with any conspiracy and that in addition to that there was an egregious trespass on Lawn's rights both by the manner of this prosecution and by the fact that his motion was not granted to dismiss him from the case and I will develop those points.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.111" offset="1152418">Lawn was accused here of aiding his principals, two principals to evade their tax obligations by non-payment of their tax debts and to orient the charge against Lawn let me say, Mr. Lawn is not here as a taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.336" offset="1221277">He didn't aid or counsel the taxpayers on their reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.160" offset="1236637">He didn't file any reports for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.124" offset="1248444">He was an employee in an enterprise that sought to develop sugar out of waste material, almost like developing gold out of sea water, but they thought that they were going to be able to accomplish this.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.749" offset="1314900">And he was engaged to head up the import export trade and the research and development of that project and enormous sums went into that project.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.284" offset="1365055">Lawn was trained as a lawyer and I think it is very important at the outset of the augment to spike any notion that Lawn appeared in this prosecution in the slightest degree at any page of each and every one of these references, that I make in the record that Lawn appeared in any professional capacity in any transaction or action.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.999" offset="1463902">He did not in any time function at any matter as a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.806" offset="1487203">His co-defendants were advised by top notch attorneys in their fields and tax experts even for the simplest transaction and because the government has made some point of this in my reply brief, Your Honors will find at page 22 the list of the activities involving lawyers and the identification, and name, and record reference of every lawyer who had anything whatever to do on a legal level with this man.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.398" offset="1597544">The government conceded in this case that the counts against Lawn and there are three out of the ten, two -- counts seven and nine under conspiracy count are positive on the premise that the tax returns of Lawn's principals, the tax returns of Lawn's principals not his tax returns because they are not involved here, were proper and properly filed, but that non payment of taxes was the basis of the crime which Lawn allegedly aided.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.531" offset="1742054">Lawn had no personal stake or interest in whether or not these people paid their taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.075" offset="1768281">He had no obligation to see that they did pay their taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.955" offset="1783745">He had no personal advantage accruing to him if they didn't or if they (Inaudible) payment of their taxes and there is no proof whatsoever and I confidently state that and stated it in my main brief and requested the solicitor general and the attorney below to point to any court reference in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.094" offset="1872353">There is no proof whatsoever that Lawn knew -- that there is nothing to show that Lawn knew that there was a tax due from anyone of these principals.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.233" offset="1912895">There is nothing to show that Lawn knew that the tax was unpaid, and there is nothing to show that Lawn knew that there was an intent not to pay it.</text>

            <text syncTime="674.083" offset="2696255">After the 1950 indictment, 1952 indictments were dismissed, the government proceeded to obtain a sealed indictment which for a practical purposes parallels the 1952 indictment and they kept that sealed while they were taking an appeal to the Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit, and they also kept the records that had been ordered to be returned as a stay order, but they had those records while that Grand Jury was operating in 1953 to indict these people on the same counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.041" offset="2832091">And then when their appeal was dismissed because it wasn't timely taken, the government hadn't perfected its appeal timely and the decision became final.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.425" offset="2877649">The indictment was open, but the records were still not returned in 1954 on an application to another district judge, Judge Palmieri, then seeking to go into the question as to whether any of this illegal outlawed evidence had been used in the 1953 Grand Jury proceedings, which failed because Judge Palmieri did not permit them to go into what had been used, open up -- to create that 1953 indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.931" offset="3007634">Judge Palmieri nevertheless said they are entitled to their record back, I order you to return their personal records, and yet we know in this case, through what the Solicitor now says was an inadvertent mistake of the prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.098" offset="3076389">That one of the key papers, a $15,000 check which was the only conceivable link that the government had to link Lawn to crime, and was spelled out its thesis for the purposes of the jury, that he had participated in fruits and therefore must have been part of a conspiracy, that $15,000 check was not returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.165" offset="3196656">Judge Palmieri refused to permit an investigation into the 1953 Grand Jury proceedings because he had received vouchers in the form of affidavits, seven of them, from the prosecutors saying, we didn't use any tainted evidence, we promise not to use any tainted evidence and the tainted evidence won't be used on the trial and Judge Palmieri said in the face of those representations, I leave it to the trial and if there is any use on the trial that you can take that up with the trial judge.</text>

            <text syncTime="947.454" offset="3789740">Mr. Wessel, the prosecutor says this affidavit is submitted to the Court together with other affidavits attached hereto to certify the record, that the assurances made by the government in connection with the use of certain documents have been fully carried out, paragraph two.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.289" offset="3849091">Paragraph five; throughout the trial of this case I carefully analyzed everything, I underscore everything, item of evidence used by the government and I'm certain that none, none he said of the described material was used in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.462" offset="3921816">None of the questioned evidence was used as direct evidence and cross examination to refresh a witness' recollection in preparation for or during the trial as a lead to evidence, or in any other manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.058" offset="3972180">And if Your Honors so desire, I can supply you the page references to 27 such affidavits filed and six express statements, one coming as late as a time when just before thee people were sentenced, in a burst of propriety, the prosecutor again at one -- on page 2083, I would like to state again if Your Honor please positively, finally, affirmatively, I will do it under oath any way that I possibly can that I am positive that there has been nothing in this case from the trial before the Grand Jury that in any way comes from those categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.849" offset="4155350">These lowing reassurances of course must have had some kind of an impact of the Court and they certainly do on Mr. Stryker, but they turned out as the Solicitor now says to be an inadvertent mistake with the piece of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.668" offset="4218671">The inadvertence was about the one thing that affected Lawn, because when he appeared before that Grand Jury that Judge Goddard said had no business to hold him before the Grand Jury, he produced four pieces of paper, one of them was this check, the second one was the stub end piece from which the check was made and then two other checks, but this one check was drawn to Howard Lawn and endorsed by Howard Lawn and show that Howard Lawn had gotten $15,000 on November 7, 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.362" offset="4337371">He didn't take the stand to testify to what their transaction was, but the prosecutors used that very effectively by showing this was -- he must have been doing something as Your Honors will see he said, what did he get the money for?</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.028" offset="4392020">It wasn't his salary which he was getting separately (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.420" offset="4413649">Lawn was the forgotten man during this trial as attested by the schedule to my brief and the sporadic references in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.188" offset="4444682">And when the time came for the summation, the prosecutor was visibly touched by Mr. Stryker's demonstration of the hole in the government's case, and the unreliability of the tales of admitted perjurers and criminals who testified for the government and he was impelled to bolster the government case by giving his unsworn testimony to the jury, by announcing that he was scarping his original plan of summation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.454" offset="4553770">He was touched to acquit as a trial lawyer and then he proceeded for testify to the jury by the means of the summation and that took two forms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.148" offset="4596506">Number one, he vouched for the truth of the tale of Roth and Lubben and told the jury that they were telling the true, and number two he induced prejudice against the petitioner Lawn by ascribing a host of collateral crimes or misconduct, not material and not shown by any of the evidence, but it was his witnesses who had been in that category so he thought it was desirable to accuse Mr. Lawn likewise, so what did he do?</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.070" offset="4720222">This was a tax, aiding a tax conspiracy, so Lawn found himself on the summation at the end of a seven weeks trials without any evidence in the record or material for the trial being accused on summation of fixing, bribery, fraud, personal tax evasion, forgery; and yet the charge here was that these tax principals hadn't paid their taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.861" offset="4827429">Not satisfied that he had done well enough, he told the jury that if they couldn't swallow the tales of Roth and Lubben these two key witnesses on whom the government depended for a convictions here, they told the jury, but don't forget you can't deny the $15,000 check.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.472" offset="4893884">No matter what you think of their testimony he argued the summation, you can't deny the (Inaudible) evidence and here is the $15,000 check, but that was outlawed proof, and that found at record 2604 in the summation.</text>

            <text syncTime="5179.196" offset="20716774">Neither, neither court ruled -- neither Judge Goddard nor Judge Palmieri ruled these documents were privileged.</text>
            <text syncTime="5186.286" offset="20745091">The res judicata did not hold, as I discussed before, the privilege applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="5191.162" offset="20764630">Now our second independent ground is waiver at the trial when Mr. Stryker examined the documents for (Inaudible) more in the record, asked 10 questions about the details of the handwriting and made no objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="5207.937" offset="20831713">Now this was a photostatic copy of the check, these documents, the check and stub, passed the document that Lawn had produced before the 1952 Grand Jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="5218.209" offset="20872777">This check as Mr. Pollack has said, the large check, the only large check involved in this case is Lawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="5224.371" offset="20897437">Now certainly his counsel and petitioner knew what was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5229.093" offset="20916349">It's inconceivable that they were taken by the surprise or didn't realize this is the same check that they have produced in the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5235.675" offset="20942681">Only conceivable thing is they decided not to make any objection or I think the worst which I would not suggest some other lawyer in the same position might have said, let's see this go in the record and we'll have an appeal of the point later on.</text>
            <text syncTime="5267.584" offset="21070263">We believe that neither party to dispose that covered by the affidavit, covered by the order before.</text>
            <text syncTime="5275.766" offset="21102968">Both the government and Lawn knew this check had been delivered to the government before, both of them knew the government had copies of this which Lawn had delivered and neither party ever considered this photostat (Inaudible) as being one of the tainted document that's what got in a wrong briefcase as Mr. Pollack says.</text>
            <text syncTime="5297.781" offset="21191053">I'd say, that's the implicit fact of – in fact both prosecutor making these affidavit, introduces, Mr. Stryker continually to objecting to any possibility of tainted evidence wants the check go in, the important check.</text>
            <text syncTime="5310.311" offset="21241208">Neither of them ever considered that to have been covered by the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5314.012" offset="21256046">It's only after new counsel hired, retained after the case is in the Court of Appeals who would then go on in the assumption that every copy of this check, this particular photostatic copy was, was covered by the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="5326.725" offset="21306828">Our third ground is that did not find the memorandum requested by the Trial Court, specifically memorandum to show any exhibit that could have come from the tainted document, petitioner waived any objection which were necessarily had been raised by that memorandum.</text>
            <text syncTime="5342.933" offset="21371716">He could not have complied the District Court's requests, repeated requests, three or four times the District Court said, will you give me a memorandum, when he is going through the record any item that could have been obtained, defense counsel did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="5356.656" offset="21426573">Now they could not have gone through it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5357.764" offset="21430962">They have check in one hand Exhibit 61(a) here not even suggested the possibility, that this exhibit might have come from that check is a photostatic copy, they had one in one hand, and one in the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="5368.682" offset="21474638">And the judge asked him repeatedly to suggest any evidence that could have been tainted, any compliance with that request could have produced the objection or given us the opportunity of the District Court to tell this document did not privileged and (Inaudible)</text>
