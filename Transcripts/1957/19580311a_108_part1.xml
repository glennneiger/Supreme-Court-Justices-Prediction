            <text syncTime="46.768" offset="187037">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.933" offset="203651">Four out of this five cases involved oil and gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.928" offset="219638">The Weed case involves sulphur since both of these are natural.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice William O. Douglas</label>
            <text syncTime="58.948" offset="235729">You said sulphur?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_n_stull" startTime="59.736" stopTime="336.310">
            <label>Mr. John N. Stull</label>
            <text syncTime="59.736" offset="238864">Sulphur, yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.521" offset="246073">Since both of these are natural resources, we don't see any valid distinction for the purposes of the question involved in this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.976" offset="275853">So, I'd rather for simplicity, just refer to oil and gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.164" offset="292571">All five of these cases involved the same fundamental problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.123" offset="312424">That is where an oil payment is carved out of a larger interest are the proceeds from the assignment of that oil payment entitled to the sharply preferential tax treatment accorded to capital gains by Section 117 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 or are they as the Government contends, merely a substitute for and paid in lieu of the ordinary income which would have been payable in -- on these interests that this assignment not been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.820" offset="459233">The Fleming case involves a subsidiary question which I'd like to put of until last.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.124" offset="484415">Now, Section 117 of the Internal Revenue Code which has been before this Court many times gives us preferential treatment to the taxation of the proceeds from the sale or exchange of capital assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.004" offset="540003">Capital assets are defined as all property of the taxpayer with certain specific instruction -- certain specific exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.819" offset="579187">We are not going to any specific exception on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.115" offset="596428">What we are saying is that as this Court has pointed out from Burnet against Harmel in 1932 to the Corn Products case in 1955 that all property that does not come within the specific exception, still does not qualify for capital gains.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.535" offset="682109">The congressional purpose on it was to exclude from these burdens of the surcharge, the proceeds from the conversion of capital asset property.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.669" offset="730593">Any other transaction does not fall within the capital gains provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.795" offset="767164">Now, we are concerned here with an oil payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.778" offset="779076">It's also called an in-oil payment, a production payment, a mineral payment and sometimes unlimited royalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.250" offset="812931">The definition of it is that it is a right of limited duration, carved out of the larger interest to a specified sum of money or specified number of barrels of oil payable out of the stipulated portion of the oil or the oil proceeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.712" offset="886805">Now, that's a complicated definition and in order to put this transaction in its proper perspective, I would like to spend just a moment in describing very briefly the method by which oil properties are developed in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.714" offset="950753">We start off with the lease owner -- with the land owner who owns the minerals under the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.372" offset="973427">He executes a lease and he retains an interest in the production of those minerals for the duration of a lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.961" offset="1003833">It's usually an eighth interest and it's called a royalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.637" offset="1018462">The seven-eighths interest which is attained by the lessee is called the working interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.043" offset="1040091">That has all the burdens of production, operation of the lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.035" offset="1056078">If this is a particular attractive lease, there maybe a cash payment laid by the lessee to the lessor that is called bonus.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.920" offset="1091605">If the lessee cannot develop the property or is unwilling to and doesn't want the lease to expire, he may form it out by a formal agreement which is in effect a sublease.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.375" offset="1137476">If he retains an interest in that property which he does in the case of a sublease, it's called an overriding royalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.327" offset="1165270">So, we're concerned here with terms such as royalty, overriding royalty, working interest and cash bonus.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.903" offset="1199543">Now, I'd like to give an illustration of how an oil payment works.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.970" offset="1219814">Suppose I own an eighth royalty, the oil applicable to that royalty, I can tell pretty well is -- will be 1000 barrels.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.407" offset="1261610">The whole deposit is about 8000 barrels in the ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.938" offset="1283657">Now, I know that the amount received for that will vary somewhat with the price of oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.660" offset="1302570">The price of oil in these taxes at the moment is about -- the well had is about $3 a barrel.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.116" offset="1324408">So, I can be pretty sure that I have about $3000 worth of oil in the ground.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="336.310" stopTime="338.439">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="336.310" offset="1345202">How do you know that?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_n_stull" startTime="338.439" stopTime="518.535">
            <label>Mr. John N. Stull</label>
            <text syncTime="338.439" offset="1353665">The engineering surveys and can tell pretty accurately how much the recoverable reserves are, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.572" offset="1378220">And with the price of oil, I can look back for the past 20 years and see that if it has been increasing along with prices generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.099" offset="1408313">At the time of the sewers crisis, of course the price of oil goes up and at this moment I understand, it's a little bit off.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.620" offset="1430465">It's down to about $3 or $7.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.250" offset="1440914">So, I can pretty well tell how much my oil is worth on the ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.887" offset="1459513">I do -- I would have a little trouble perhaps in telling you exactly how long it will take to profit, because the Regulatory Commission such as the Texas Railroad Commission, set the allowable which now that oil has somewhat dwell on the market or down to 9 or 10 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.903" offset="1527536">They have been up as high as 20, but I can tell by looking back over a period of years that the chances are that this oil will be pumped out of here in 10 years, which means I would make -- I would have a hundred barrels of oil every year for 10 years on which I would receive $300 from the pipeline company that purchases the oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.107" offset="1624398">That $300 that comes in every year will be taxed to me as ordinary income, subject of course to the depletion allowance.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.237" offset="1660865">The percentage depletion allowance on oil is 27.5%.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.441" offset="1677688">That means that every $100 I get from the pipeline company, I will exclude $27.50 for my income before I put it in my return and pay the tax on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.662" offset="1722619">Sulphur has a depletion allowance of only 23%.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.274" offset="1745084">Now, I might say that this production of the oil since this is my investment, is a capital gains transaction that every time I sell a barrel of oil, it's a capital gain to me, but this Court decided in 1932 that that just wasn't so because the production of oil is like a business.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.020" offset="1840065">It's like a manufacturing business and you get your basics back through the depletion.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.161" offset="1864620">Now, suppose I'm not satisfied with this percentage depletion that I'm getting each year, what I want is a capital gain because I have to save more taxes on a capital gain than I can through percentage depletion.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.112" offset="1912372">So, what can I do?I got this royalty interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.616" offset="1922403">I know it's going to produce $300 a year to me for probably the next 10 years, at least.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.720" offset="1946854">Well, I can sell my entire interest and if I'm not a dealer, that is if I'm not in a business of selling interest in oil and gas, I can get a capital gain on that, but I don't want to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.961" offset="1999830">I don't want to get out of this thing completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.370" offset="2009443">What I want to do is stay in.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.306" offset="2021146">The reason I want to stay in is because of course every year, the engineers are getting better and getting more oil out of these deposits, so they use gas injection, water flooding and all the other things.</text>
