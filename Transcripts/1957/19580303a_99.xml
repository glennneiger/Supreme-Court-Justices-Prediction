            <label>Mr. Wiley A. Branton</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">-- The Supreme Court of the State of Arkansas, the defendant Frank Andrew Payne is or rather was at the time of the alleged commission of the crime a 19-year-old Negro youth, was tried for a charge of murder in the first degree in the Circuit Court of Jefferson County, Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.105" offset="68336">He was convicted of that crime in Jefferson County, took an appeal to the Supreme Court of Arkansas where the conviction was affirmed and this Court has granted certiorari to the petitioner to hear or to determine two points raised in the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.821" offset="135210">One, whether or not members of the Negro race were systematically excluded or their number limited in the selection of the jury panel and of the jury commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.699" offset="170736">And two whether the petitioner's alleged confession was introduced into evidence after the same had been illegally and unlawfully secured from him.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.653" offset="206576">I should like to argue those two points in the order of that certiorari was granted, namely beginning with the filing of our motion to quash the then panel on the grounds of racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.732" offset="262896">In order to fully appreciate the motion which was filed in the lower court, it should be pointed out that the petitioner in this case is a Negro, that he was charged with the slaying of an elderly white man and that he was tried before an all white jury in Jefferson County, Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.058" offset="336144">The population of Jefferson County according to the 1950 census is 76,075 of which 37,835 or approximately 50% of the total population is composed of colored people.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.162" offset="404584">The jury panel is selected from qualified electors within the county pursuant to Arkansas law.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.285" offset="433110">And at the time of the trial on the lower court there were 19,452 qualified voters in Jefferson County, of which 5774 or 30% were Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.821" offset="499252">The petitioner in proper time prior to the hearing of the case on the merits filed a motion seeking to quash the jury panel on the grounds, one, that for more than 50 years in Jefferson County, Arkansas no Negro had ever been appointed to the three-man jury commission which is charged with responsibility of selecting persons to serve on the jury panel in Jefferson County.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.593" offset="598309">And two, that of the persons selected for jury service, that the jury commission was acting in a manner so as to have and inapportioned limiting of the number of Negroes called for jury service in Jefferson County.</text>

            <text syncTime="268.534" offset="1074051">This three-man jury commission was appointed by the court a few days prior to each term of court, and there has never been a Negro serving as a jury commissioner in the history of anybody who we were able to get to testify who had any knowledge on it at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="298.197" offset="1192751">And as early as Strauder versus West Virginia this Court said that the constitution of juries is a very essential part of the protection such of mode of trial is intended to secure.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.912" offset="1235592">We have no case law at all to support our argument, other than to say a fortiori that we contend that such reasoning should also apply to the three-man jury commission which selects the people to serve on the jury panel in the first place, and that the appointment of this three-man jury commission at each term of court is such an integral part of the selection of jurors, that if there has been racial discrimination in the selection of persons to serve on this commission in the first place that that is just as unconstitutional as discrimination by race for serving on either a petit or grand jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="473.524" offset="1894087">Now, the second reason for the filing of our motion to quash the panel, aside from the fact that no Negroes have ever been appointed to the jury commission, the fact that we contend that there has been an arbitrary and an inapportioned limiting of the number of Negroes serving on the petit jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.543" offset="1962109">Now, prior to 1947 no Negro had ever served on a jury in Jefferson County for more than 50 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.438" offset="1989695">And in the March 1947 term of Jefferson Circuit Court, in a case then pending, the defense attorney filed a motion to quash the then panel on the grounds that there had been systematic exclusion of Negroes from jury service in that county.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.471" offset="2045806">That motion was granted and the jury commission was directed to select a new panel and on that panel there were some 13 or more Negroes appointed on the panel.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.240" offset="2100872">But beginning with the next term of court which was the October term of 1947, down to and including the October term of 1955, on page 25 of the petitioner's brief we set forth there the total number of persons selected on the panel and off to the right we have the total number of Negroes who have been placed on that panel.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.579" offset="2218214">If you will note there, the number of Negroes who have been called for jury service not for one term of court, but for 17 consecutive terms of court from October of 1947 down to October of 1955, you have only had a total of 29 Negroes called for jury service out a total of 669 jurors which constitutes only four and three-tenths percent of the number of persons called for jury service.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.844" offset="2347363">If you will note there it seems to follow a rather definite pattern of limiting the number of Negroes on the panel to just to two or three Negroes per panel.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.420" offset="2389577">And of course that means that in, not only in a capital case but even in a misdemeanor, unless there happens to be a Negro on that panel who satisfies the prosecuting attorneys, then it means that the state has more peremptory challenges authorized by law, so that they can exclude all of the Negroes on the panel so that in practical effect no Negro can actually serve on a jury unless it meets with the approval of the prosecuting attorney in that case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Wiley A. Branton</label>
            <text syncTime="6887.664" offset="27550616">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6888.925" offset="27555631">I noticed that there has been considerable questioning back and forth as to what the Chief of Police meant about whether or not there were 30 or 40 people downstairs just prior to the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="6899.313" offset="27597218">I wish to point out to the Court that on bottom of page 113 on cross-examination of the Chief of Police by myself, I specifically asked him this question, “State whether or not anything was said to the defendant to the effect that there would be 30 or 40 people there in a few minutes that wanted to get him?</text>
            <text syncTime="6918.519" offset="27674018">His answer was, “I told him that would be possible, that would be that many.</text>
            <text syncTime="6924.130" offset="27696483">It was possible there could be that many.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6926.856" offset="27707350">I think that clears up what the Chief of Police meant because certainly the question was, “Did you tell him that there'd be that many people there to get him.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6934.931" offset="27739638">Now the State contends what he meant was, there'd be 30 or 40 people there to witness the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="6940.321" offset="27761267">And certainly to use the language to get him, it can't mean but one thing namely just what it implied that there would be possible mob violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="6949.862" offset="27799406">The defendant specifically repudiates his confession on page 94.</text>
            <text syncTime="6955.126" offset="27820408">It does not appear in the transcript of record printed here as to the defense on the merits for the simple reason that the only part of the record here is that part designated by the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="6967.257" offset="27868996">Naturally, the petitioner was only going to designate that part that this Court would consider on certiorari, we didn't feel that we should make our state's case, they failed to cross designate, it's not here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6978.800" offset="27915180">The defendant took the witness stand on his own behalf admitted to the slaying, but states that he was working there, that he and his employer got into a very heated argument that the employer slapped him and that he reached down, passed an iron bar, and that he jumped over this counter, that they fought over, he got it away from him and beat him with an iron bar and when he realized what he had done that his first thought was to get away and the man was there checking up and he took some money.</text>
            <text syncTime="7005.162" offset="28020611">Now it should be remembered that this defendant was not charged with a crime of murder in the first degree while in the perpetration of a felony, because the State would have had -- would have had an easier case in the Arkansas law, no premeditation being required.</text>
            <text syncTime="7019.430" offset="28077662">Now, they're trying to imply here that he was charged with robbing the man.</text>
            <text syncTime="7022.939" offset="28091664">But he wasn't even charged with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="7025.303" offset="28101172">It's true that he had 400 some odd dollars but he was never charged with a slaying while the perpetration of a felony.</text>

            <text syncTime="7104.965" offset="28419762">And therefore in answer to a question as to the number of Negroes who served the preceding year, one commissioner said that he couldn't use all of those who had been used a year before.</text>
            <text syncTime="7116.038" offset="28464065">The record shows that only two or perhaps four had been used a year before.</text>
            <text syncTime="7120.400" offset="28481515">Anybody who had been excused would not be on the payroll record and therefore could be used on the next panel.</text>
            <text syncTime="7128.154" offset="28512549">The testimony as to that payroll record is uncontradicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="7133.908" offset="28535536">The State says if we don't know how to add and that the total number there is 640, we still get 669.</text>
            <text syncTime="7143.624" offset="28574407">We attempted to put the sheriff on the stand, the record, the permanent record is kept not in the Sheriff's office, but in the office of the circuit clerk the same person who said he had no such record.</text>
            <text syncTime="7157.225" offset="28628846">And the Court didn't even want us to burden the trial because after all we had been in court for half a day and if you take longer than two days in Arkansas to electrocute a Negro, why then, you have an unusually long trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="7170.390" offset="28681509">So we wound up in two days.</text>
            <text syncTime="7172.655" offset="28690599">And the Court didn't want this trial delayed and suggested that I get on the stand and testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="7178.531" offset="28714109">Now we submit that after having been invited to make this testimony and certainly we have the burden, then the burden of rebutting that presumption which we had raised was on the State and they offered no testimony whatsoever to rebut the evidence which we had offered.</text>
            <text syncTime="7198.432" offset="28793626">As to whether or not there were more Negroes excused from jury service as compared with white, the record is silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="7206.014" offset="28824033">As I say, we'd have go outside the record but certainly the percentage of Negroes who served would be even more disparaging if we used the accurate record rather than the payroll record.</text>
            <text syncTime="7219.522" offset="28878054">And even if that was not true there is nothing here that the State says that people get excused for two things, having made this, and this, that and the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="7227.270" offset="28908983">And I don't think that this Court can take any judicial knowledge of the fact or be presumptuous enough to say that Negroes have any more (Inaudible) than white people, that therefore a greater percentage of Negroes would asked to be excused than would white.</text>
            <text syncTime="7240.868" offset="28963422">And as to the inference that might be raised by such a situation as you have in Jefferson County with such a small number of people, being -- Negroes being called for jury service over a long period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="7252.776" offset="29011069">This Court said, in another decision coming out of Texas that it should tax the credulity of the Court, to say that mere chance resulted in such few Negroes being called for jury service in a county, where you have such a high percentage of Negroes making up the population and a high percentage of qualified voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="7270.129" offset="29080451">Another question was directed to the Attorney General as to whether or not in Jefferson County you would find an unusually high percentage of illiterate colored people in that county.</text>
            <text syncTime="7281.326" offset="29125277">Now I've lived in that county all in my life.</text>
            <text syncTime="7284.296" offset="29137084">Insofar as Negroes are concerned, Jefferson County is the leading cultural and educational county of the State of Arkansas for Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="7291.578" offset="29166237">It is the home of the Arkansas State College for Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="7294.550" offset="29178149">It is the home of (Inaudible) Institute for Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="7297.114" offset="29188389">For many, many years the Negro High School has been accredited by the North Central Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="7302.315" offset="29209182">And I dare say that percentage wise there is a greater percentage of literate Negroes in Jefferson County than any other county in the State of Arkansas, and that the literacy qualifications of Negroes is probably equal to or superior percentage wise than the literacy test of white people in that county because there is not a single white college within that county.</text>
            <text syncTime="7325.381" offset="29301447">And certainly anytime that you have a county where you've had a college down through the years, there generally is a higher literacy portion in that particular county than you have in a county where you do not have a college.</text>
