            <text syncTime="69.906" offset="279615">I would merely suggest that if the case is moot, the Court ought to vacate the judgments below and for the reason of mootness.</text>

            <text syncTime="134.943" offset="539690">Our intervention was granted as permissive intervention although we sought it as intervention as of right.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.403" offset="565603">We contend that our interest as a competitor of Transfer would be adversely affected by any judgment which might be secured by Transfer in this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.224" offset="612833">In short, our position is that we have standing under the doctrine of the Frost case.</text>

            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="172.699" offset="690782">Well, it's your judgment to control.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.246" offset="696947">I'm just wondering whether you think it's -- it's a seriously (Inaudible) question as it is and I for once should like to hear.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.940" offset="739683">If you think the Frost case controlled it economically.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="philip_b_kurland" startTime="187.571" stopTime="562.354">
            <label>Mr. Philip B. Kurland</label>
            <text syncTime="187.571" offset="750237">No, I think the Frost case does control it.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.062" offset="772180">There is one other question about the appealability of this case and this is a question whether an appeal rely under Section 1254 (2) from a judgment of a Court of Appeals holding a state statute unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.245" offset="836963">That is whether this is a final judgment for purposes of the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.523" offset="853995">My position maybe stated fairly shortly.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.683" offset="870713">We contend first that 1254 (2) ought not to and it was not intended to impose a final judgment requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.129" offset="912509">This Court has held, I will concede, on two points that a final judgment requirement is in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.459" offset="937796">We set forth in our brief the fact that the Court did so without the benefit of argument of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.067" offset="972173">If it so, first in the Slaker case, shortly after the adoption of the 1925 Judiciary Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.187" offset="1016686">And again, in the South Carolina Electric and Gas Company case relying on the Slaker case, that the Slaker case statement of a requirement for finality was a dictum because as Mr. Justice McReynolds said in rendering the opinion for the Court, the petition -- the petition in the court below contained three counts, none of which questioned the validity of a state statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.643" offset="1114488">He then went on to state in his opinion that the appeal must be one from a final judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.884" offset="1139461">But again in reaching that conclusion, he relied on two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.821" offset="1155239">The first of which was an appeal from the Philippines Supreme Court in which the statute specifically made a requirement of finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.763" offset="1187004">Now, the second was Collins against Miller which was a direct appeal from the -- from a District Court of United States with the statute also that made a specific requirement of finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.478" offset="1233816">Now, the statute in question was adopted on the -- it was -- the section question was inserted in the Florida Senate when the 1925 Act was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.294" offset="1285120">It was adopted from the provision authorizing appeal to this Court from state courts holding a federal statute unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.741" offset="1326916">That provision specifically made a requirement of finality.Despite that, the -- and with this in front of them, the Congress adopted all the -- adopted all the remainder of the language but did not include within this statute any specifications of finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.377" offset="1413433">There is so far as this Court's jurisdiction is concerned as you know no other provision in this -- in the code which requires a final judgment in terms of the Court -- review of the Courts of Appeals whether that review is by way of appeal or by way of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.489" offset="1485949">We suggest that there may be a good reason for that distinction and one of those is that the Court of Appeals does not get jurisdiction in the case until a final judgment has been entered by a District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.752" offset="1558988">I would submit that the type of question which is brought up under 1254 (2) is one of great importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.312" offset="1589185">It involves the relationships of the state and federal government and will not present an issue to the Court until a United States Court of Appeals has first held a state statute unconstitutional that the reason behind this statute is the same as the reason behind the statute authorizing this Court to take jurisdiction by direct appeal in cases where the Federal Government, a statute of Federal Government is held unconstitutional in the Court of Appeals plus the additional factor with delicacy of the relationships between the two jurisdictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.202" offset="1736725">And I would suggest that reading the intent of Congress, reading the purpose behind the Act and recognizing that this case is a comparatively few in number so that they will not likely to be a burden to the Court or that if they were, the Court could dispose them as they did in Slaker in the event of a frivolous appeal by assessing a penalty or by the usual method which it has adopted from time to time and that is by dismissing or rather in this event affirming per curiam.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.014" offset="1867964">I would like to suggest in a minute or two that remains that even if the -- your final judgment requirement is in Section 1254 (2) of the statute, we meet that final judgment requirement in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.087" offset="1920313">The Court has stated a test whether a judgment is final is whether the -- the judgment below had terminated the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.952" offset="1959706">So, if this Court were to affirm, nothing more it needs to be done on the remand and that's exactly the situation that this Court finds that this case is in</text>
            <text syncTime="500.447" offset="2001711">Both parties have agreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.401" offset="2009548">Both parties to this litigation that this judgment disposes of -- the judgment of the Court of Appeals, disposes all the issues between the parties that on remand, nothing would be left to be done in the event of affirmance or indeed in the event of a reversal, except to enter the judgment of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.937" offset="2087706">That being so, we submit that we meet the test which this Court has from time to time suggested as stating the requirement of finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.061" offset="2148206">If I may then in the -- with respect to the contested issues in the case or perhaps before I get to the contested issues, I should say that the -- there are certain concessions of both parties in this lawsuit which eliminate contest.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.659" offset="2226573">The -- should I stop at this point, Your Honor or --</text>
