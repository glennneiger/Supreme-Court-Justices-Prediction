            <text syncTime="11.065" offset="44199">Answering your last question Mr. Justice Brennan, it is our contention that the evidence was not only legally sufficient to sustain the owner's proof and pose upon the defendant according to the standards applied by both this Court and the South Carolina Supreme Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="44.274" offset="177006">For this reason, in respondent's answer, it is alleged that the petitioner's employer of Bouligny Construction Company was operating under the requirements of the South Carolina Workmen's Compensation Act as distinguished from a voluntary election on his part to operate under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.995" offset="263941">And under such circumstances, we submit that Section 72-111 of the South Carolina Workmen's Compensation Act which they seek to invoke now as a basic defense, the petitioner's cause of action, never became operative because the statute was never intended to and never did create any legal liability on the part of the respondent to provide workmen's compensation coverage for the petitioner herein.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.602" offset="394344">The statute was intended to apply only to those circumstances where for the protection of employees who are not otherwise entitled to Workmen's Compensation benefits by law which requires their immediate employers to provide workmen's compensation benefits for them.</text>

            <text syncTime="137.879" offset="551497">And as stated by the South Carolina Supreme Court in the recent case of Adams versus Davison-Paxon Company and I quote from page 12 on -- in petitioner's reply brief, "The courts said that the Act was intended to apply, to extend the benefits of workmen's compensation to workmen who otherwise would not be entitled to that."</text>

            <text syncTime="208.018" offset="832052">The Court stated, "That -- purely a question of law, it must be decided on legal grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.020" offset="860056">Is that what you're moving for?”</text>
            <text syncTime="217.267" offset="869042">My answer was, “That's the first motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.344" offset="881371">And secondly, in the event they allowed to read it, they should read only those portions of the answer which are material and would not permit prejudicial matter to come into the case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="233.175" offset="932676">So we did raise the question in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.757" offset="946991">Moreover, in petitioner's brief, answer in the brief, they stated that the motion was made to amend the answer, to include this affirmative defense some several weeks prior to the trial of this case although this case had been pending for quite sometime and we objected to the amendment of this answer, and stated on page 7 of petitioners brief that the petitioner moved to strike the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.980" offset="1075827">And at -- at approximately the same time the respondent entered a motion to amend the allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.315" offset="1101218">And of course the motion was granted by the District Judge permitting the amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.119" offset="1124415">Although the District Judge didn't dismiss the case on that ground we raised the question in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.107" offset="1156389">We also posed the question to the Court of Appeals and they decided the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.932" offset="1175719">The Court of Appeals decided the question adversely to the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.956" offset="1191811">But we contend, as stated by the South Carolina Supreme Court that this Act was intended to apply only to those workmen who are otherwise entitled to the benefits of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.606" offset="1246354">The -- otherwise, it would be useless to legislation.</text>

            <text syncTime="424.578" offset="1698273">It's cited at the -- the pertinent language is cited on page 12 of the reply brief for petitioner, that's the blue brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.432" offset="1741636">But I submit this, the whole otherwise, this statute, this section would extend the application of the Act beyond its clear and expressed purpose and it would serve not for the protection of the employees but would serve for the protection of owners to the detriment of the employees and would permit owners to absolve themselves from liability because under circumstances where no possible valid reason exist for such immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.729" offset="1894818">We submit on that ground the affirmative defense should have been dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.684" offset="1914671">Now, adverting now to the factual questions in this case for the lack of evidence to support, even the theory of defense pursued by the respondent, it appears that the petitioner brought this action in the District Court of the United States for the Western District of South Carolina against respondent Blue Ridge Rural Electric Cooperative by and CA South Carolina Corporation engaged in the business of supplying electricity to recover damages for its negligence in causing and permitting electric current to run into a substation.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.621" offset="2066390">In the process of construction an uncompleted steel structures, steel and concrete structure, in the process of construction upon which the petitioner Byrd was working, resulting in the lost and amputation of the forearms of the petitioner who incidentally at that time was 24 years of age, married, father of two children, and had an earning capacity of approximately $5000 per year.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.617" offset="2174433">At the time of his injuries, this petitioner was working as an employee of Bouligny Construction Company, an independent contracting construction firm, a cooperation of North Carolina which was engaged on a written contract to construct a large project in South Carolina including the substation involved herein at a cost to respondent of approximately $334,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.417" offset="2289580">And on the project, they employed approximately 50 men.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.286" offset="2321136">And as I've stated, the respondent, several weeks prior to the trial of the case, amended it's affirmative defense to allege that the work of constructing substations being performed by the independent contractor was part of the respondent's business and hence it alleged that under Section 72-111 of the Workmen's Compensation Act Department provision involved herein, the petitioner could have brought an action.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.347" offset="2453316">Under the Compensation Act to recover benefits and therefore his present action at common-law was bought.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.478" offset="2481842">And in order to establish this defense, the respondent sought to establish this defense solely by evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.104" offset="2512353">That is direct employees ordinarily and appropriately performed the work of constructing substations.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.585" offset="2538266">And it sought to establish this evidence by the sole testimony of respondent's manager, A.J. (Inaudible) who on depositions prior to trial professed to have little, if any, knowledge concerning the work performed by the employees of the respondent company or the nature of the work involved in the construction of a substation.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.043" offset="2628127">Notwithstanding, at the trial of his case, he took the stand and testified on direct examination unequivocally that the respondent had six substations and constructed with its own employees and facilities three of the substations and that the last of these three substations was constructed at Liberty, South Carolina three years prior to petitioner's injuries with respondents direct employees and facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.118" offset="2752470">However, the following day when he was recalled to the stand for further cross-examination and confronted with telegraphic -- confronted with telegrams from independent contractors who had actually constructed subs -- the substations which he was talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.114" offset="2840451">He changed, corrected, recanted, and repudiated his testimony of the prior day by stating that the respondent did not construct with its own facilities and employees the substation built at Liberty, South Carolina three years prior for petitioner's injuries and finally admitted that the respondent didn't construct with its own employees and facilities any of its substations.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.165" offset="2948598">Other than this testimony the record is void of evidence that the respondent's direct employees performed such work to support respondent's theory of defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.087" offset="3004291">Moreover, as pointed out by the South Carolina Supreme Court in the case of Miles versus West Virginia Pulp and Paper Company cited in our brief, it is a necessary prerequisite to the application of this section that the subject matter of the work being performed by the independent contractor be owned by the owner at the time of the employee's injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.343" offset="3109303">In the instant case, the record clearly shows that the substation was neither owned, possessed, nor controlled, nor in use, nor in operation as an integral part of respondent's business at the time of the petitioner's injuries.</text>

            <text syncTime="847.295" offset="3389127">We submit therefore that according to our first question involved that the reversal by the court below was clearly erroneous and we rest our contention upon the record in this case and the decision of this Court in Galloway versus United States, 319 U.S. 372 where in this Court at pages 379 and 380, in testing the legal sufficiency of the evidence of a party having the burden of proof, applied the standard of refusing to give legal efficacy or probative value to the testimony of a witness who changes, corrects, recants and repudiates his testimony on the witness stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.805" offset="3571148">A standard which has been followed by the South Carolina Supreme Court in the line of decisions cited in our brief and which had forward spaces that properly and only administration of justice to discourage the giving of false testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.034" offset="3636036">We also rely upon the principle enunciated on a principle flowing from the application of this standard as enunciated by this Court in the Galloway case and I quote, "That mere speculation may not be allowed to do duly for probative facts after making due allowance for all -- all reasonably possible emphasis favoring a party whose case is attacked."</text>
            <text syncTime="934.549" offset="3738122">And judged by the foregoing standard and the principle flowing from the application of this standards, we submit that there's no substantial evidence of record in this case upon which a finding of favor of respondent's affirmative defense can be based upon the theory of the defense pursued by the respondent in the court below.</text>

            <text syncTime="1186.952" offset="4747807">As the Court has seen from the transcript, the respondent here is a Rural Electric Cooperative operating under the laws of the State of South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.556" offset="4798171">It was created by a special statute, the Rural Electric Cooperative Act of South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.380" offset="4825443">And in the course of his business through the years, it entered upon and continued a very large expansion program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.582" offset="4862328">This program went on for years being largely done by its own employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.186" offset="4884689">Upon occasion, the respondent here would contract for a certain work to be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.247" offset="4912901">In 1952, the respondent here led a contract after procuring a loan from the Federal Rule Electrification Administration and this contract contemplated this construction of a body to seven miles of conversion lines and about 24 miles of new lines and also for two substations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.347" offset="5009345">The petitioner here was an employee of the contractor, Bouligny, that is the contractor was his immediate employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.650" offset="5054589">We point out there to the Court that the statute, 72-11 of the South Carolina Code of Laws of 1952 contemplates the letting of work by contract and for that work that is done by contract to be a part of the work of the owner, that is the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.579" offset="5154273">Reading from 72-11 which is on page two of our briefs, it says that in this section and Section 72-113 and 72-114 referred to as owner, “When any person undertake to perform or execute any work which is a part of his trade, business occupation, and contracts with any other person referred to as,” in this section and Section 72-113 to 116, “referred to as subcontractor, for the execution or performance by or under such subcontractor of the whole or any part of the work undertaken by such owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.782" offset="5303066">The owner shall be liable to pay to any workman employed in the work any compensation under this title which he would've been liable to pay if the workman had been immediately employed by him."</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.268" offset="5349042">My point there is that the statute itself contemplates the contracting of the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.950" offset="5379762">We say here that the work being done was a part of the trade and business of the respondent.</text>

            <text syncTime="2281.262" offset="9124989">At that time, the district judge inquired if he had anything in reply, he asked a direct question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.995" offset="9175980">The Court said in the event, I'm reading from page 48 at the bottom of the transcript, the Court said in the event, I overruled your motion that you contemplate putting up in a testimony in reply.</text>

            <text syncTime="2361.392" offset="9445564">Thereupon the Court granted the motion and then again, he asked the petitioner if they had any testimony in reply and they said that they had none.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.998" offset="9491958">Then, the Court permitted us to make our motion for a directed verdict and we submit that there again was a question presented to the petitioner as to whether or not they had made an election with regard to whether or not they proposed to offer any testimony in reply.</text>

            <text syncTime="2420.814" offset="9683174">He stated there in his motion was that we move to strike the affirmative defense with respect to those allegation that the plaintiff is precluded or excluded from bringing this action by reason of the fact that he was engaged in work which is part of the trade, business, and occupation of the defendant within the meaning of the Workmen's Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.008" offset="9756003">For the reason that it has been conclusively demonstrated that the defendant is not engaged in the business of constructing substations and the business of Bouligny was one for the construction of substations and under the provisions of the Act under which the defendant was incorporated, it was he, engaged in the business of supplying and distributing electricity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.776" offset="9831027">Now, that was the grounds of its motion and it was directed against the part of that defense which had been agreed upon and ruled by the Court in the conference immediately preceding the trial that there was only one issue here and if we establish that defense then the petitioner concede, the district judge concluded that we would have a complete defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.264" offset="9952967">With regard to the testimony of Mr. Byrd, which my adversary would affect, we submit that the testimony itself stands in the record to be examined by this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3343.497" offset="13373962">And on page 38, the witness was specifically asked on cross-examination, “How long prior to the construction of this substation that Mr. Byrd got his arm spurned off on?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.435" offset="13433731">“Has been since the substation had been constructed in behalf of the Blue Ridge off by that?”</text>

            <text syncTime="3428.197" offset="13712718">Then, when he was equivocating, the final question was put to him.</text>

            <text syncTime="3439.291" offset="13757127">That was a final retraction of all his previous testimony by which -- by which they sought to sustain their affirmative defense and we submit that left the record with no evidence upon which the affirmative defense can be sustained on a theory of proof which they presume.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.767" offset="13834971">And so far as the witness Mr. (Inaudible), significantly enough, he did not testify that the employees of the respondent company built any substations and I call your attention to that, to his testimony.</text>
