          <heading>Argument of Leonard B. Boudin</heading>
          <turn speaker="leonard_b_boudin" startTime="0.000" stopTime="470.735">
            <label>Mr. Leonard B. Boudin</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">-- decisions of this Court in Slochower, the appellees immediately turned their position before the Appellate Division in a supplemental brief in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.245" offset="64888">And thereafter, the Court of Appeals are now here into a complete forgetfulness as to the reason given by them by which they are court-bound for the original discharge, a complete forgetfulness as to the inference that was drawn and they attempted to assimilate this case, therefore, to Garner moving back.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.673" offset="154645">Now, the distinction between Garner and our case may be set forth as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.449" offset="177737">In Garner, there was a precise disclosure statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.182" offset="200725">In this case, there is not a disclosure statute precise or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.492" offset="221936">In this case, there is an evidentiary statute, that is a statute stating that upon certain kinds of evidence, so-called, which I will discuss in a few minutes, evidence of unreliability, the employee may be discharged and we would take the position here that whatever may be the duty of the employee of a state employer under a statute possibly under a regulation, I don't have to meet that issue, under a statute stating that you must disclose.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.990" offset="343876">Although, we're not saying what consequences might be, either way.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.881" offset="363520">The situation is different where the State is required to prove its case by evidence and that Garner is simply inapplicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.646" offset="394553">Now, in the Appellate Division while Garner appears, referred to very frequently and in the Court of Appeals while Garner is also referred to very frequently, actually neither court, being a judicial body, wanted to or was able to get away completely from the precise reason given by the appellees for the discharge, namely, the inference that was drawn from the assertion of the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.905" offset="511582">And so, said the Appellate Division at page 35 of the record repeated thereafter, “It's true we may not infer that appellant is a member of the Communist Party from the decision of the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.325" offset="565290">On the other hand,” and I call this Court's attention to the “on the other hand,” “on the other hand, we are required to and should accept this truthful, his statements of answers to the questions propounded might have tended to incriminate him.” In other words, they will not draw the inference, but they will draw the inference.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.339" offset="637283">Otherwise, the sentence has no meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.014" offset="648046">And thereafter, the Appellate Division, the Court of Appeals said at page 63 of the record -- pardon me, it's page -- yes, 63 and 64.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.512" offset="706038">When the employee refuses to tell his employer whether he is a member of the Communist Party, surely he is giving evidence of reasonable grounds for doubt as to whether as Mr. Justice Brennan said in the special term opinion, “He might be a member.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.402" offset="781584">He is giving reasonable grounds for doubt as to his trustworthiness and reliability as a security risk.”</text>
            <text syncTime="202.239" offset="808856">And as we say, it seems to us clear that the opinion in Slochower and indeed the dissenting opinion in the Slochower to the extent that they moved along on the issue do not accept as justifiable, as consistent with due process, the inference of unreliability which all the courts below as well as the appellees drew in the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.947" offset="887745">Now, there is one other reason why this is not Garner, citing the fact that this is not a disclosure situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.824" offset="919197">There is a radical difference, as I suggested before in my statement of the facts, between the employer, who, as this Court believe, has a duty, has a right to ask his employees certain questions about his own employees' record and the kind of investigating official that the Commissioner of Investigation of the City of New York is.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.398" offset="1017522">There are two points that I am now making.One is, the Commission of Investigation is not the Transit Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.295" offset="1045107">He's a part of a different government.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.355" offset="1061407">And the second thing is that the Commissioner of Investigation has a broad sweeping power and this would be an extension of Garner.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.049" offset="1096098">This would mean giving a -- an investigating official the power to ask the people about other people and ask the details about one's life, because in large part of the waiver doctrine that will be implicit in the witnesses and to ask to himself in answer that he could very reasonably give to his employer without the slightest danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.297" offset="1173107">Now, what do they say about the Commissioner of Investigation?</text>
            <text syncTime="297.654" offset="1190557">In our petition, we have -- we pointed out that the investigation was initiated.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.014" offset="1216052">I hope the Court will remember my word initiated at the instructions of the mayor of the City of New York who told the Commissioner of investigation to investigate a number of employees in various agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.435" offset="1265685">The City of New York was the lessor, a lessor of a physical property of the Transit Authority and it is because the city was a lessor that they argued below that the city had a right to have its Commissioner call the employees of the Transit Authority and we disputed that and we lost in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.458" offset="1353770">What we did we lost in the court below on a ground that we cannot argue here, namely that the City Charter gives the Commissioner certain jurisdiction to investigate virtually anything he wants to in -- under the -- under the standard of the best interests of the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.962" offset="1419807">But the fact that he has power of the City Charter to investigate an employee of the Transit Authority or a person who was not employed by any agency of Government at all does not make him the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.724" offset="1474873">He is still not the employer of appellant and this was recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.261" offset="1497025">Again, it's -- it's the second thing that the appellees have forgotten since the original argument in the State Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.620" offset="1526387">This was recognized in the State Supreme Court by the appellees and by Mr. Justice Brennan with special terms, because the appellees pointed out in the State Supreme Court that this had been initiated by the Commissioner of investigation and they said there's no reason why the Commission of Investigation can't make available to the Transit Authority anything in his possession and that the Transit Authority cannot use whatever the Commissioner gives it, in the same way that it could use evidence coming from a congressional committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.796" offset="1675180">And I refer Your Honors to page 8 of my reply brief where this quotation is set forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.563" offset="1706214">It is submitted and I'll only read the first line that under the Security Risk Law, the authority may consider and weigh evidence from any source whether it be from the Commission of Investigation, the police department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation or evidence of testimony before any legislative or congressional committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.184" offset="1788656">Now, it may be that they can consider anything they get, what all this proves is, at the Commission of Investigation was treated by the Transit Authority, not as their agents authorized by the Transit Authority to act as an employer or the place of the employer, but as a source of information which anybody including a grand jury or congressional committee might have made available to the -- to the Transit Authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="487.376" offset="1949466">If Your Honor will recall my emphasis on the federal character of the proceeding of the federal purposes of the state laws that my client had a right to treat this as a federal proceeding, because the purpose of the statute and the purpose of the activities of the Commission of Investigation was to aide the National defense program.</text>

            <text syncTime="517.471" offset="2069838">Then, I -- I treat this as a constitutional privilege against self-incrimination, not necessarily onto the Fifth, but the constitutional privilege in breadth and that was I think how the courts below treated her.</text>

          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="530.375" stopTime="531.343">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="530.375" offset="2121456">What do you mean in breadth?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="leonard_b_boudin" startTime="531.343" stopTime="619.167">
            <label>Mr. Leonard B. Boudin</label>
            <text syncTime="531.343" offset="2125322">Well, I mean the court below, the Court of Appeals and the other courts did not distinguish between the constitutional privilege under the Fifth Amendment and the constitutional privilege in the self-incrimination under the state constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.954" offset="2179762">They were treating this as if the witness had come before a state body and was pleading whatever privilege he possessed against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.694" offset="2222707">And if that is the case, then we say it doesn't make any difference whether the Commission of Investigation was a federal body or a sapient body.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.418" offset="2269623">We still had the right not to be discharged by the Transit Authority because the Commissioner, a different -- a different group of people decided to ask questions and because we pleaded the privilege before the Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.430" offset="2321659">Now, however, we are the ones who have said that in addition to the state privilege against self-incrimination which cannot be used by the Transit Authority as the grounds -- as evidence of disloyalty, in addition to that, we say that because the Commission of Investigation was acting as a federal agent, this was precisely as if we had asserted the constitutional privilege before a federal body.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.461" offset="2433776">And therefore, a right to assert it was not only comprehended within the Fourteenth Amendment, but a right to assert it was an immunity and privilege under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>

          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="619.167" stopTime="639.679">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="619.167" offset="2476617">Well, assuming that you would plead it simply or state it's just amendment privilege period, would you then say that as a matter of federal constitutional detection that still this -- the State couldn't use that anyway it wanted to?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="leonard_b_boudin" startTime="639.679" stopTime="708.780">
            <label>Mr. Leonard B. Boudin</label>
            <text syncTime="639.679" offset="2558642">I think that if we set it our privilege against self-incrimination, whether we pleaded our state privilege or our federal privilege, the -- the drawing of an inference that the assertion of either privilege was evidence of disloyalty or possible disloyalty will be arbitrary action within the definition of Slochower, but Slochower did not depend of course upon the tribunal before which it was, this too was dependent and brought upon the fact that it was not a responsible employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.622" offset="2682462">But the immunities and privileges point in Slochower is not passed upon the Court as Your Honor recalls.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.569" offset="2706181">In short, I say that when you assert your privilege against self-incrimination, whether you say under state law or do you stay under federal law, whether you say on the state law because you regard the state privilege is broad enough to protect you, Murdock, not withstanding, against the danger of incrimination under federal law, no matter how you plead it, it is arbitrary and unreasonable under Slochower for that plea of the privilege to be treated as evidence of disloyalty.</text>

            <text syncTime="808.126" offset="3232496">And in this case, we don't have the employer asking the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.208" offset="3244826">We have a city agency asking the question and the employer saying that that is evidence upon reliability.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.463" offset="3269799">And may I come down to one more point but I will, of course, proceed further on this if I'm asked and that is that there was a dual reason for the discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.126" offset="3312431">Your Honors may recall my stating that the original letter of suspension merely referred to the invocation of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.716" offset="3346808">But the discharge letter referred to other activities and there was never a hearing on those other activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.654" offset="3374602">There was never an elucidation about those -- other activities were.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.327" offset="3389231">And so, we say that is a denial of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.367" offset="3405427">Now, let me, because I would not want to, even in the short time, I'm leading for my main argument, avoid the constitutional -- the jurisdictional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.471" offset="3441789">The jurisdictional issue was raised by appellees unless they developed it further, in which case I can respond to what seems to be this.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.298" offset="3469166">That the appellant should have gone to the Civil Service Commission on an appeal, rather to have gone into the State Supreme Court for review of the Transit Authority's action.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.756" offset="3510962">This is really an argument of the non-exhaustion of the administrative remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.516" offset="3526008">Now, there are a number of answers such as for example the appellees' acquiescence in the courts below on this particular way of testing the constitutional problems involved and the fact of the statute that we're dealing with here provides that when we go to the Commission, if we do, not to say what happens when we don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.494" offset="3597897">We can never appeal to the courts, so said the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.820" offset="3607197">We have the right to take the statute as its worth, but there is a real and finally there's a principle in New York Administrative Law which I cited in one of my earlier briefs, brief in opposition to the motion to dismiss the appeal, that you have a choice normally of going either to the highest administrative body in the State or going into the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.363" offset="3693401">If you go into the courts, you have a greater power of review than if you go to the highest administrative body.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.459" offset="3713776">But the real answer, the answer that I might have given at the beginning of this discussion is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.427" offset="3733629">We raised all the federal constitutional issues in the lower courts including the Court of Appeals and the Court of Appeals and the other courts decided those issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.197" offset="3772709">The question that this Court has said so often of whether or not federal issues are raised as a matter normally of federal -- of state court procedure and the state court was perfectly satisfied as were the appellees up to recently to have the issues decided by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.230" offset="3840836">Now, I want to turn in possibly two minutes of my final discussion to the other points that I made in the brief, because while I think that the issue can be determined by the Slochower and Konigsberg principles, now, I may say, if I must Mr. Justice Harlan, by Footnote 9 even though, Your Honor, is not concluded that's one of the position to the Konigsberg decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.079" offset="3944281">I want to point out in point (4) of our brief, we take the position that the State cannot decide that an employee can be discharged for membership in an organization even if it'd be the Communist Party, in the absence of some kind of emergency situation which we justify such drastic action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.411" offset="4029544">And that in 1954, we submit, there was no emergency which would justify the discharge of an employee of the State of New York, subway conductor, a humble man, opening and closing doors or not and as if even if he had joined the Communist Party, even if he was then a member of the Communist Party, and is certainly with no emergency, which call for the discharge of a man for stating the constitutional privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.147" offset="4128496">Now, it may be asked whether we ever reach this point and the reason why it is conceivable we reach it, if I fail to prevail on the other points, is that we were discharged not for nondisclosure as in Garner, but discharged because there was evidence of unreliability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.191" offset="4196728">And we may just as well take the maximum of the evidence and say, “The inferences were drawn that he was or might have been a member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.592" offset="4230269">So, if Your Honors disagree with me on the earlier points which I have made, we may be faced with the question a kind of discharge for inferred membership in the Communist Party be valid if the employee is a subway conductor in the City of New York, not the Federal Government waging the war, if the year is 1954 and if his duties are the duties which have been described incontrovertible in the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.970" offset="4331833">They add a few more duties in their appendix to their brief which Your Honors, I don't think, can consider as part of this record, namely, that the subway conductor might go on the tracks because he has a badge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.175" offset="4376660">Well, I submit that without a badge, the millions of passengers who travel on the New York subway system can do exactly the same kind of theoretical damage that is suggested here and can go on tracks and go into washrooms and control the same number of bonds as a subway conductor can possibly do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.762" offset="4446981">Subway conductor, who I may say, from this complaint, have the presumption of -- of good conduct above the average train passenger because of his record as a loyal employee for 21 years, I did not indicate anything further on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.575" offset="4514273">I will withhold if I may be clarified.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel T. Scannell</label>
            <text syncTime="1142.761" offset="4571011">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.374" offset="4581460">We have here before the Court a challenge as to the constitutionality of the Security Risk Law of State of the New York, both as it is written and applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.979" offset="4635899">Now, it is true that the Korean crisis or the Korean War did cause the New York State Legislature to come in to action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.599" offset="4682292">Now, it's also true that they were concerned with the defense and security of the Nation, but what Mr. Boudin forgot to mention is they also said they were concerned with the defense and security of the State as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.163" offset="4748643">I may reach the conclusion that it was time to take a look at the public employees in the State of New York and determine whether there were any such employees who were members of subversive organizations or employees who, because of doubtful trust and reliability, should be removed from certain security positions or security agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.755" offset="4874971">That was the objective of the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.377" offset="4893466">And the legislature in setting up the machinery in the Act provided that the State Civil Service Commission should determine which agencies would be security agencies and they setup certain norms that the agency would have to do with jobs which had a -- a relationship to the security of the Nation and the State or where confidential information having the same relationship was handled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.725" offset="5026900">They further provided that in the event the agency as such was not found to be of such a character, that there maybe certain jobs in that agency which would be of that character and they would be designated as security jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.111" offset="5092415">Now, the legislature was also very careful with the term “subversive organization” and they defined it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.052" offset="5124180">They defined it as any group which advocated the violent overthrow of the Government by force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.798" offset="5151138">They also empowered the State Civil Service Commission to make listings of such organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.093" offset="5180291">And they required, however, that the State Civil Service Commission would be responsible for having a hearing and which the organization to be listed could have an opportunity to present its side of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.118" offset="5244447">In addition it provided that they could avail themselves of existing list of such organizations, if the list were made by the Federal Government or by the State Board of Regents, provided however, such listing was made after due hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.971" offset="5311843">Now, the State Civil Service Commission did avail itself of such a listing of the Communist Party which was made by the State Board of Regents in 1953, after extensive hearings as to the aims and purposes of the party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.236" offset="5384882">And it was concluded and it was adjudicated that the Communist Party did have as one of its policies the violent overthrow of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.239" offset="5428872">Now, I think the procedure followed in the Security Risk Law, can best be illustrated by what happened to Mr. Lerner himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.959" offset="5491775">The State Civil Service Commission listed the Transit Authority as a security risk agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.863" offset="5519360">And the mayor of the City of New York desiring to have this security risk program carried out with a certain degree of expertness, decided that as to all city security risk agencies, the Commissioner of Investigation would conduct the inquiries as to whether an employee was a security risk or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="1415.052" offset="5660108">I'll be very happy to, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.555" offset="5670139">The Transit Authority is the successor to the old New York City Board of Transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.674" offset="5702635">It is a creature of the State of New York and the reason it was created was that there was a large operating deficit in the operation of the transit facilities and the city was not raising the fare to meet that deficit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.217" offset="5772852">So, the legislature came along and said, “We'll create a separate body and that body will be compelled by law to charge a fare which will produce operating revenue equal to operating expenses.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.350" offset="5821336">But they transferred all of the employees to the New York City Transit Authority and they provided by law that any of the facilities formerly used by the old Board of Transportation, namely, of other city agencies could continue to be used by the Transit Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.662" offset="5910570">Now, when Mr. Lerner was called as part of this security risk investigation by the Commissioner of Investigation, he was directed to go there by his employer, the New York City Transit Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.911" offset="5975562">And the Court of Appeals, which is the highest New York state court, found that the Commissioner of investigation was acting not only for the City of New York, but also for the employer, the New York City Transit Authority when he examined Mr. Lerner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.704" offset="6058736">Now, Mr. Lerner appeared before the Commission of Investigation and he was asked a number of preliminary questions and then they came to the question, “Are you now a member of the Communist Party?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.812" offset="6115161">Mr. Lerner declined to answer on the grounds that it may tend to incriminate him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.321" offset="6137208">The examiner said, “I think this is something you should give some consideration to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.585" offset="6158315">Why don't you go home and think it over and come back in a week?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.244" offset="6176914">Mr. Lerner came back in a week on September 21st, 1954, I believe it is or 1953 and he -- no, it's -- it's 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.552" offset="6230204">He came back and he said, “I would like to get an attorney before I -- before I resume the examination because I want to be sure of what my rights are on this situation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.092" offset="6284330">He came back with an attorney sometime around September 30th.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.393" offset="6297496">The attorney said, “I would like time to prepare,” which time was given.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.974" offset="6315886">He returned again on October 8th with the attorney and he took the same position that he would not answer questions as to present Communist Party membership because to answer would tend to incriminate him and he invoked the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.618" offset="6398433">Now, the Transit Authority was, of course, notified of this and they gave the matter consideration and then sent a notice to Mr. Lerner informing him that they concluded that he was a security risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.702" offset="6478785">And in Mr. Boudin, reading from the record or referring to the record, he said that they told him because he had invoked the privilege against self-incrimination, he was found to be a security risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.092" offset="6536359">That tells only half the story.</text>

            <text syncTime="1671.888" offset="6687451">This action has been taken because on September 14, 1954, while testifying under oath at the office of the Commission of investigation of the City of New York, he refused to answer questions as to whether he was then a member of the Communist Party and invoked the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.870" offset="6775432">The same notice was sent to him when he was notified at his dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.338" offset="6805316">Now, there are -- the information contained in the notice, contained in a narrative form and informed him that because he had refused to give the information he was asked and relied on the invocation of the privilege, he was considered as a security risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.756" offset="6886922">I think it is unfair to say that the reason he was dismissed was because he had invoked privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.279" offset="6921091">Now, in any event, at that point that the authority notified him that he had 30 days within which to produce affidavits or statements as to why he should not be considered as security risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.838" offset="6987337">During the 30-day interval, the authority heard nothing from Mr. Lerner or anyone representing him and they, then, thereupon notify him of his dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.254" offset="7032999">Now under the Security Risk Law Mr. Lerner, could have gone to the State Civil Service Commission and appealed his dismissal or his holding that he was a security risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.176" offset="7104679">And before the State Civil Service Commission, he could have done a number of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.406" offset="7121607">He could have challenged the designation of the Communist Party as a subversive organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.494" offset="7145953">He could have challenged the designation of the Transit Authority as security agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.696" offset="7166746">He could have challenged the conclusion that his position was a security position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.426" offset="7185659">He could have challenged the conclusion of the Transit Authority that he was a security risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.402" offset="7209587">But instead, he went directly to Court to challenge the constitutionality of the Security Risk Law and at special term, it's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.763" offset="7246994">The Transit Authority did argue that he had not exhausted his administrative remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.816" offset="7267161">And the judge at special term said, “Since there are no decisions on the constitutionality of Security Risk Law, I will undertake to pass on it,” but it is significant that the judge at special term noted that Mr. Lerner was complaining about a lack of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.149" offset="7368516">And then on page 22 of the record, the Court said, “The Security Risk Law,” this is the first paragraph beginning of that page “also provides for an appeal to the State Civil Service Commission by any person who feels himself aggrieved by determination of transfer or dismissal,” but petitioner did not avail himself of this relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.422" offset="7465587">It is observed that upon appeal, the State Civil Service Commission has given wide latitude to require amplification of the reasons given for the action appealed from, to hold or conduct public hearings or private hearings and to subpoena and compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of books, papers, records and documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.632" offset="7558478">Upon such hearing, the employee is given the right by the statute to be represented by counsel and to present evidence in his own behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.358" offset="7601424">Now, the position of the Transit Authority on this appeal is that the petitioner or the appellant does not have the right to challenge in this Court any of those items which he could have had a full review on before the State Civil Service Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="2236.919" offset="8947670">I would like to point out that I think this is the situation that was presented in Garner, except that in reality, it's a stronger situation than Garner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.160" offset="8996571">In Garner, as I read the case, you had a general enactment in 1941 which said employees may not belong to organizations which advocate the violent overthrow of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.616" offset="9050384">Then, you had it implemented in 1948 by an enactment of the municipality of Los Angeles which required that the employees supplied by affidavit information as to Communist Party membership present and past as well as the Communist political association.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.997" offset="9127915">But there is nothing in the case to indicate that the local legislative body in making that directive had reached any conclusions after hearing as to the nature and character of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.709" offset="9190818">Now, in the instant case, you have a full scale hearing at which the aims and purposes of the Party had developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.592" offset="9222269">And then, the question is put to the employee as to whether or not he is a member.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.275" offset="9253094">Now, I think the situation is clearly distinguishable from Slochower in that you don't have any of the automatic forfeiture features on the posing of the question as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.614" offset="9310354">It's true by refusing to answer the question he was deemed to be a security risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.101" offset="9344313">But it is not the situation you had in also Wieman against Updegraff where the employee had to take the oath at his peril and there wasn't a provision for scienter or knowing membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.893" offset="9403559">Now, of course, if the decision is reached that the scope of the Fifth Amendment is so broad that it released the employee of all obligations to answer his employer, I would suggest that you're really going to have a new era of employer-employee relationships and the employer will be compelled in almost all instances to start to seek information and evidence from sources other than the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.252" offset="9552980">The traditional thing, as I understand it, both in public and private employment is if there's a question involving the employee to go directly to the employee and ask him and the employee is under a corresponding obligation to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.125" offset="9632496">And I think that the contention that it's only when a state legislature or a local legislative body frames the particular question and frames the obligation to answer that it's only under those circumstances, is really to ignore the fundamental philosophy present in Garner which is that there are certain, pertinent information, questions which the employer may put and which the employee is under an obligation to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.119" offset="9768438">Now, the attorney for the appellant has made references to our brief of that special term and I think if the Court reads the brief in each case, it will find that it was in a sense of reciting what the appellant has done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.605" offset="9854328">It says that he refused to answer and gave it as his reason for answering -- refusing to answer, the invocation of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.985" offset="9891840">All through the case, is the clear indication that it was his refusal to answer, rather than the means used that caused the conclusion that he was a bad risk.</text>

            <text syncTime="2571.671" offset="10286602">We, here, urge that under the striking of a balance between the public interest, the Government's interest in the protection of the freedom of all the people and the total freedom of the individual this application of the statute in this case has been entirely constitutional and I say this after so searching as a public employee to whom that the statute might well be applied.</text>

            <text syncTime="2619.067" offset="10476251">In the first place, it has construed the statute as implicitly permitting the asking of this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.735" offset="10514913">It has also, of course, construed the status of the Transit Authority and the Commissioner of investigation and that is a construction of state statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.564" offset="10570188">It has also said, “Why this petitioner was dismissed and -- and the grounds upon which he was not dismissed.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2758.285" offset="11033078">Because if that were so, we might as well forget about this obligation to answer because practically any employee will be out his mind if he didn't have that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.830" offset="11099220">And moreover, I think that that is -- let's -- let's assume for the purpose of argument ant I stress very strongly, that I'm assuming it for the purpose of argument and I stress very solemnly that I'm assuming it for the purpose of arguing only.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.909" offset="11155540">Let's assume that he's adding the Fifth Amendment as a reason, did add to the doubt in the mind -- that he created in the mind of his employer as to its trustworthiness because he refused to answer the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.608" offset="11242371">I don't think that we are diminishing the value of the Fifth Amendment or disturbing the principle which this Court has laid down in reference to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.967" offset="11287824">If we say that yes, it did add the doubt and that was the reason for it because he is not being forced to answer the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.946" offset="11323768">He is not being prosecuted for contempt for refusal to answer the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.892" offset="11359504">And incidentally, I should say that there's a case pending in the courts in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.221" offset="11380820">I don't think it's unethical to say that Mr. Boudin is counsel for the petitioner there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.087" offset="11400255">We've argued in special terms several years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.181" offset="11412689">It is pending and because Mr. Boudin has asked the Court to withhold decision until this case is decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.396" offset="11441528">There, the employee also an operating employee of the Transit is -- of the New York City subway system, refused to answer the question and did not plea the Fifth Amendment, he was dismissed too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.098" offset="11492310">In other words, the Transit Authority would dismiss an operating employee for refusal to answer the question whether he pleaded the Fifth Amendment or he didn't, but the Fifth Amendment does not protect and I think this Court had said so in a -- in a series of decisions on the Fifth Amendment two years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.181" offset="11600666">It does not protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.155" offset="11608607">It protects rather against being compelled to be a witness against oneself so that the testimony will be used against him in a criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.856" offset="11651344">That is its ineffable value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.587" offset="11666286">But if in pleading the Fifth Amendment and this Court has said so and several of the Justices have said so individually, if he suggests doubt about himself or bring some other disadvantage to himself, that is something which he can't, broadly speaking, avoid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.414" offset="11765656">And if there are further results, he has no complaint under the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.703" offset="11782792">He has had and he has and continues his -- to have his constitutional right to silence and that is what the Fifth Amendment protects and he has it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.874" offset="11851442">Now, in returning to -- and I -- in doing this in somewhat broad strokes, leaving some of the particular question of this procedure here and so on to Mr. Scannell, one challenge that they -- Mr. Boudin makes is to the propriety of enacting or continuing to enact the Security Risk Law -- a Security Risk Law at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.188" offset="11992712">Now, apart from the question that, unless the law was surely unreasonable, this Court and no court will go behind the legislature's judgment that the statute is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.421" offset="12061675">And also, as Mr. Justice Frankfurter said in the East New York case, one emergency may bring us back to the bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.465" offset="12089783">Other -- where emergency may cause its continuance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.265" offset="12105038">I think that the Cole case was decided on the premise that without even a discussion of it that there is certainly a reasonable need for a Security Risk Law at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.811" offset="12175151">And that was in 1956 and I doubt that there is less reason today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.774" offset="12207020">Now, I said that the Court of Appeals has found that this -- the right to ask this question is implicit in this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.344" offset="12269296">I don't think it is necessary to provide by statute for the right of an employer to ask a particular question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.850" offset="12315376">I think if the question is upon the subject which is barred for some constitutional reason, then that may be raised as a -- as it was raised in Garner, such as being raised here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.934" offset="12383713">But I don't think that the statute needs to provide that the particular question may be asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.903" offset="12423523">Now, we have, this Court has held that the right to ask an employee whether he is a member of the Communist Party exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.707" offset="12474828">Now, I think if we go back for a moment to the underlying reason why the Court has so held, we find that the refusal to answer the question in this case meets the ground for discharge under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.044" offset="12552150">Isn't that actually on the theory, if you will, that it fell down to this case but on a theory that Government is not required to employ persons of doubtful trust and reliability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.444" offset="12613695">Now, that has been applied to various decisions to employees generally in the Garner case, to school teachers in the Adler case and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.961" offset="12655804">And here, we have a Security Risk Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.145" offset="12668552">So, what appears to be a fortiori.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.516" offset="12682031">Now, why the Court has held that the question as to Party membership is permissible, I think it's very plain in the context of our times.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.201" offset="12756741">The Communist Party is not a conventional political party and this Court has said so over and over again.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.919" offset="12799582">Unfortunately, and for that reason the -- that question is permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.377" offset="12841482">It is relevant to public employment and it is certainly relevant to employment in security positions and I should add that the State Civil Service Commission has specifically construed the statute as applicable only to persons in security positions and within, in January, the Supreme Court of New York State has upheld that construction and thus far, no appeal has been taken at the same time to appeal has expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.875" offset="12971468">Now, as to drawing doubt from the refusal to answer the question, that is quite a normal reaction to anyone's refusal to answer the question -- a question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.886" offset="13027474">If Mr. Boudin were to ask me, “Did you stop in the clerk's office on the way to the Court room?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.752" offset="13050984">And I were to say, “I won't tell you.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.732" offset="13066867">He, of course, I'm suggesting a doubt is to whether I did or whether I didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.611" offset="13086407">Now, and -- and also as to, “Why on earth won't she tell me?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.890" offset="13099468">Of course, normally, it is -- one doesn't and may not answer a question because when it concludes that it is no affair of the questioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.251" offset="13136980">But in this case, that it is an affair of the Government whether he is or is not a member the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.732" offset="13182851">And we can cite that in this particular case the normal reaction is not an understandable one and a proper one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.929" offset="13227677">Now, as to -- as I've said, the Court of Appeals said the petitioner here was not discharged for membership in the Communist Party and so it's -- in response to Mr. Justice Frankfurter's question, the question of whether one maybe discharged for membership in the Party under this bar or the question of knowledge and so on is not to be decided in this case because for one thing, it is not in the case and, or in addition and for that very reason, the Court of Appeals did not decide it and this Court has held that it will not -- it will not construe statutory provisions before the highest state court has construed them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.169" offset="13472601">I think that -- that, that about covers the three broad issues in -- in the case which I have felt the State Civil Service Commission should bring before the Court.</text>
