            <text syncTime="1446.826" offset="5787272">It has 19 competitors, three of whom are the big three in the automotive industry, Ford, General Motors and Chrysler and 16 other competitors of the aftermarket variety like Niehoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.628" offset="5854459">Proof was made of the identity of all of those competitors at a hearing held May 15, 1952.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles R. Sprowl</label>
            <text syncTime="1475.517" offset="5902002">That was at the very outset of the respondent's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.226" offset="5920810">Immediately thereafter, that was the beginning of our defense that we had much competition in this field that we were perhaps meeting there equally low prices in good faith, but that also, we would be seriously hurt if we were placed under an injunction while our competitors were free of a similar restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.662" offset="6014642">After that, the Commission did see fit to file complaints against two of our competitors, but it is not seen fit to act as to any other competitors in the meantime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.378" offset="6061453">I think the record makes it clear what really happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.769" offset="6075037">The Commission started it out in the first instance to bring test cases against buying groups in the automotive industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.196" offset="6112758">The job for buying groups, it was bond together to build up volume and qualify for a higher quantity discounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.492" offset="6141910">It's -- at the time the complaint was issued against the Niehoff Company, it primarily issued its complaint against members of a buying group called Cotton States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.296" offset="6185169">And its publicity release show that the time that those complaints were issued including one against the Niehoff Company, it was clear that they then issued two or three complaints against, I believe, Niehoff and a company named Edelmann in an unrelated line of automotive replacement parts and perhaps one other to round out the picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.061" offset="6276180">Obviously, the manufacturers at that point were the caboose on this train of enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.988" offset="6299899">At a little later in this proceeding, about the same time this evidence was being put in as to the nature of Niehoff's competition, we made proof of the fact that while the Commission had in the meantime proceeded vigorously against Niehoff, it started to show that it had done nothing in the Cotton States matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.352" offset="6385371">That stirred up the tempest and they shortly started to turn their wheels in Cotton States, but the point is that the reason the whole proceeding in this ignition field is so poorly conceived by the Commission is what they started out to do, was to police group buying and they ended up merely trying to get the Niehoff Company which sells ignition parts under a cease and desist order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.236" offset="6488921">At every stage of this proceeding, we not only made proof of our competition of the fact that they used substantially similar discounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.686" offset="6522671">We gave them the copies of their contracts that were being used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.307" offset="6537195">We put them in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.486" offset="6545868">We gave them dates, names and places.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.884" offset="6555481">We may prove to the fact that if we were under such an injunction, while our competitors were not similarly enjoined in this highly competitive field, we would be put out of business by the order and they all fell on deaf ears.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.954" offset="6615771">When we got down to the conclusion of the evidence and I wish to say that I don't recall the reasons for the delay in this case why did Mr. Kintner explained this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.588" offset="6666344">I recall one substantial delay because the Commission made it clear that they've run out money at that point for the current year for travelling and what we put over the hearings for several months until their next physical budget came into effect which we did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.676" offset="6730606">The -- there was extensive time taken in this matter in cross-examination, in our case by the Commission attorneys which explained some part of the delay and the printed book is not the complete record of the Commission in bringing this case up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.668" offset="6790583">It does not see fit to bring up the exhibits, which were filed as exhibits unprinted in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.444" offset="6829767">When we came before the -- to the point where we have to make request for findings of fact of the trial examiner, we made two requests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.649" offset="6870518">One was really, merely a conclusion of fact that the Commission's action was an abusive discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.384" offset="6897476">I believe that's our last request of finding 75.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.634" offset="6918478">And then, we have 141, which detailed the fact that Niehoff -- the evidence would show that Niehoff would be put out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.226" offset="6956826">It will replace under this order while its competition was not similarly treated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.437" offset="6981695">As to one of those, the hearing examiner found it was beyond his jurisdiction and as to other he refused to make a finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.012" offset="7008026">And then, before the Federal Trade Commission as such on appeal from the hearing examiner's decision and a brief which we filed or dated November 15th, 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.988" offset="7059853">We devoted an extensive portion of that brief to this particular request, all the matter in advance or to further order or do something while they took action against our competition and that Section set forth the evidence which showed that Niehoff would be financially ruined by the order if its competition were free of the order in the meantime and that is the portion of our brief and the argument that related to an oral argument which prompted the comment, which appears in the opinion of the Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="2444.228" offset="9776901">As this court stated in the Bruce's Juices cases, it would be a far cry to just say that all quantity discounts were just illegal per se and they -- they haven't been determined to be illegal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2488.630" offset="9954429">And it was a prior to us that they hadn't made it, so that's why we made the proof of the fact that this wasn't a big industry.</text>

            <text syncTime="2517.004" offset="10068010">Admittedly, every respondent has the defense of after -- in a case involving whether or not he's guilty of illegal pricing of showing that he either did it in good faith and made an unequally low price with a competitor or the cost justification offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.787" offset="10139063">Your Honors pointed out in the Ruberoid case even after they issue a cease and desist order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.858" offset="10159334">Those two defenses are inherent in the order whether it's -- well, to have those exceptions or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.696" offset="10182740">So actually, once you get to the point of a cease and desist order -- to get to a point of a cease and desist order, really, all you need is to establish that the general pricing system they're using is illegal, that they may have defenses as -- as to certain sales within their surprising policy because at one point they met the equally low price of a competitor or that some part maybe or is or might in the future be cost justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.852" offset="10287334">Those exceptions are inherent in the cease and desist order as Your Honors pointed out properly in the Ruberoid case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.497" offset="10313979">So it wasn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.433" offset="10317636">It -- it could have been once you're over the hurry that this type of -- of discount is an illegal pricing method under the Federal Trade Commission under Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.458" offset="10361731">It isn't a serious problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.005" offset="10368000">That's the big issue in the case and I -- I just can't believe that it would take all of the time and effort that Mr. Kintner would indicate or in an ordinary law of this you think nothing of making 18 suits instead of one and -- and carrying them along together, it -- as to where the portion of their budget goes in the automotive industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.133" offset="10456503">I think Mr. Kintner is referring not to the ignition field of the automotive replacement parts industry which Niehoff was in but perhaps the entire automotive industry which is so vast, I couldn't begin to describe its limits.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles R. Sprowl</label>
            <text syncTime="4012.328" offset="16049215">I only like to say one thing, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4017.294" offset="16069172">I think that perhaps I have misled the Court on the 2 (b) defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="4022.962" offset="16091847">The type of 2 (b) defense that Niehoff was endeavoring to make in this case was that you aren't required to meet a competitor's price locally at the point of sale to keep a customer, but it's -- you come within the defense if you meet a nationwide pattern of price discounts established by your competition and that, the Court has held in this case that, “No, that is not a 2 (b) defense.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4050.873" offset="16203442">It isn't sufficient to show that in good faith, you granted these discounts which aren't quite identical to any competitor discount but are substantially about the same of every competitor's discount and you've done it nationwide as a consistent method of meeting their discount in competition that you are not really establishing a cost justification defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="4073.477" offset="16293825">So, as far as this case is concerned, our cost justification then did accept for a very isolated situation where we might have lowered the price to keep an established customer which I'm sure the Commission would let us report and would never make a court case out of it because it's so isolated in local situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="4098.666" offset="16394658">That is -- that is the point I am making.</text>
            <text syncTime="4100.701" offset="16402704">In other words, if I have --if Niehoff should have a customer in Detroit at which it is selling at its least price, then a standard manufacturing company which is one of Niehoff's principal competitor shows up and says, “Look, I can sell you this same product and it is the same at 10% lower.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4123.301" offset="16493192">Then, Niehoff is entitled to lower its price to keep that customer, but that's very -- that's a local situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4131.631" offset="16526524">I'm sure, even after a cease and desist order is entered, that's the type of thing you would report to the Commission and I -- there is no question.</text>
