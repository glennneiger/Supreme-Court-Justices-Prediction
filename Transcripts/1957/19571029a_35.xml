            <label>Ms. Beatrice Rosenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="16.283" offset="65097">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.819" offset="83174">This is a direct appeal by the Government which brings up a problem under the so-called Assimilative Crimes Act and I'd like to take a moment to set the question in its setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.093" offset="136359">The United States Federal Government in almost all of the states, owned areas of land greater or less than, and over much of this area, it has what is known as exclusive jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.555" offset="210129">The full power of legislation is in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.532" offset="230087">As a result, an act is a crime if committed in those areas only if Congress says it is a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.031" offset="272091">Now, Congress has designed for these areas of exclusive jurisdiction, some of the major crimes such as murder, arson, and rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.212" offset="316813">But beyond that, it has said, and this is a statute here involved Section 13 of Title 18, that a person guilty of any act or omission which although not made punishable by Congress, would be punishable if committed or omitted within the jurisdiction of the State in which the federal enclave is situated.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.074" offset="436245">By the laws thereof enforced at the time of such act or omission, shall be guilty of a like offense and subject to like punishment, now, with the phrase, "By the laws thereof at the time of such act or omission," which gives rise to the problem here.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.274" offset="537078">Appellee was indicted under a Texas statute regarding -- impairing the (Inaudible) -- morals of the minor, which was passed in 1950, two years after the enactment of Section 13 of Title 18 in the 1948 revision of the Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.446" offset="637701">And the District Court held that Section 13, insofar as it is docked, state laws passed after 1948, after the federal statute, is an unconstitutional delegation of the powers of Congress and that's the constitutional question which the Government has brought here on direct appeal under the Criminal Appeals Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.292" offset="765074">Now, let me just briefly state the core of the Government's position before I go into the history of the statute because if the history in a sense which gives I think rise to the decision below and which we think answers the decision below as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.536" offset="842083">But basically, our position is this, that this isn't in essence a problem of delegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.272" offset="869042">What this statute is, is the implementation of the federal policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.671" offset="894642">This statute represents a judgment by Congress that for federal enclave it is good federal policy to have mind -- on the whole mind of crimes, those crimes which Congress has not thought important enough to define, conform to the laws of the surrounding areas which govern them.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.971" offset="1023791">And if that's the basis of the statute that this federal policy which is the basis of the statute is more effectively implemented by this kind of a statute which adopt the state laws at the time of the offense then it is by a statute which may be two years old or five years old and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.373" offset="1117414">If conformity is the federal policy, this is a statute which carries out that conformity.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.554" offset="1162136">As I said, that's the heart of our position and we think the history of the statute bears it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.386" offset="1185541">This is an old statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.943" offset="1195677">It was enacted -- first enacted in 1825 to meet the problem of what should be crime on areas of exclusive jurisdiction.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="311.186" stopTime="314.075">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="311.186" offset="1244682">It was enacted in this form.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="beatrice_rosenberg" startTime="314.075" stopTime="1623.348">
            <label>Ms. Beatrice Rosenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="314.075" offset="1256281">No, it wasn't in this form but it was not as originally acted very different, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.303" offset="1281149">In the 1825 version, it's on page 11 of our brief, and it provided that a person committing an act which will -- would be liable to and receive the same punishment as the laws of the State provide for a like offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.678" offset="1366622">This is a -- the 1825 Act, for a like offense when committed within the body of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.514" offset="1393998">Now, that wasn't clear one way or another and that's the question that came up for decision before this Court, in United States against Paul in 1832.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.650" offset="1438511">There, on a certificate of division, from the Circuit Court of New York, this Court, without argument, a very brief opinion by Chief Justice Marshall, which is set out -- footnote on page 11, the whole opinion is set out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.453" offset="1505802">This Court ruled that the Act of 1825 was to be construed as limited to the adoption of state laws in effect at the time of the enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.218" offset="1560869">I donâ€™t think the word is compelled that this was a construction given by this Court and where that decision was not couched in constitutional term.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.112" offset="1604441">It was probably meant to be and it was certainly interpreted by Congress, I think, to be a constitutional decision to the effect that this construction was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.070" offset="1656268">And so, thereafter, Congress has statutes to catch up.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.010" offset="1692003">It did that in 1866.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.287" offset="1705064">It did it again in 1898.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.962" offset="1719798">And at that point, it recognized -- in those two reenactments it recognized the limitations of the Paul decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.537" offset="1750100">It provided that what should be a crime on a federal enclave was that which was a crime by the laws of the surrounding State at the time the Act was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.007" offset="1815928">And as a matter of fact in 1866 and in 1880 -- 1898 and 1899, it went so far as to say that even the repeal of the state law would not affect the federal crime as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.831" offset="1883324">From 1933 on, Congress showed increasingly, I think, that -- shall I say increasing strain against the Paul decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.168" offset="1936614">For one thing in 1933 -- after 1933, there were many more reenactments of the statute, much more frequently.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.041" offset="1988127">There was a reenactment in 1933 to bring it up to state laws at that date and then again in 1935 to bring it up to state laws at that date and then in 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.026" offset="2036088">And finally, in the 1940 Act revision of the criminal code, the reviser said, we see no reason for this pro forma amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.306" offset="2081123">We want to bring in the State the congressional law up to date all the time and therefore they passed the Act in its present form.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.449" offset="2129711">Now, in the period from 1933 before 1948, Congress showed its intention that its basic policy was conformity in several other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.731" offset="2182896">For example, as I've said before, the oldest statutes had provided that even though the state law was repealed, it still remained an offense for federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.237" offset="2248934">Congress changed that in 1933 and provided that it was a federal offense at the time of enactment, that was assumed to be necessary at that time but that if by the time the Act was done, the state law had been repealed then it was not to be a federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.041" offset="2344124">And the legislative history of the various enactments show as Congress said in 1940, legislation of this type is passed every few years in order to bring the criminal law in effect on federal reservations as nearly as possible into conformity with the law currently in effect in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.114" offset="2448405">1935 revision shows that the only reason Congress kept inserting dates was that they thought they had to.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.457" offset="2489783">And Mr. Justice Black, the 193 -- 1933 Amendment which you sponsored, you said as Senator, that while there might be some questions, you have some doubt as to the policy of conformity.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.642" offset="2542550">It seems that if we were going to have conformity in order to be up to date and not out of date.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.314" offset="2573166">Now, I think that it is the Paul decision with which we have to deal but it seems to me that the history of the statute show that whatever may have been true in 1825 or 1832 at the time of the Paul decision, at the time when the federal government was very jealous of its jurisdiction that as of 1948 and as of now, this isn't realistically -- the statute cannot truly fit as if -- one of the opinion said, as if the laws of each of the 48 States have been set out as in extenso.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.518" offset="2778070">That isn't the rationale of the statute.Congress has said so, the language said so, the practicality of the situation shows that what Congress has decided really is that its desirable federal policy to have conformity in this minor matters to state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.556" offset="2870126">And if that's the federal policy and I guess I'm going to say this a few times, if conformity is an invalid policy then this is the statute which conforMs.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.240" offset="2924878">I think it gets those illustrations if we think of it in terms of an important area covered by the statute, traffic regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.272" offset="2957061">In 1933, we were enforcing traffic regulations in existence in 1909.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.099" offset="2988304">And, I think on that basis, one might well challenge the rationality of the statute whereas enforced, it is obviously sensible for Congress to say, if we have a little area in the middle of a State here, the sensible thing is to have traffic regulations the same as the whole surrounding State.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.924" offset="3079628">And I think more basic than that even, the whole justifications of the statute in a sense has to be the policy of conformity.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.886" offset="3123513">After all, Congress without some good reason can't say that an Act, reckless driving let's say, is punishable by six months imprisonment in this area and possible year imprisonment maybe five miles away in another state.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.676" offset="3218704">Now, what's the reason why this is possible?</text>
            <text syncTime="808.287" offset="3233123">This is possible because when you take into consideration the dual nature of our Government, the somewhat anomalous position of federal enclaves in our dual system of government, the primary responsibility of the state in this field of criminal law and particularly the so-called common crime, then it is rational.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.895" offset="3359556">And to the extent that the Paul and the subsequent Franklin decision, upheld the validity of the older form of a statute, this Court recognize that it is rational for Congress to say under our system of government, of federal enclave, it makes sense to have the law of a federal enclave conform to the law of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.948" offset="3463732">And so, if the statute -- if the whole theory of the Assimilative Crime Act is valid, it must be justified on the grounds that conformity to state law is a valid federal policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.904" offset="3527576">And I said I was going to say this several times, if conformity is a valid federal policy then true conformity is a valid policy because it is more real conformity to have it up to date than it is to have it five or six or 10 years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.683" offset="3618691">I think that becomes very clear when -- when Texas cases in relation to two decisions by this Court where it was held that this -- that the federal government could not adopt state laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.305" offset="3681176">And those were Knickerbocker Ice and Washington against Dawson in 253 and 274 United States where on vigorous dissents by Justice Holmes and Justice Brandeis, this Court held that Congress could not pass state maritime as State Workmen's Compensation laws apply to maritime industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.806" offset="3803220">But what's interesting about the majority opinions in those cases is that that was put on the ground that maritime law has to be uniform.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.056" offset="3864137">And it said we couldn't have maritime law, we had law in one place and one law in another and one in the third.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.956" offset="3891722">But this Court has -- the implications of Paul way back in 1832, and the implications of Franklin in 1909 to 16 United States or that when it comes to criminal jurisdiction on federal enclave, it is valid to have non-uniformity.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.941" offset="3967687">It is valid to look to the state law and therefore it -- it is valid to look to the state law then it seems also valid to look to the state law as it exist at the time that the act was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.536" offset="4050129">Now, in addition to that and thinking now particularly in terms of delegation, it seems to me that the history of the statute indicates why this is not an invalid delegation even if it is treated as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.405" offset="4125571">For one thing, the history of the statute makes clear that one has a right to consider in -- at least in the -- in the question of delegation that this is not carte blanche.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.823" offset="4199236">Before the Act of 1825 and at all times then, Congress has designed most of the major crimes, most of the offenses that have come up under the Assimilative Crimes Act are minor offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.223" offset="4272797">There are very some barely serious offenses that are not designed by Congress and they do occasionally arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.003" offset="4299964">But the majority -- but the fact is, however, the Congress has said, we are looking to the state law only in those areas that we do not think important enough to deform so that this is not a sort of delegation to the State saying we have no legislative policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.987" offset="4383869">Congress has a legislative policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.736" offset="4402887">In addition, the courts have held by now and accepted even though it is the lower court's decision that so long as there is any federal policy shown in the field, the Assimilative Crimes Act will not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.399" offset="4469551">For example, the Civil Aeronautics Board had a regulation prohibiting segregation in airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.913" offset="4503615">It was held that in view of that federal policy expressed by that federal regulation, the State's segregation laws did not apply to airport in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.423" offset="4561607">So that again, we have a limited area in which this operates, Congress isn't just generally adopting all state laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.419" offset="4601626">It is adopting those which it has not thought in court and to design.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.264" offset="4625032">It is adopting those as to which Congress has in other fields and administrative agencies have no policy so that this works in the quite limited areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.875" offset="4679471">And thirdly, there is the limitations that adhere from the facts that this is a federal system -- that this is a federal crime declared by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.524" offset="4738090">I take it and it seems to be more theoretical that one could conjure up situations where conceivably the State might have a law which would come within the limitations of the Fourteenth Amendment with the area that is led to the states under the Fourteenth Amendment that would not be covered by the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.686" offset="4834743">And I suppose that's where the greatest possible question of delegation of powers that arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.220" offset="4872777">But this is more -- this is not fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.845" offset="4883331">Actually, this is a -- when one examines this, this possibility cannot arise because these crimes under the Assimilative Crimes Act are federal crimes to be prosecuted by federal prosecutors in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.519" offset="4946024">And therefore, if one does conceive as an area which might be valid to the State under the Fourteenth Amendment, it could not so long as the federal government has to act -- would have to act within the limitations of the Fifth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.842" offset="5015301">So that on this basis, as of 1948 or as of the present time, the implications of the Paul decision are shown by a hundred years of history to be less fraud than may appear at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.781" offset="5099102">And as a result, it seems that as I said in the first place, we don't consider this really a delegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.521" offset="5138077">This is really Congress acting but even if it is thought to be delegation, the delegation is in a very limited area which circumscribed bounds and considering that we are dealing here not within an administrative agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.485" offset="5229923">If -- if one thinks of it in terms of delegation, we are dealing with the problem that arises out of the fact that we are a federal system of government that such -- that we are dealing with an area which even now, is considered primarily the place where the judgment of the State as reflected by the State legislature, this is the area which under our system of government is primarily left for state legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.782" offset="5347056">On that basis, even as delegation, we think as of this time that delegation would be appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.224" offset="5388852">But I would like to emphasize that in essence it is not delegation because its Congress that makes the policy and it is a policy which has it -- has its foundation of fact that conformity to state law is something which our system permit and which is rational under that system and that if you accept that as Paul and Franklin do, you accept the principle that there should be conformity and this is the actual conformity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.502" offset="5549976">This Court has held several times and particularly in relation to -- in Clark Distilling and Hornbuckle 242 United States that where Congress says, "We will prohibit interstate commerce to things that are in violation of a policy of a State."</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.498" offset="5633985">For example, it is unlawful under federal law to ship liquor into a dry state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.455" offset="5665750">And this comes into effect in the future whenever a State decides to go dry if it does or it -- if the law ceases to have effect when the State decides not to be dry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.618" offset="5714442">This Court -- this Court held in Clark Distilling at that time that that was an unconstitutional delegation because it was the will of Congress that gave this statute its implications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.421" offset="5781629">It was the will of Congress that made the act criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.469" offset="5793855">Well, that's the same thing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.065" offset="5800229">It is Congress -- if the policy of Congress, not the policy of the State, it's the policy of Congress that said, "We think it's a good government for a federal enclave to have these on the whole minor laws conform to the laws of the surrounding State."</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.118" offset="5896464">And to that extent, we -- it is the federal will that makes this thing a crime and we think that the rational, although different, is very much the same because it is the will of Congress and it is based on a policy which under our federal system has validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.377" offset="5989460">I just want to make one point in answer to my opponent's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.404" offset="6005551">And he cite the -- and placed assembly lines on the Penn Dairies case and the Pacific Coast Dairy case decided by this Court in 318 United States which deals with the field of regulation licensing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.973" offset="6079843">Those are cases which arise under the civil law and the civil law of federal enclave is different from the criminal because in the civil law, Congress has not acted except in very limited areas, taxation, workmen's compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.842" offset="6155285">On the civil law, Congress has not passed the equivalent of the Assimilative Crimes Act and this Court has said that what you apply there is the rule of international law that you take over the private law as it was at the time of session.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.661" offset="6222576">But if the absence of action in a sense that has made the problems of federal enclave, these have been a subject to the two volume study by the President's committee but the problems are almost or to a large extent I should say, civil and many more cases, a matter of fact, into -- have arisen which presents problems in the civil field rather than the criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.701" offset="6326753">And one of the reasons for that is the very fact that Congress has not made -- affected general policy in the civil field whereas in the criminal law, it has consistently done so and its policy looking over this hundred years of history is clearly that that as to minor offenses, conformity is a desirable policy and as we say this is the statute that has the true, the contemporaneous, the actual conformity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.356" offset="6457365">And for that reason, we think it is constitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="1948.224" offset="7792849">Mr. Chief Justice, I have examined the Texas criminal laws in that respect because I anticipate it and that is a valid question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.300" offset="7833182">In the language of the indictment, that is to say that if you assume that the -- that the indictment speaks the facts, I do not know any Texas law which is covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.677" offset="7878635">You'd noticed that one of these counts, if it had alleged the act itself, possibly it would be covered by -- by another Texas Act enacted prior to 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.889" offset="7923461">But it alleges the crime of enticing the -- the prosecuting witness into the room for the purpose of proposing the Act which was not prior to that time covered by any Texas statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.651" offset="7970586">I believe they're not in the Texas statute which we cover the challenge in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.498" offset="7993992">And according again to what Mr. Justice Harlan has said, we believe that if Congress had scrutinized as criminal acts of the states when they adopted state laws, that they would have excluded such acts as Texas Article 492 on -- on miscegenation because on the face of it, the United States Attorney for the Western District of Texas had a duty to prosecute right now, today in a federal court, a Negro airman and his wife living together on Randolph Air Force Base in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.048" offset="8144144">Now, if a grand jury were to indict -- a federal grand jury were to indict, the United States Attorney might move to dismiss and the judge might grant the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.264" offset="8188970">If he was tried and convicted, it might very well be that the indictment itself, the conviction will be held void and unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.649" offset="8234527">But the point is that the Congress in the first instance has the duty to ensure the citizens are not punished federally in the first place by laws which Congress itself were independently considered foolish and unwise and it has the duty to ensure that citizens are not subjected to the harassment and expense of defending themselves to prosecution under laws which Congress independently would consider to be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.996" offset="8367961">Now, the President had a role in this legislative process also.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.404" offset="8393561">And we think that this prospective assimilation of state criminal law seriously depreciates the role of the President in the legislative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.618" offset="8442462">Here's what we mean by that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.463" offset="8449776">If we have Assimilative Crimes Act limited to a date not later than the date of the enactment of the Assimilative Crimes Act then the President, if he feels that certain state criminal law should not be adopted into federal law, can by use of his veto power or the breadth of it, force individual state laws foolish ones or ones he considers unconstitutional to be excluded from the scope of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.113" offset="8568372">And in so doing, his pleasure in that respect would prevail unless overwritten by two-thirds vote of each House of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.332" offset="8609228">But if prospective assimilation of state law were permitted and a state law is subsequently enacted which is considered foolish or mischievous or perhaps unconstitutional and the President considers that that should not be federal criminal law then in order for his disapproval to take effect, he must have the concurrence of majority of both arguable crimes rather than the support only of one-third plus aggravated case in expressing a disapproval of an Assimilative Crimes Act limited to the date of enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.141" offset="8752483">We -- we feel that if a citizen is indicted by federal grand jury for something he does or -- or fails to do on a federal enclave, he's prosecuted by -- by a federal prosecutor and convicted by a federal petty jury and sentenced by a federal judge and confined in a federal penitentiary then these results ought -- ought to flow from the specific imperative of -- of a federal criminal law enacted by the Federal Congress and approved by the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.410" offset="8909636">Now, there's only been one case in 132-year history of the Federal Assimilative Crimes Act in which a federal court has had occasioned to consider whether or not a citizen could be punished in federal court for committing an act on a federal enclave punishable by state law enacted subsequent to the Assimilative Crimes Act and that is the case cited by counsel for the Government, United States versus Paul.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.059" offset="9040144">There, there was an attempt made to prosecute for acts committed on the federal enclave of West Point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.580" offset="9074312">Under the 1825 Assimilative Crimes Act, an attempt to assimilate for purposes of this prosecution, an 1829 New York statute, enacted four years later, John Marshal wrote it is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.343" offset="9133349">It was a short opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.431" offset="9141708">That short opinion does not say that the 1825 Act is to be construed as limited to the date of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.511" offset="9182041">It simply says and actually, the language of the statute as counsel said is somewhat ambiguous because it says that provide -- provides for the same punishment as the laws of the state provide for the like offense when committed within such state, susceptible we think of the construction perhaps either way, certain concept of construction as of the date of the commission of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.260" offset="9289038">Marshall simply said, this 1825 Act is to be limited to state laws enforced at the time of the passage of the 1825 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.186" offset="9332715">As counsel for the Government has said, the Congress had apparently interpreted the Paul decision as being a constitutional restriction, a constitutional limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.682" offset="9398648">And of necessity, all the cases bearing on are mentioning the Assimilative Crimes Act since then, have been dictum -- dicta because Congress has specifically since then limited the -- the force of the Act to the state laws enforced at the time of the Act or at a date prior to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.529" offset="9490077">So, everything has been written about it since then has been dicta.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.871" offset="9507422">There have been several expressions by the lower federal courts in -- cited in our brief in which they have assumed that the Paul case was a constitutional limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.766" offset="9554965">And then what we feel to be as the construction of the language of this Court in the Franklin case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3257.239" offset="13028937">So the Act was entitled and -- and this Court said that they were divesting liquor of its interstate carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.418" offset="13061642">However, in that Act, Congress had picked up the subject matter and they said, this -- this subject matter, this thing, liquor, cannot be transported, didn't impose any criminal sanction for it because it can't be transported if it's in violation of state laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.238" offset="13128934">At least Congress had specifically acted there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.063" offset="13140219">They didn't say whatever state law is passed or whatever law the States passed about liquor or criminal laws, we're going to enforce it criminally in a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.035" offset="13180134">This Court said in the (Inaudible) case that you can't have a crime, and we believe that crime is different from -- from civil law, that you can't have a crime unless the legislature has defined it and the legislature has fixed the punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.949" offset="13247739">Now, if you're going to punish people federally by the -- federal processes, federal grand juries, federal prosecutors, federal petty juries, federal judges, federal penitentiaries, then we believe that the definition of the crime and the -- the fixing of the punishment whether it's six months or five years should be the responsibility even though it may not actually undertake to spell it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.664" offset="13354632">You may do it by reference but it should be the responsibility with the opportunity to scrutinize of the federal Congress.</text>
