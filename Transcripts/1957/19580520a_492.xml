            <label>Mr. Randolph W. Thrower</label>
            <text syncTime="11.244" offset="44931">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.749" offset="62903">This case that's here rises on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.008" offset="96026">The single question involved in this case is whether or not the District Court had jurisdiction of a suit to recover an alleged overpayment of tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.645" offset="142524">The facts here are not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.559" offset="154227">The taxpayer filed his return and in his return, deducted a large loss as being an ordinary loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.587" offset="190276">The commissioner, upon investigation, disallowed the loss asserting that it was a capital loss and does not deducted -- not deductible and asserted a deficiency which was subsequently assessed in the amount of approximately $28,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.413" offset="269584">In response to notice and demand, the taxpayer paid a little more than $5000.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.620" offset="294452">He, thereafter, filed a claim for refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.877" offset="307409">That claim was rejected on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.753" offset="319007">The taxpayer then brought this suit to recover the payments that had been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.242" offset="348891">The Government, in answering the complaint, pleaded that there had been no overpayment, that as a matter of fact, an additional amount was owed and counterclaimed for the balance of the unpaid assessment of about $23,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.234" offset="412839">At the same time, it also moved in effect to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that the entire assessment had not been paid before bringing the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.639" offset="462472">Now the question here is whether or not that motion to dismiss should have been granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.671" offset="490684">It is, we believe, as if A sues B to recover a payment which he assessed to have been erroneous and excessive.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.904" offset="531540">B responds that A not only owed the amount that was paid but also owes an additional amount and B counterclaims for that additional amount as the Government did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.547" offset="582113">Now under all normal concepts of pleadings and jurisdiction, this response goes to the merits of the claim and the counterclaim but does not go to the jurisdiction of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.615" offset="638433">Now we submit simply that the normal concepts of jurisdiction apply in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.889" offset="671556">Now the parties agreed that jurisdiction in the case rests upon a construction of Section 1346 (a) of Title 28 of the United States Code which was familiarly referred to as the Tucker Act of 1887.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.334" offset="749296">Now if I may read certain pertinent portions of that Section it provides, "The District Courts shall have original jurisdiction, concurrent with the Court of Claims, of any civil action against the United States for the recovery of any internal-revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected, of any penalty and so forth, or of any sum alleged to have been excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected under the internal revenue law."</text>
            <text syncTime="221.702" offset="886805">Now the Government, if I properly understand its brief, admits that the literal meaning of this language does support jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.891" offset="931527">Now such an admission, that we believe, is required by the statute, the words, “Any civil action for the recovery of any internal-revenue tax or of any sum alleged to have been excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected,” are very broad and very comprehensive.</text>

            <text syncTime="308.853" offset="1235383">It would be, in fact, difficult for us to suggest any language which could be added to broaden this description if it did not already cover up.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.034" offset="1288046">The Government would, nevertheless, have this Court read into this language the proviso that suit may not be brought where the entire amount claimed by the Government has not yet been paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.756" offset="1343007">Now there is no way we can see where such language can be read into the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.095" offset="1368294">The Government, in reality, is asking for an amendment of the statute to add this proviso rather than simply for statutory construction.</text>

            <text syncTime="627.794" offset="2511099">The Government, for one thing, relies upon general statements made from time to time in decisions of this Court which are stated in generalities which by no stretch of the imagination show that the Court was directing its attention to the particular problem which we have here of a taxpayer who faces an assessment that is greater than he is able to pay but asserts that what he has paid is an overpayment of tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.964" offset="2671804">The Government also ignores what was settled authority in this field for many years prior to the decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.476" offset="2713809">This case -- this question first rose before the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in 1940 and there was a clear rejection of the Government's argument, that was in Coates versus United States, where the Court there stated that these arguments, as I have said, go to the merits of the claim or counterclaim and they do not go to the jurisdiction of the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="720.139" offset="2880470">Now, the Government grounds much of its entire argument here upon the assumption that the bringing of this suit, in some way, restrains the director from the collection of the balance of the tax but it does not appoint to anything which would cause such restraint.</text>

            <text syncTime="1253.837" offset="5015301">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.387" offset="5041528">From the merits of this controversy, there was one single issue whether losses incurred in commodity transactions where deductible in full as ordinary losses as a taxpayer contends or deductible as limited to capital losses as the Government contends.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.847" offset="5123344">As a result of the disagreement and inability to get together in the administrative procedures, a single -- single unified deficiency was determined by the Commissioner of $27,000.Of this amount of that $5000 was paid, claim for refund was filed and rejected and suit was brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.091" offset="5208294">The District Court decided that it did not have jurisdiction because the entire amount of the tax claimed to be due had not been paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.308" offset="5253224">But because the Tenth Circuit did not pass on that jurisdictional problem, it went ahead on the merits and held for the Government and the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.543" offset="5294080">The Tenth Circuit never got to the merits, we just affirmed on the jurisdictional point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.674" offset="5314664">So that point is not before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.469" offset="5329816">The question is whether the District Court or the Court of Claims has jurisdiction where only part of the asserted deficiency is paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.077" offset="5372238">Now we think that under the decisions of this Court which admittedly had not absolutely passed on this problem but we think the guideposts are there and under the whole statutory scheme for the collection of taxes that it's obvious that Congress never intended to allow a suit to be brought in the District Court or the Court of Claims unless the complete amount, the entire amount claimed has been paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.048" offset="5500134">Section 1346 (a) of the Judicial Code and Section 7422 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 contained very much the -- contained the same language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.379" offset="5561469">They say no suit -- well 7422 (a) says, “No suit or proceeding shall be maintained at any court for the recovery of any internal revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously assessed or collected without bringing a suit for refund first, the claim -- filing a claim for refund first.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.953" offset="5651749">Now, essentially that same language was in the Civil War Taxing Act of 1866.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.422" offset="5693649">That Act says that, “No suit shall be maintained in any court for the recovery of any tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.868" offset="5743386">That's pretty close to 7422 (a) with which we're concerned here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.651" offset="5770553">This Court in the Cheatham case in 1875 which concerned a question of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.323" offset="5801273">Discussed the question of whether the sovereign had to make very strict rules for the collection of its taxes and they pointed out that if the Government has to take strict measures for the orderly and prompt collection of its taxes and they said in that connection that the general Government has made payments of the tax claimed a condition precedent to resort to the Courts by the party against whom the tax is assessed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2263.276" offset="9053100">It was not litigated again until the Coates case in 1941 and that case contains a great deal of language which is helpful to the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.293" offset="9097091">We think it's distinguishable on a number of grounds and one of them is the Government's fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.983" offset="9119869">The Government never brought to the attention of the Second Circuit the history, the legislative history and the reasons performed in the Tax Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.216" offset="9152784">In any event, the tax what has already paid by the time the district judge came on for hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.322" offset="9181205">And furthermore, the Second Circuit has -- without adverting to that case, made statements in a number of subsequent and more recent cases which are not directly on this subject but seemed to us to indicate that they would have little trouble being a distinguishing or overruling that case at the present time for instance, in the Bendheim case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.562" offset="9282247">They say that the taxpayer has two independent procedures open to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.286" offset="9301055">The taxpayer should not be allowed to pick and choose a little from each for his own benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.316" offset="9325192">Payment of the amount claimed to be due is prerequisite to a suit for refund in a federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.287" offset="9357061">The Third Circuit, in that same year, came out with Sirian Lamp case which was a case against the director and without adverting to their original Suhr case, held in favor of the taxpayer's position here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.742" offset="9422890">The Bushmiaer case in the Eighth Circuit with one dissent, also, held in favor of the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.864" offset="9451416">Then this case came up in the Tenth Circuit and held in favor of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.089" offset="9472313">We think that the earlier cases are distinguishable that the Second Circuit has practically overruled its own decision in the Coates case and that the only two cases with which we're concerned at the moment are this case and the Bushmiaer case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2404.399" offset="9617554">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.764" offset="9635004">Referring briefly to the cases, I will call to your attention the fact that the Suhr case referred to in the case in the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, that Court 14 years later in Sirian Lamp Company versus Manning, reversed a District Court decision which had, according to the Court of Appeals, misinterpreted Suhr case, and the Suhr case we think is distinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.282" offset="9765094">It was not even referred to by this Court in Old Colony Trust Company versus Commissioner which is cited in our brief and which deals with a case arising under the 1924 Act, the fist act involving the Board of Tax Appeals where there was an appeal to the Board and thereafter, a suit for refund and the Court pointed out very clearly that that suit could be maintained despite the fact that there was an outstanding assessment of the deficiency of which had not yet been paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.155" offset="9936562">The Government has suggested that somehow the taxpayer is at fault who finds himself in this unfortunate position of making himself a judgment proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.274" offset="9993091">I think that is entirely unrealistic, almost unconscionable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.499" offset="10017959">This is the unusual case, most taxpayers fortunately, can pay but their -- by reason of an adverse turn of circumstances or otherwise, a taxpayer finding himself unable to pay an assessment pays as he should pay and is required to pay all that he can.It is immoral to withhold that if it is erroneously and illegally collected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.844" offset="10139376">And this Court so stated in Bull versus United States and to construe these acts, to produce that result, as the Government urges, would be entirely out of keeping with the nature of the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.469" offset="10193816">As this Court has stated in numerous times, in the case that's cited in our brief, this is likened to an action of assumption -- general assumption of the common law where the Court is concerned with the abstract justice of the case.Has there been any unjust enrichment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.159" offset="10292558">If there has been, then it is immoral to retain it even though it was properly collected or legally collected or at least morally collected in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.522" offset="10338011">And dealing with the Tucker Act, Mr. Justice Holmes, and the Emery, Bird, Thayer, Realty Company case said that this is a great act of justice and it should not be construed with a narrow and adverse eye.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.558" offset="10414184">Now with respect to those reasons why a taxpayer may not go to the Tax Court, taxpayers are frequently called upon to turn square corners but Congress for the last 80 years or more has made every effort to label those corners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.106" offset="10488372">The taxpayers have not been put on notice that if they failed to file an appeal to the Tax Court and thereafter, find themselves unable to pay an assessment which they consider erroneous, that they can never seek to recover those amounts which they can take.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.507" offset="10569979">Let me call your attention to the facts in the case of Hanchett versus Shaughnessy which is cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.275" offset="10597042">There, there was an assessment of about $10,000, $700 or $800.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.518" offset="10618044">The taxpayer paid $4100.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.820" offset="10631210">He filed a claim for refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.446" offset="10637688">It was promptly rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.633" offset="10650436">The facts there show that he had entered into an agreement with the director where he would pay the balance of that assessment at $100 a month which would take, with interest, about six years to pay it all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.402" offset="10709577">Under the Government's theory, by the time he got his payments completed even though they were completely erroneous, he would have fully lost his right to recover the early payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.705" offset="10766733">There is no disturbance of the ordinary rules of procedure in a case of this sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.164" offset="10808633">The director can proceed to distrain if the taxpayer is thought to have assets that he's not using for the payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.696" offset="10850743">Now, Mr. Stull refers to the fact that they should not be required to distrain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.855" offset="10875402">They're not required to distrain in this case anymore than the ordinary case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.595" offset="10894315">The significance of these great powers to collect is the taxpayers voluntarily pay of what they can pay and there's no more reason, in this case than in any other case, to assume that a taxpayer could defeat the collection, all that there is any defeat to normal procedures of collection within the director's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.140" offset="11012493">The Government has the right, also, to counterclaim as it did in this case that brings before the Court all the issues that are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.199" offset="11060767">Now, Mr. Stull referred to the fact of an existing practice in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.205" offset="11100787">There's nothing to support that except the fact that the Government has from time to time lost cases on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.860" offset="11135373">They lost one in 1940 and another in 1941.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.213" offset="11160764">The issue doesn't seemed to have arisen again until around 1954 and later and it has arisen since that time in three or four -- three, I believe, excise tax cases where the Government makes the same arguments that is made here relying on the same statute except for the fact that there, the taxpayer, never has any right to go to the Tax Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.864" offset="11259402">The right to appeal to the Tax Court is a relief statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.491" offset="11273927">It gives to the taxpayer the opportunity to restrain further a collection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.808" offset="11299213">The effect of failing to go to the Tax Court, the only effect is that the taxpayer has lost his opportunity to restrain collection of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.598" offset="11342367">There's nothing that was in that relief statute or in its history to indicate that Congress intended to deny jurisdiction to the Court to entertain a claim for refund of taxes that are alleged to be excessive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.368" offset="11425437">If there are no questions from the Court that concludes the argument --</text>
