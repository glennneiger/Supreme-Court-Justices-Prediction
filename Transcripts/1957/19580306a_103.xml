            <text syncTime="8.226" offset="32810">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.925" offset="51618">The question before this Court is whether the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, invoked by our respondents in defense of the right of transfer to operate motor vehicles for compensation in the City of Chicago without a license, should have been considered by the courts below before the exhaustion of state administrative and judicial remedies to determine whether the public convenience and necessity provisions of the 1955 ordinance are applicable to Transfer's operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.156" offset="208562">The Commerce Clause became the decisive issue in the Court of Appeals on the assumption that the standards for determining whether public convenience and necessity require additional terminal vehicle service, apply to Transfer's operation and were intended to grant Parmelee a monopoly of the use of the city streets for interstation transportation service.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.439" offset="353698">I refer to the opinion of the Court which is attached to the petition for -- petition for certiorari and on page 50 where the Court said, “We are convinced that those provisions that is in Section 28-31.1, which would, in effect, limit the number of terminal vehicle licenses to those held by Parmelee on July 26, 1955, and give Parmelee perpetual control thereof, constitute a designation of Parmelee by the counsel of the city, in lieu of Transfer, the instrumentality selected by the terminal lines rather than the exercise of the City's police power over traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.019" offset="627984">In this critical aspect, the 1955 ordinance is invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.817" offset="651180">If there were any doubt that this conclusion is correct, the legislative history of the ordinance dispels that doubt.</text>

            <text syncTime="179.087" offset="716278">The effect of this ordinance, as I understand it, was on the one hand to make Parmelee eligible for an interstation license which it would not have been eligible -- which it would not have been eligible under the preceding ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.838" offset="787331">And in converse to require Transfer to obtain a license before it could operate under its contract with terminals, is that right?</text>

            <text syncTime="212.108" offset="848353">The purpose of the new ordinance, the 1955 ordinance, which was an amendment of an old ordinance by which Parmelee did have a contract for the railroads to perform this interstation service in intrastate and interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.758" offset="931004">It was amended so that the Parmelee operation became a -- a local transportation service only.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.254" offset="973009">That is to carry passengers for cash fares from railroad stations or steamships dock to any place within the City of Chicago - within the central business district of the City of Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.281" offset="1029120">And the Transfer operation was by contract with the railroads exclusively for the transfer of passengers between stations, to carry railroad passengers between these stations while on a -- on a through route ticket and a thoroughfare ticket.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph F. Grossman</label>
            <text syncTime="411.318" offset="1645192">All right.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.554" offset="1658149">Yesterday, I attempted to describe the operations of terminal vehicles by Parmelee from railroad terminal to any destination in the central business district of Chicago pursuant through licenses under a city ordinance before and after amendment in July 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.439" offset="1753652">Passengers were accepted by Parmelee for such transportation indiscriminately upon surrender of a coupon issued by a railroad for transfer between terminals or upon payment of the cash fare without identification as railroad passengers.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.796" offset="1835154">Since Transfer was substituted for Parmelee under the contracts with the railroads, exclusively for the transfer of railroad passengers between terminal stations on through route tickets or coupons.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.725" offset="1894818">Transfer commenced operations under its contracts without application for a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.449" offset="1961796">That was -- that's the situation as it is today.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.994" offset="1987918">Now, the power of the City to exercise its local police powers in the regulation of Transfer's operations is conceded by all concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.384" offset="2045492">And in the opinion of the Court of Appeals on page 52 of the petition for certiorari is a quotation from the opinion of the Court of Appeals where the Court of Appeals said, “Highways, being public property, users of them, although engaged exclusively in interstate commerce, are subject to regulation by the State or municipality to ensure safety and convenience, and the conservation of the highways."</text>
            <text syncTime="553.091" offset="2212362">Now, the Court relied upon the history of the legislation to show that what the intention of the City Council was, was to grant to Parmelee a perpetual and exclusive right to perform the service which Transfer is now performing without a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.187" offset="2352692">And the facts are, however, the referent part was to proceedings before the committee of the City Council at the time the ordinance was introduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.958" offset="2423745">On page 90 to 92 is a correct transcript of the proceedings by court reporters as to what happened at the time of the introduction of an ordinance which originally was a grant or a franchise -- a special franchise to Parmelee, exclusively for the transfer of passengers to and from terminal stations, that's on page 85, and exclusive permission and authority was granted for a period of 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.729" offset="2602841">Now, I went before the Committee and my remarks were misinterpreted, I think, by the Court of Appeals and by the clerk who took the minutes of the meeting down.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.083" offset="2664281">I said that the ordinance, that is the franchise ordinance, was presented to me for consideration and I examined it very carefully, and that I don't think that it is within the corporate power of the City of Chicago, but that the objective could be obtained in some other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.824" offset="2759262">Now then later on on page 92, the questions were asked by some of the older men, one of them -- one question was, “Do I understand that terminal vehicles embrace those vehicles that operate between railroad stations?”</text>
            <text syncTime="710.264" offset="2840973">The Chairman said, “Yes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="712.423" offset="2849646">But I said, “No, it is not.”</text>
            <text syncTime="715.217" offset="2860826">The operation from railroad stations to points within the central business district, which is defined as the area bounded on the north by Ohio Street, and on the south by Roosevelt Road, and the Lake on the east, and Canal Street on the west, is in the railroad terminal area but it isn't necessarily between railroad stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.847" offset="2951314">It may go from railroad stations to hotels and from hotels to railroad stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.310" offset="2973153">That is the operation and that operation can be continued by amendments to the present ordinance without conflicting with any of the statutory provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.702" offset="3026756">Now, the purpose of the amendment which I drafted as a substitute for the franchise ordinance was an annual license fee to permit them to operate as a local transportation facility only.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.616" offset="3094361">And that operation was what was in -- what was -- what the ordinance that was drafted as a substitute for the franchise ordinance was intended.</text>

            <text syncTime="2030.756" offset="8122932">Here is what the ordinance -- the amendatory ordinance was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.556" offset="8134217">“Be it ordained by the City Council, Section 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.201" offset="8144771">Section 28, one of the Municipal Court of Chicago has amended by striking the definition of terminal vehicle contained therein and substituting therefore the following -</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.013" offset="8183954">Terminal vehicle means a public passenger vehicle which is operated exclusively for the transportation of passengers from railroad terminal stations, and steamship docks, the points within the area defined in Section 28-31.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.398" offset="8249574">And terminal vehicle shall not be used for transportation of passengers for hire except from railroad terminal stations and steamship docks to destinations in the central business area of the City.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.690" offset="8306730">Now then comes the section with reference to public convenience and necessity and the section relating to local fares.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.216" offset="8348839">I think that that's -- I had it a moment ago, but I lost the 40 -- I think it is 42, isn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="2107.410" offset="8429610">Now, the provisions of the ordinance which are not amended and which I say is a question for the administrative and judicial departments of the State of Illinois to determine, is that that section which remains at Section 28-2, “It is unlawful for any person other than a metropolitan transit authority or public utility to operate any vehicle or for any such person who is the owner of any vehicle to permit it to be operated on any public way for the transportation of passengers for hire from place to place within the corporate limits of the city except on a funeral trip, unless it is licensed by the city as a public passenger vehicle.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2195.776" offset="8783099">So that the question whether they're engaged in -- even though that -- even though it's in the interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.654" offset="8826567">They are engaged in transporting persons between stations, between two points within the City, within the corporate limits of the City.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.755" offset="8867004">And the -- Judge Schnackenberg said in his -- in his opinion which I read before at the -- in the early part of the day.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.524" offset="8934087">That the City has a right to license the operation even though it is an interstate commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="2491.559" offset="9966132">Under the amendment of 1955, Transfer cannot operate any vehicle in the City of Chicago unless, first, it applies to the Commissioner of public vehicles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.522" offset="10026005">And the Commissioner after a hearing determines that public convenience and necessity requires the vehicles and then -- and here's the thing that for one reason or another, our adversaries don't say anything about, after the commissioner has made a finding, the City Council of the City of Chicago must pass an ordinance authorizing Transfer to operate any vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.033" offset="10148049">In other words, this is not a case merely of application to an administrate for an administrative finding of public convenience and necessity or whatever else you want to call it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.166" offset="10196637">The administrator in effect, if we may borrow a terminology from the regulatory commissions, the administrator is made an examiner, say to use the terminology of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.353" offset="10245329">And he makes a recommendation, but the recommendation is worth nothing unless the City Council of the City of Chicago passes an ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.926" offset="10279602">Now, the City Council of the City of Chicago, if a subject is within its ordaining powers has power to -- thank you -- has power to pass an ordinance or to refrain from passing an ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.374" offset="10361417">So under the 1955 Amendment, which Mr. Grossman himself by signed pleadings in the courts below in the City of Chicago by its corporation council, by signed pleadings in the courts below, has insisted stoutly applies to the Transfer operation here involved, we could not operate unless the City Council of the City of Chicago authorizes to do so by ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.188" offset="10492656">Now, for example, devoting a little more time to this point than I thought I would at the beginning, but I -- I -- it's -- I can see its importance, of course.</text>

            <text syncTime="3009.988" offset="12039941">Now, the transfer agent obtains his pay or his compensation for performing this service from the outgoing railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.288" offset="12077140">That is the Transfer agent collects these coupons and at the end of the month or whatever the time is agreed upon, he sends a statement for all of the transfer coupons he's collected to the outgoing railroad and he's paid by them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.935" offset="12159687">Now, I want to call your attention, something that is I think of greatest importance at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.061" offset="12216216">This Transfer operation through passengers -- oh, I should give you a few statistics, I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.486" offset="12249861">Approximately 3900 passengers per day on the average transfer in Chicago by means of this transfer service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.937" offset="12291657">That is from an incoming station to an outgoing station.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.396" offset="12309525">And more than 99% of this 3900 are travelling between destinations located in different states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.925" offset="12343693">And in the Yellow Cab case in 322 U.S., this Court specifically held that that particular operation is interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.888" offset="12375458">That is the transfer over the Chicago streets of a traveler travelling in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.174" offset="12404611">Now, this interstation transfer of passengers under the contract between Transfer and the railroads and under the former arrangement between Parmelee and the railroads is squarely within the authorization of Section 202 (c) (2) of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.765" offset="12515056">As I said, that Section is setout in full on pages 30 and 31 of our brief, by paragraph (1) of Section 202 (c), transportation by motor vehicle, by carriers, by railroad, or water, or freight forwarders, when performed within the terminal areas of those carriers for transfer, collection, or delivery service are exempt from Part 2 of the Interstate Commerce Act, regulating motor carriers, but are made railroad transportation subject to Part 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.851" offset="12711393">That -- this Section 202 (c) was enacted in 1940, an amendment in 1942 has nothing material to this controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.533" offset="12758100">However, subparagraph (2) of Section 202 (c) provides this, and I'm reading a few lines from the quote at page 31 of my brief, “Transportation by motor vehicle by any person whether as agent or under a contractual arrangement for a common carrier by railroad subject to Part 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.774" offset="12871053">In the performance within terminal areas, the transfer, collection, or delivery service shall be considered to be performed by such carrier,” now that means carrier by railroad, “as part of and shall be regulated in the same manner as the transportation by railroad to which such services are incidental.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.049" offset="12952137">Now, I want to go back now to the impact of the ordinance of the City of Chicago upon -- or the conflict ordinance of the City of Chicago upon this section, but I want to return to this section later on to point out the construction by the Interstate Commerce Commission and the construction of similar statutes by the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.906" offset="13047536">But -- and as I've said at the very beginning, the Court of Appeals held that the one section of the 1955 ordinance abstracted the interstate operation, transfer operation being conducted by the railroads under 202 (c) (2).</text>

            <text syncTime="3751.432" offset="15005675">The interstation transfer service had been performed by Parmelee Transportation Company as agent of the railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="3760.077" offset="15040261">And the City of Chicago, by Chapter 28 of the Chicago Municipal Code, had regulated the operation and those provisions are summarized on page five of our brief and they include licensing for purpose of regulation, a $25 license fee for defrayal of the cost of regulation, and various of the common safety regulations ordinarily embraced in the general term police power.</text>

            <text syncTime="3874.247" offset="15496986">The -- but as I said, on June 13, the railroads made that announcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3880.316" offset="15521228">Parmelee immediately communicated that information to the Chairman of the Public Transportation Committee of the Chicago City Council who was, of course, an older body.</text>
            <text syncTime="3895.296" offset="15581100">On June 16, three days later, the Chairman of the Committee introduced in the Chicago City Council an ordinance that would have given Parmelee a 10-year exclusive franchise to transport -- to transfer railway passengers of any sort between the railway stations in Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3917.999" offset="15671902">That ordinance was laid aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="3921.014" offset="15684023">It never came before the City Council.</text>
            <text syncTime="3923.931" offset="15695621">The ordinance is commented upon by the Court of Appeals and it appears in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3930.511" offset="15721953">But it's -- the only -- its only importance here is just the face of the history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3939.237" offset="15756852">However, on July 26th, 1955, the City of Chicago passed the ordinance that appears on pages 44 and 45 of the record and which is also set out on pages 7 and 8 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3960.231" offset="15840862">Now, the council also amended two other -- another provision of the ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3972.513" offset="15889972">Prior to this amendment, the ordinance provided that no one should have a license, a terminal vehicle license, that is to transport passengers between Chicago passenger stations unless he had a contract with one or more railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="3990.605" offset="15962384">This ordinance of July 26th, 1955 repealed that provision and left it wide open.</text>
            <text syncTime="4000.550" offset="16002194">I mean, it no longer made a necessity of having a contract with the railroads as a -- to obtain a terminal vehicle license, but it did then go ahead in Section 28-31.1 and did two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="4016.610" offset="16066351">It, in effect, said that gave -- gave permanent, perpetual automatic grandfather rights to all license that's outstanding, and the record is clear that they were held by Parmelee.</text>
            <text syncTime="4030.434" offset="16121731">Then it provided that no one else, and that might just as well have said that Railroad Transfer Service Incorporated shall not obtain a terminal vehicle license until they have applied to the public vehicle license commissioner for terminal vehicle licenses, and the public vehicle license commissioner has found that public convenience and necessity require the issue of the licenses and the -- the various categories of considerations that the public vehicle license commissioner can take into consideration including paragraph (4), “Any other facts which the commissioner may deem relevant.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4077.048" offset="16308140">Now, I want to read just a few lines to refer to that ordinance power of the City Council.</text>
            <text syncTime="4083.860" offset="16335412">The ordinance goes further said, “If the Commissioner shall report --,” and I'm reading from page eight of my brief, “If the Commissioner shall report that public convenience and necessity require additional terminal vehicle service, the council by ordinance may fix the maximum number of terminal vehicle licenses to be issued not to exceed the number recommended by the Commissioner.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4107.529" offset="16430080">Now, the Court of Appeals, as I said earlier, held that that particular provision obstructed the interstate transfer of passengers by motor vehicle and was invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="4125.022" offset="16500088">The Court of Appeals also said that all of the rest of the ordinance was valid and applicable and there's no dispute about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4132.520" offset="16530077">Now, I just want to call this to your attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="4136.198" offset="16544705">That if the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed, we certainly think it should be, the situation in respect to the transfer of passengers in Chicago and the regulation by the City of Chicago will be precisely the same as the -- will be precisely the same regulation to which Parmelee was subject for many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="4166.321" offset="16665182">There'd be no change in it at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4167.859" offset="16671347">The only difference will be that Transfer instead of Parmelee will be the railroads' transfer agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4175.477" offset="16701858">In other words, to paraphrase the famous phrase, we think that what was good enough for Parmelee over the years is good enough for Transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4186.238" offset="16744908">And that is the effect of the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="4234.409" offset="16937587">Now, I want to call -- in that connection, I'd like to call your attention to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4239.838" offset="16959321">This 1955 amendment that the Court of Appeals held invalid was not like some motor vehicle regulatory ordinances that are -- or laws that this Court has held valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="4257.358" offset="17029329">This was not aimed at a type of traffic deemed undesirable or as to which particular regulation was required because of this fact that Parmelee was given perpetual grandfather rights to operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4274.854" offset="17099337">In other words, the City Council of the City of Chicago was not striking at the industry or at a type of vehicle operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4283.329" offset="17133296">For instance, like it wasn't saying that nobody can operate if his truck weighs over so much or that a particular type -- specialized-type of motor vehicle traffic can be taxed higher than other types.</text>
            <text syncTime="4296.154" offset="17184601">They were merely saying -- they were merely saying the City Council of the City of Chicago is going to arrogate to itself to determine who shall engage in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="4308.398" offset="17233502">And the Supreme Court of the -- this Court has held beginning back with Gibbons against Ogden and in numerous cases since, that the States have no right to say, who on a selected basis between two types of candidates or operators, the States have no power to say who to select, who shall engage in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="4332.813" offset="17331200">That as a matter of fact, I think may not be entirely relevant right at this point of the argument but I think that this case presents a very striking parallel to Gibbons against Ogden because the State of New York didn't object to steamboats at all on the rivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4353.364" offset="17413433">All it said was that any steamboat that operates on the river must have a license from the State of New York and we won't let any other steamboats operate on the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="4365.435" offset="17461708">Gibbons had a federal posting license which certainly if you will examine the Old Posting License Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4373.725" offset="17494831">It actually gave less powers and imposed less duties than Section 202 (c) (2) of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4380.993" offset="17523879">But in Gibbons against Ogden, this Court held that the Federal Posting License Act superseded the power of the State of New York to grant an exclusive license to Fulton and Livingston for steamboat traffic.</text>

            <text syncTime="5307.319" offset="21229192">That's correct, but I merely wanted to point out that they gilded to lily or frosted the cake or something by saying, “In support of said motion, defendant state that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact contained in the complaint.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5320.106" offset="21280392">Now, in other words, they admitted that they would arrest their drivers under the agency contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="5326.521" offset="21305992">Now, they're talking about the operation under this contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="5329.673" offset="21318635">They're talking about that specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="5331.091" offset="21324278">Well, let's go on a little way.</text>
            <text syncTime="5334.420" offset="21337652">The District Court filed a memorandum opinion in which the District Court held the ordinance valid and enforceable and applicable against this operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5348.245" offset="21392927">That was the whole business including this public convenience and necessity requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5353.231" offset="21412885">And as is customary, the District Court asked counsel to supply proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5362.283" offset="21449038">And in paragraph (2) of the proposed conclusion of law submitted by the City, by Mr. Grossman in-person, and that is on page 122 of the record, this was the conclusion of law submitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5379.151" offset="21516539">“Transfer operates its motor vehicles on public ways for the transportation of passengers for hire from place to place within the corporate limits of the City as provided in Section 28-2 of the ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5394.103" offset="21576411">Now, Section 28-2 of the ordinance is the fishnet or the drag net that catches everybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="5398.873" offset="21595429">If you're within 28-2, you're within the ordinance, and that was Mr. Grossman's own contribution to the final judgment of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5412.666" offset="21650599">That -- that -- and that was the City's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="5418.263" offset="21672960">Well, and I should add to that that in the record 155, 159, Conclusion of Law Number 5, the District Court adopted that conclusion recommended by Mr. Grossman.</text>
            <text syncTime="5437.186" offset="21748715">Now -- and the District Court specifically held as a conclusion of law and dismissed our complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="5446.836" offset="21787272">In other words, and held that the whole ordinance including this public convenience and necessity section was enforceable against us.</text>
            <text syncTime="5456.963" offset="21827814">We appealed to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="5459.192" offset="21836696">Now, what did the City do there?</text>
            <text syncTime="5465.735" offset="21862922">The City came in and by its -- we have filed a certified copy of the City's brief and all of the briefs in the Court of Appeals for that matter with this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5475.515" offset="21902002">And so I -- and I have set out in -- I set out on page 14 of our brief the quotation from the Court, from the City's brief in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="5493.359" offset="21973368">Now, keep in mind that this brief in the Court of Appeals and the City's official brief signed by the corporation council and the paragraph, I won't read all of the paragraph, but on -- I call your attention to that language on page 14 of our brief that the framers of the ordinance in question intended to regulate the business carried on by Transfer wholly within the City of Chicago as hardly subject to challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="5521.599" offset="22086322">Now that's what the City was seeing back in the Court of Appeals and down at the -- and then the City goes ahead in its brief and quotes several sections of the ordinance including 28-1.</text>
            <text syncTime="5536.283" offset="22145045">And the City lines up its discussion by saying in the last sentence, “A more accurate description of the business engaged in by Transfer would be hard to find.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5546.928" offset="22187677">Now, if the Court please, after the City of Chicago has obtained in the District Court and in the Court of Appeals, at its own request and upon its own solemn assurances to those two Courts, that this ordinance is applicable to the transfer operation, can counsel for the City come before this Court and make a representation to say that the City does not so contend?</text>
            <text syncTime="5588.905" offset="22355592">If he can, why then, we might just as well abolish all the rules of procedure and litigation.As a matter of fact, he couldn't make that contention in the Illinois courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5599.937" offset="22399687">I call your attention to the City of Chicago against the University of Chicago cited on page 15 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5607.926" offset="22431660">In that case, the City Council of the City of Chicago had taken the position in the trial court, in the Circuit Court that a certain ordinance was valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="5622.290" offset="22489130">And then as suit of their convenience or suit of their -- they want to suit their convenience as in this case, they took the position before the Supreme Court of Illinois that the ordinance was invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="5634.275" offset="22537091">And here is what the Supreme Court of Illinois said and I think that is what the rule of this Court should follow in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5643.257" offset="22572931">“Having alleged the validity of the ordinance in its pleading and proceeded to a hearing on that theory, the City cannot now be heard to say that the Circuit Court erred in adopting its view.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5656.772" offset="22627056">And to paraphrase that, Your Honors, we say that having alleged in the District Court and in the Court of Appeals of the Seventh Circuit that the ordinance is applicable including the public convenience and necessity, is applicable to the transfer operation from having one on both issues, mind you that both courts -- the courts decided those two issues in favor of the City, the City cannot now be heard to say that the Court of Appeals of the Seventh Circuit erred in adopting its view.</text>

            <text syncTime="5812.514" offset="23250024">The City of Chicago, if it wanted to get rid of this legislation on the theory they now suggest, could pass a two-line ordinance tomorrow saying that the public convenience and necessity provisions of this do not apply to the Transfer operation and what would happen why this whole litigation would be dismissed as moot clear back through the District Court and everything would be wiped out.</text>
            <text syncTime="5833.168" offset="23332571">Why doesn't the City of Chicago do that?</text>
            <text syncTime="5835.507" offset="23341976">They don't do it because they're just not serious.</text>
