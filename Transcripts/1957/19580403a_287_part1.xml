            <label>Mr. David W. Walters</label>
            <text syncTime="18.843" offset="75337">Honorable Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.845" offset="95295">The petitioner whom I represent, presents this Court with what I believe to be legal issue that is very narrow, it involves the construction of a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.282" offset="169064">The statute particularly is the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, a section of it, Section 244 (a) and the various subsections there under.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.809" offset="235207">The petitioner is an alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.708" offset="246805">He's a native and citizen of Greece.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.807" offset="263210">He entered the United States in March of 1947 as a seaman.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.249" offset="284944">His entry was legal but he's thereafter remained beyond the period of time for which he was admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.362" offset="305424">He's been here ever since.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.303" offset="325172">In the course of a -- in administration deportation proceeding, he presented to the special inquiry officer an application for suspension of deportation which is a device established by Congress in 1940 to and particular hardship cases to alleviate deportation and permit an adjustment of status.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.875" offset="447425">Later in 1948, this device was extended in July the 1st, 1948 and with the advent of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, it was extended and broadened and in that particular act for the first time included the extension of relief from deportation to people of the criminal and on moral classes.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.906" offset="559543">The petitioner however, does not fall within any of those classes.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.714" offset="590785">What the petitioners sought in connection with this hearing and which was permitted by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.375" offset="629447">Apparently, Congress, it was believed with numerous and many appropriations or petitions by persons for relief from deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.561" offset="674168">The laws prior to the enactments that I spoke of did not provide for any such relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.496" offset="705933">Therefore, Congress did give to the Attorney General of the United States the discretion to recommend and give suspension of deportation to certain classes of aliens who suffered particular hardship.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.522" offset="774060">The petitioner did make such an application.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.741" offset="794958">The special inquiry officer in the Board of Immigration Appeals said that he did not qualify statutorily and for that reason, the Attorney General of the United States could not exercise the discretion that the Congress of the United States had given him.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.049" offset="868101">The Congress of the United States in this particular section and other sections pertaining to suspension deportation had established certain statutory requirements, which had to be met prior to the invocation of the discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.413" offset="945633">Now, Section 244 (a) does provide that the Attorney General under certain circumstances may invoke this discretion and then it proceeds to give five separate and distinct categories or subsections.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.577" offset="1026299">Each of which is separated by the word “or.”</text>
            <text syncTime="262.998" offset="1051899">The first category is separate and distinct from every other category.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.495" offset="1093904">Now, in the course of the deportation hearing, the hearing examiner determine and did lies to the second deportation charge in addition to the charge that the man had entered the United States remained illegally.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.553" offset="1158165">The charge that he had failed to report in January of 1953 and 1954 is required by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.462" offset="1205812">In the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, the Act does contain a charge that anybody who fails to so comply willfully is subject to deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.751" offset="1274984">Section 244 (a) (5) if the relief provision and suspension of deportation does contain therein a portion which said that people who have committed such an act may receive the privilege of suspension of deportation under certain circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.560" offset="1382191">Now, the problem is this and the court below recognized that this man did qualify under the statutory provisions of Section 244 (a) (1), if the statutory provisions of Section 244 (a) (5) were to apply, he would not qualify if they were to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.916" offset="1487621">Our position -- that having qualified under one, he need not qualify under two or more of the same subsections.</text>

            <text syncTime="477.182" offset="1908715">An examination of the record was showed that the Court did make an adjudication that he did qualify.</text>

            <text syncTime="1040.952" offset="4163709">The reason being the Congress wanted it that way, and they so much had said so at the time that they promulgated to statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.581" offset="4206237">Congress said and this the excerpt from the report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.735" offset="4226926">Senate Report 137 81st Congress Session Report, Number 1515 and wherein they made the following recommendation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.821" offset="4275200">The sub committee recommends that the present suspension of deportation provision of the law be abolished within five years and no alien, that means every alien, who entered the United States within a period of two years prior to the enactment of the proposed legislation shall be eligible under the present suspension of deportation provisions of law as modified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.726" offset="4374883">Now, if the Court will examine Section 244 (a) (1), you will notice that as we speak today and since December the 27th, 1957, no one can make application under that section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.807" offset="4447190">In other words, that has died as far as the aliens who entered prior to1950 are concerned and all alliance except for those applications that are pending or under consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.489" offset="4513855">So we see that the congressional intent was that there would be some preservation of the prior suspension of deportation provisions until a certain date.</text>
