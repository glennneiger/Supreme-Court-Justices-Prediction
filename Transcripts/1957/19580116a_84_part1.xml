            <label>Mr. Merrell E. Clark, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="20.281" offset="81084">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.281" offset="93100">This case comes here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.995" offset="123925">The Second Circuit Court had affirmed by a divided court the petitioner's conviction of violation of the narcotics laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.182" offset="172722">The particular statutes involved are listed on Page 2 of petitioner's brief and are printed in the appendix, but they do not raise the question which is really at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.941" offset="231758">Petitioner was tried by a jury in the District Court for the Eastern District of New York, and was convicted of unlawfully selling and conspiring to sell an ounce and a quarter of heroin hydrochloride.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.628" offset="298423">He received a three-year sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.573" offset="314201">Upon appeal, a counsel was assigned by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit through the New York Legal Aid Society.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.947" offset="351713">Now, the fact is that petitioner did participate in that narcotic sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.056" offset="376163">That participation is freely conceded here and was freely conceded on the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.486" offset="405943">The defense was that of entrapment.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.795" offset="423079">In other words, the particular sale of narcotics in which petitioner participated was induced by a Federal agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.680" offset="474697">The question presented here is whether the Trial Court erred in submitting the case to the jury, when the undisputed facts showed, first, the inducement by the document; second, the petitioner had not previously dealt in narcotics, or in fact that he was not a user of narcotics; third, that the urging of the government agents had continued for a period of over two months before the petitioner actually committed the illegal act and fourth, whether the government failed to produce any evidence whatsoever of the inducements first offered to the petitioner and his response thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.525" offset="698096">Now, before turning to the facts I would just like mention one decision of this Court as a sort of background to the facts that is the case of Sorrells versus United States, 287 U.S. 435 (1932).</text>
            <text syncTime="194.859" offset="779389">I mention it, because it is to my knowledge the only occasion on which this Court has spoken on the defense of entrapment, and most of what I will say refers to that case as the touchstone.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.036" offset="836127">In that case this Court first held that entrapment was a valid defense, and the Court said the controlling question, the controlling question is, whether the defendant is a person, otherwise innocent, whom the government is seeking to punish for an alleged offense which is the product of the creative activity of its officials?</text>
            <text syncTime="243.464" offset="973845">Now, the facts are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.561" offset="986175">The narcotic sale we are concerned with took place in Brooklyn on March 2, 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.188" offset="1016686">The purchaser is a man name Marshall, who was a government agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.825" offset="1043226">The actual seller was never apprehended.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.905" offset="1055556">He dealt with Marshall on the telephone, he was never identified, and the government never succeeded in catching him.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.517" offset="1090038">Marshall dealt through a middleman, a man named Seifert.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.836" offset="1111249">I am sorry to bother you with all this dramatic personae, but it is important, a man named Seifert who introduced agent Marshall to the seller over the telephone and who led agent Marshall to the empty lot, where the ounce and a quarter of heroin had been lodged.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.072" offset="1180212">Now, petitioner's role in the transaction was to introduce Marshall, the government agent, to Seifert, the middleman, and that is virtually all he had to do for the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.986" offset="1247922">The story begins chronologically in December 1953, approximately three months before the sale took place when one Kowel appeared in agent Marshall's office and applied for employment as someone familiar with the narcotics business.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.317" offset="1325244">Agent Marshall testified that he hired Kowel as a special employee, paid him on an informal basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.881" offset="1359517">Kowel would come in and say he had spent five or ten dollars in a bar the night before and Marshall would reimburse him.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.018" offset="1384072">But there has been no contention as for the purpose of this case, Kowel was anything but an agent of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.023" offset="1416046">Kowel was also, and had been for some years, a friend of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.143" offset="1440496">Shortly after Kowel's employment by agent Marshall, he suggested to the defendant that the defendant enter the narcotics business.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.475" offset="1501832">He pointed out to the defendant that there was a lot of money to be made in the narcotics business.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.885" offset="1531507">The defendant, as he testified, Kowel himself did not testify, and the only knowledge we have as to this early stage of the story comes from the defendant.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="392.596" offset="1570377">What was the defendant's business?</text>

            <label>Mr. Merrell E. Clark, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="394.131" offset="1576438">The defendant, Your Honor, so far as the record showed, I believe the record doesn't show what his business was, he actually had worked on the waterfront, had been a truck driver, he had two convictions for gambling and one conviction for conspiracy to attempt to commit a robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.257" offset="1660970">But there is no evidence in the record whatsoever, and I believe it's not contended that he had ever dealt in narcotics previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.058" offset="1696183">The defendant testified, as I say his testimony was uncontradicted, that he in the first instance rejected these suggestions.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.922" offset="1723664">He told Kowel he wanted no part in the narcotics business, but Kowel was persistent, repeated his suggestion on two or three separate occasions and finally urged the defendant to meet a big buyer of narcotics from Texas, whom Kowel was going to introduce him to.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.353" offset="1797329">Well, again, the defendant resisted the suggestion, but in the end he consented to meet the big buyer from Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.909" offset="1831602">The meeting took place in Brooklyn on January 14, and as the Court has no doubt surmised, the big buyer from Texas was agent Marshall, and Marshall asked the defendant if he could locate a source of narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.720" offset="1898789">Marshall testified as to this meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.124" offset="1912477">His testimony in substance was that the defendant was willing, expressed willingness to try to locate a source of narcotics for him, boasted that in his gambling contacts he had known in the past at least of people who were in the narcotics business.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.033" offset="1980082">But he told Marshall and Marshall so testified that he did not know right then any source of narcotics, but he undertook to try to find the source.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.926" offset="2019683">Then his testimony, which of course, I think, we must assume the jury disbelieved that he was just stringing Marshall along, but I think for the purpose of this review we must assume that he was actually at that point willing to find a source of narcotics for the buyer from Texas.</text>

            <text syncTime="633.335" offset="2533251">Agent Marshall testified that he spoke to the defendant during that period perhaps ten times, two or three of which were in person, about among other things the defendant's inability to locate a source of narcotics.</text>

            <text syncTime="1940.668" offset="7762651">There is the fact that a government agent sits down with somebody who is into the gambling world and the gambler finds his talk interesting and listens to him, does that show readiness to commit crime, willingness, ready and willing?</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.542" offset="7838093">What is ready and willing mean?</text>

            <text syncTime="1979.974" offset="7919804">He said that Masciale told me he is primarily a gambler that he is not a narcotics trafficker as such, but that he knew the right people, that he had a very good source which could supply me with an excellent quality of heroine, but somehow he had had a falling out with him, and that he knew someone he considered high in the narcotics traffic to whom he could introduce me, and that I was able to get 88% pure heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.588" offset="8046341">It is much further than just sitting down and having an accidental conversation in which he mentions the man's name where he might able to get it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2027.669" offset="8110602">The question that I ask you is because I think to me it makes a lot of difference whether you are to imply into the statute a limitation by Congress that it is not making it a crime for a man who does not shut up of a government agent who talks about his businesses.</text>

            <text syncTime="2052.112" offset="8208405">I am not interested, but listens to what might be very interesting tale and gets interested although there is no antecedent proof that that man was going to embark upon that kind of business except by the enticement of an agent or whether you take the view of Justice Roberts' concurring opinion that this is shabby business for the government to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.585" offset="8298266">It makes all the difference in the world I think to me whether this is an implied exception in the statute or that this is the kind of a thing that should not be encouraged by having the government go in the business of having people commit crimes who vouch for their activity when they are committing it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2193.364" offset="8773381">I am suggesting that it may make a difference whether you would take the ground on which the court, you rightly say the court, I prefer to say a court instead of majority, the majority makes the court, what you take the ground of the court in recognizing entrapment and saving a defendant or of the court or that you take the view of the Robert's view, to me it makes a difference.</text>

            <text syncTime="2222.310" offset="8889156">I understand Your Honor and I think I understand the reason, because if the position of the majority and of the court has a final say is that it is no offense, it is a not guilty plea and it is showing in which you are entitled to finding not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.884" offset="8963448">He did not commit it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.484" offset="8969927">And in that respect, the Sorrells case, those it seems to me the courts did not bother whether he is entrapped or not is not simply what was done, what was asked, but what was his mental process at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.673" offset="9042651">Was he a person who was otherwise innocent who would not have ever committed this or ever done this thing if it had not been brought out and suggested and induced and incited by the government?</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.370" offset="9093433">Now when we get to that question of what was his mental process at the time the only way we can ever tell is by the evidence and by what the factual situation is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.886" offset="9147455">Here in this case how do we tell his mental process, by what he said, his willingness to go along with it.</text>
