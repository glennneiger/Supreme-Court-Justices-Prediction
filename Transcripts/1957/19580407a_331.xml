            <text syncTime="646.231" offset="2584869">They say that they do not read the opinion of the trial judge upon which the Court of Appeals affirmed as justifying the conclusion that the raid was made or the seizure was made for the purpose of going in there without going in to make an arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.296" offset="2653100">But the way I read it, of course, it -- it seems to me clear, one way or the other that they did go in and that they had a probable cause and they had submission time to procure one.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.723" offset="2690821">I raised this pointed, if -- if the Court please, that when the officers or the agents went to Gainesville to procure the daylight search warrant, that they had the probable cause at that time, whether they were going in for the purpose of -- of seizing the distillery or arresting the petitioner because of the probable cause that they had to arrest him, they could have, at that time, have procured a warrant to arrest him if that probable cause exists at that time and the Government contends that it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.448" offset="2809731">But they did not, at any time, attempt to procure a warrant to arrest or to search with the exception of the daylight search warrant that they did actually procure.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.888" offset="2847451">Now, the trial judge in his -- in his findings of fact -- now, we -- there's no question but what there were a sufficient number of officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.443" offset="2913698">And the trial judge said that although the officers had ample opportunity to execute the daylight search warrant during the daylight hours, they did not do so but desiring to see as any vehicles engaged in removing the illicit liquors, they did not immediately execute the daylight search warrant but remained on watching until after dark until about 9 o'clock p.m.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.579" offset="3010247">And this, I believe, would answer Your Honor's question that at that time, the officers attempt to gain entrance in the dwelling of Roy Jones who was not at home at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.464" offset="3045773">Mrs.Jones attempted to block the doorway requesting the officers to wait until the husband arrives.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.940" offset="3067716">And at that time, a 12-year old son of the appellant obtained a shotgun and held it in a threatening manner in an attempt to keep the officers from searching the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.794" offset="3103138">Mrs. Jones asked the officer if he had a search warrant, and he stated that he did not need one.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.772" offset="3122991">In other words, she specifically did ask, according to the record, for a search warrant.</text>
