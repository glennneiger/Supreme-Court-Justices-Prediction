            <text syncTime="9.584" offset="38243">Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.540" offset="70113">When we rose for lunch, I was discussing the question of interpretation of the federal reclamation law.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.292" offset="105117">And I was addressing myself to the problem of reconciling the two provisions in the reclamation law, one of which says that the Secretary of Interior shall proceed in accordance with state law and the other which says that none of -- no project water shall be distributed to acreage exceeding 160 acres in one -- one ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.081" offset="224235">And the problem which is before the Court is to determine whether which one -- which of these provisions shouldn't affect, prevail or whether they can both prevail in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.004" offset="295915">I think it's made easier in this case because of the fact that the California law in the federal cooperation law specifically states that project water received by irrigation districts shall be distributed in accordance with the acts of Congress and rules and -- applicable laws of Congress and rules and regulations thereunder.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.559" offset="398211">But in any event, I believe that the specific provision for 160-acre limitation must prevail over the more general provision which deals primarily with methods of appropriating water and in this case, of course, the Secretary of Interior, the Bureau of Reclamation has achieved its water rights through the state procedures of -- of proper appropriation.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.754" offset="534988">Unfortunately, as far as the Central Valley Project is concerned, whatever the interpretation we might otherwise give to the statutes, subsequent actions in Congress make it clear that Congress intends the 160-acre limitation to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.646" offset="634567">In both 1944 and 1945, specific acts were introduced in Congress to exempt the Central Valley Project from the 160-acre limitation and extensive hearings were held on this matter and in both cases, Congress refused to pass the statutes which would provide the exemption.</text>

            <text syncTime="196.831" offset="787226">I will say that bills were passed and those were the Appropriation Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.876" offset="815438">The Secretary of Interior reported to Congress time and time again with respect to these specific contracts and this specific problem of a 160-acre limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.455" offset="873744">And Congress, with this -- with this information before them, proceeded to appropriate in the neighborhood of $400 million for the carrying of the project.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.127" offset="928496">And I may say also with respect to the Santa Barbara Project that a companion project where the water was to be delivered through underground sources to what the reclamation project was specifically designed to replenish underground water.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.747" offset="1006968">Congress specifically in that case exempted the project from a 160-acre limitation and for the very easy reason that no one could distinguish between project water and non-project water when it was drawn out through wells.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.047" offset="1064124">But the fact that Congress would specifically exempt this California Project from a 160-acre limitation would be an indication that when they didn't exempt it, they meant it to apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="988.895" offset="3955566">The first question of course is whether they're taking anything from them since then refusing to deliver water but they are not preventing them from getting water from any other source which they might want to get it, but passing that question which is essentially a state question we come to this proposition which I think this Court has passed on very explicitly and that is that the United States, if it is taking a right is not necessarily unconstitutionally taking the right because we have the right of eminent domain and we would have to pay them for any rights which we are taking from them, which are -- which are vested and which they probably state should be compensated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.553" offset="4126198">I say that the courts decided upon that and I refer the case to the Court of the United States against Gerlach whether in the same reclamation project, the United States in cutting off the flow of the river deprived some of the downstream holders of certain irrigation benefits which they got from the flooding, the river flooding over their lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.550" offset="4226194">And in that case, it was held that it was -- the Court held that this was a vested right, a right which was vested in those California owners, but it didn't say the United States had no right to take it.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harry W. Horton</label>
            <text syncTime="1318.360" offset="5273391">Mr. Chief Justice and Associate Justices, counsel for the appellees held and I hope with your consent, divided their arguments into three parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.501" offset="5333995">I'll take approximately 30 minutes on the -- of the two counsel approximately the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.966" offset="5363775">The portion of the case that I would like to discuss with your permission deals with the historical fact, the record and background of this case, so that with that in mind, we may first discuss the question of jurisdiction and my argument will be directed very largely if not entirely to the question of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.797" offset="5483102">The historical background of the Central Valley Project is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.424" offset="5509642">That in 1850, when California became a State, a statute was passed leading to an investigation of the impounding of waters in the northern areas and they've taken them to the areas where there was less water in the southern portion of the San Joaquin Valley and also portions of the Sacramento.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.183" offset="5612669">Those studies continued by legislative enactment over a -- an extended period of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.168" offset="5652584">The interest in that as a State endeavor was evidenced by the fact that in one year, when the legislature forgot to make an appropriation, the Chambers of Commerce of the city of San Francisco and also of the city of Los Angeles raised $100,000 to provide the engineering staff of funds to continue the work as a state project.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.633" offset="5754462">By 1913, it was realized that the system of water rights that existed in California which at that -- up to that time has been one of merely going out and starting a diversion works in building a canal or after 1872, posting a notice and recording a notice that that system was not what should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.256" offset="5868983">And in 1913, they passed what was known as The Water Commission Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.614" offset="5894374">In that act, the existing rights were validated and recognized and the procedure which now exist in California was set up under the Water Commission Act which is the filing of an application with the state engineer now the division of water resource -- Department of Water Resources and the proper division of it under which permits are issued of which are subject to certain degrees of discretion within the state engineers as to whether for that water shall be taken and the quantities that maybe used and whether or not the use and purpose proposed is a proper one under the state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.616" offset="6094367">In 1921, the plan had proceeded far enough that in that year the legislature provided for what they called a state plan and further the studies on the basis of the state plan that encompassed a greater area than the San Joaquin and the -- and the Sacramento Valleys.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.500" offset="6193946">By 1927, the State realized the fact that the Water Law of California was primarily that of appropriation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.048" offset="6244101">And therefore, passed a statute which was not to direct free but mandatory in which required the Director of Finance of the State of California to file on all of the inappropriated waters of the State of California that might be necessary for any of these projects under this proposed state plan and in particular with reference to the Central Valley Project which was even at that time taking shape.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.389" offset="6365518">Those filings were made by the Director of Finance in 1927 and we are interested in this case only on the filings on the San Joaquin River and incidentally on the filings of the Sacramento River because the water for these districts comes from the Friant Dam and the canal that comes to the Madera District from the Friant Dam and the canal that comes from Friant Dam through the area to the south and to the Ivanhoe District.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.962" offset="6499788">So, what we're concerned with are those -- are those particular filings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.654" offset="6522567">Filing the -- following the enactment of that legislation and the making of those filings in due form, the legislature took the next step and in 1933, created what was known as the Water Project Authority of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.962" offset="6603755">Now, that agency was created as a body politic of the State of California with power to sue and be sued in what's certain definite mandatory duties and certain discretionary duties, but their primary function was to build and construct and operate and maintain the Central Valley Project.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.412" offset="6689646">At the same time of the creation of the Water Project Authority, the legislature created by definition the Central Valley Project.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.467" offset="6737816">Following the organization or the creation of the Water Project Authority, that organization picked up the work that had previously been done and prepared a plan in detail, an engineering plan in detail of where this water was to be taken and what areas were to be served.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.329" offset="6837290">And in that particular plan, both by description and by reference to a map contained in the document itself, the Ivanhoe District which had not yet been formed but the area of it defined and designated on the map was drawn out as an area to be served under these filings that had been made by the director of finance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.898" offset="6943556">The Madera District was already in -- in existence but it was also encompassed by description on also upon these maps as one of the areas to be served from the Friant Dam and from the Madera Canal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.861" offset="7011370">Now, following the next step -- the next one was the effort on the part of the Water Project Authority to proceed to construct the Central Valley Project of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.328" offset="7069257">The Act authorized the authority to issue $170 million in bonds which at that time was the estimated cost of the works that were encompassed within the Central Valley Project.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.956" offset="7127771">The bond market was not favorable due to the depression and the Water Project Authority came to Washington and filed with the reconstruction finance corporation an application for a loan on grant if you obtain the money so that the Water Project Authority might proceed with the construction under the statutes and the duty that was imposed upon it by that state legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.130" offset="7240516">The application was received and favorably acted upon until somebody suggested that it might be a lot easier to get the money under the works progress authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.071" offset="7292238">And so, the first appropriation that was made, not as a loan on grant, but in the interest of employment during the depression was the advancement of $12 million on the order of the President to start the work on this project.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.505" offset="7373949">The Bureau of Reclamation was assigned as the agency to do the actual construction work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.532" offset="7406028">And the bureau opened an office in Sacramento, California to start work on the project itself using the engineering data, the designs, the plans and the specifications and the details that had been proffered for the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.341" offset="7481260">As they came in to California, the Water Project Authority entered into a series of contracts with the Bureau of Reclamation for certain engineering services which they were to render and also the contracts contained a provision that it was the intention of the parties that a contract be made within a reasonable period of time between the United States and the Water Project Authority whereby the Water Project Authority would proceed with the arrangements necessary for the distribution of the water and the collection of the revenues from that distribution of the waters and the repayment to the United States Government of the amount of money that it might invest in the project.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.282" offset="7689091">That contract ran on for a period of time in an effort on the part of the officials of the State of California including the then Governor of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.772" offset="7743007">They tried to get the contract that was provided for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.500" offset="7765995">And I think it was Governor Rolph, if I'm not mistaken who wrote letters to the Secretary of the Interior and getting no results from the letters, finally sent telegrams which finally culminated in a meeting, two meetings in fact one, in San Francisco and one in Sacramento, in which the Governor then demanded that the United States live up to its agreement that its entry into the Central Valley Project of California would be as a construction agency and so that the Water Project Authority of California created by its legislator and imposed with the duty not a discretionary duty but imposed with the duty to construct, operate and maintain and collect the revenue from this project, might proceed with its work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.543" offset="7970168">The result of that conference was a flat refusal by a representative of the Department of Interior to even consider any participation on the part of the Water Project Authority in connection with making any contracts or having anything to do with the distribution of this water and the State was specifically advised, as I say the State, the Water Project Authority of California was specifically advised, that they were not to have anything to do with that phase of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.490" offset="8105900">The matter then proceeded for a few years with a impasse of that character.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.808" offset="8135158">And finally, the Bureau of Reclamation proposed certain contracts which they circulated to various irrigation districts within the Central Valley Project.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.552" offset="8186149">Those contracts are or generally in a formal rather modified in some particulars, but generally in the form of the Ivanhoe contract which we can take as an exemplar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.701" offset="8242782">Questioning of the local officials of the Bureau of Reclamation give us very little light on one of the things that we were particularly interested in and that is what was this 9 (e) contract?</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.820" offset="8299207">We were told that it was a contract by which water would be delivered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.489" offset="8317910">We asked questions as to what water right does the district have?</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.150" offset="8332539">What water right does the landowner have under that contract?</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.078" offset="8352287">We could not get a definite answer until we finally came back to Washington and then the conference with the Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of Reclamation, we were finally advised of the fact that this 9 (e) contract was a new type, a new thought in reclamation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.555" offset="8430132">It was a contract by which the Government was going to deliver water as a utility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.337" offset="8461270">The gentlemen in the Bureau of Reclamation and the Department of Interior gave the name which followed through on these contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.105" offset="8496379">It is a utility type contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.522" offset="8518008">Under the law, they said they could not recognize a water right in the landowner or the district beyond the period of 40 years and at the end of it, there could be no agreement implied or expressed that they would renew the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.457" offset="8581747">The next question we raised will now -- ordinarily under the reclamation law when the payments are made upon a contract there are some indication of how much you're going to pay and when you were done in the payment of it and that had a twofold place in the case for the reason that under one provision of the reclamation laws when half of the cost to be repaid by the farmer or paid the acreage limitation is no longer applicable under another Section of the Reclamation Act when the full amount is paid off, it is payable by agriculture, the acreage limitation is no longer applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.581" offset="8750289">So we ask, when do we know and by what yardstick do we know of the credit and we were told it is not a repayment contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.145" offset="8800549">There is no obligation on the part of the United States to give you credit for what you have paid and the United States has the right in perpetuity to continue to charge for water above all and then and even take that money and use it to construct another project elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.075" offset="8892291">Well gentlemen, I think you can realize that both of us in the west are used to billing with water on the basis of the fact that it is a pertinent for the land that the water right is permanent as the basis of our economy when you're confronted with that sort of a situation, we were completely dumbfounded because of the impact to format on your land, your value, what have you, the answer -- the soft answer if I may characterize it as such that was given to us is that, well do you think that the United States Government would take the water from an existing project and move it to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.274" offset="9057071">Well, we found in the record inquiries made by some of the Congressmen to the officials of the Bureau of the Reclamation of the fact that they asserted the right to do just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.719" offset="9114854">And consequently, we were effaced with that sort of a situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.076" offset="9140245">Now, so far as the acreage limitation proposition that is merely an incident that is used as the big talking point by the appellants in this case because of the fact that it may have a popular appeal and I am not doing that to be critical of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.078" offset="9220284">We can see that to be an incidental fact and that the water right situation as the predominant factor that we're interested in preserving.</text>

            <text syncTime="2561.412" offset="10245642">But whatever these waters are that whether in the State of California, wherever they may be, that is of no moment who owns them, whether the State of California or an irrigation district or a private owner owns them because they conceive of some overriding federal power possibly constitutional, probably not, that says that they can take these waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.597" offset="10350341">Now, they say that they have to pay for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.050" offset="10364134">But the end of their argument is this, not that they have to condemn them but all they have to do is walk in and take possession in there and if for chance, the landowner or the person having the right, doesn't bring his suit with any time or doesn't file an injunction proceeding to stop them from going ahead until they have followed the orderly process of condemnation that then they're securing that right, that's the end result of the type of right that they're talking about and I'm not talking about that kind of a right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.208" offset="10504777">I'm not arguing that the United States might not, under constitutional powers, and under some congressional direction which I don't think exists today, come in and condemn all the water rights of individuals within the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="2661.457" offset="10645734">When these contracts were presented, they finally reached -- a -- a point where they had to be submitted to the District Securities Commission of the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.524" offset="10690038">Now, that is the agency of the State of California had created, five members occupying official positions within the State whose job is to approve or reject these contracts and bonds that the districts may be offering.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.824" offset="10771226">And their function is to determine the feasibility from an operating standpoint of financial feasibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.062" offset="10808216">And when these contracts came before the District Securities Commission of California as is evidenced by the order in the Ivanhoe case, the Commission took the position that these contracts with respect to acreage limitation and with respect to water rights were not desirable contracts but took the position that the function of the Securities Commission was not judicial and that they should pass that on to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.777" offset="10927020">And that conditional order, so that it might go on was then made by the District Securities Commission with the admonition of their disagreement with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.568" offset="10966204">Disagreement being on legal grounds and also upon practical grounds of the impossibility and impracticability of the enforcement and application of the acreage limitation and the fact that the water rights which to us are sacred and must be in perpetuity and must be a pertinent to your land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.752" offset="11074978">After that had been done, the Attorney General of the State of California rendered an opinion on the question of the validity under California law of the very Act that the appellants were referred to, to what would they called the Federal Cooperation Act which is they act if they say gives irrigation districts authority to sign a contract to distribute water in any manner provided for by the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.618" offset="11210397">The Attorney General of California determined in that opinion that the Federal Cooperation Act insofar as that imposed or -- or insofar as that gave authority to an irrigation district to discriminate among its landowners in the quantity of land that they could own was an invalid Act under the law of State of California having no uniformity of -- of application and that it violated the provisions of the California Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.506" offset="11357936">The next up in the procedure was the filing of the -- of the validation suit by Ivanhoe which was followed by the Madera case.At the time that that came up, the Attorney General of California joined in the case voluntarily upon the basis of the invalidity of the contract as seen by the Attorney General then on two bases, one, the question of the water right and two, the question of the acreage limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.562" offset="11498162">The case was about ready to proceed to trial when the new Attorney General came in and asked leave to file an amended answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.785" offset="11547063">In that amended answer, the Attorney General set up the fact that the water within the State of California was the property of the State of California held in trust for the State of California for the benefit of the users.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.467" offset="11617802">Now, there is much in the briefs and something has been said in oral argument condemning of our Supreme Court of California for its reference to the so-called trust theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.664" offset="11682586">If you will turn to the portions of the amended answer of the State of California in this record, you will find that the State of California itself through its present counsel were the ones that planned the trust theory and also alleged that the filings by the director of finance upon these waters were such of such a nature as to give to these people within these districts to be served, a water right which was held was in trust for the benefit of those landowners and of those districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.259" offset="11848934">Following that and before, the California Supreme Court had passed upon the appeal before it the Attorney General of California wrote another opinion having to do with relative water rights between certain areas in California in which he characterized the holding of these water rights by the State as being held in trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.578" offset="11970247">And I do want to call to your attention the fact that this whole trust theory and the very unkind language contained in the briefs of the appellants in this case which are charged to the California Supreme Court stem from their own pleadings and their own opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.957" offset="12047778">And I think it comes with an ill grace under that circumstance for them to take that position as to the California Supreme Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3228.861" offset="12915357">The California Supreme Court said with respect to the acreage limitation is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.838" offset="12943256">That legislation in California must be uniform, a general legislation and it must be of uniform application.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.065" offset="12980245">Counsel has said that the California Supreme Court nowhere has cited, Section 11 of Article 1 of the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.052" offset="13012114">But if he will take a look at the case of the city of Pasadena versus Stimson that was cited for the California Court in page -- turn to -- I've forgotten the page now, in it you'll see that they did refer to that plus one other section of the California Constitution, Section 25 of Article 4, Subdivision 33 which is to the same general tenor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.667" offset="13122664">So apparently, counsel hasn't even read the case of Pasadena against Stimson because that is the case that's specifically tied after the California Constitution and no other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.876" offset="13163416">Now, what the California Court said was that an irrigation district in the State of California could not -- or rather let me put it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.102" offset="13212317">That the legislature of the State of California could not pass legislation which would authorize an irrigation district to discriminate in the delivery of water regardless of its source -- didn't make any difference where this word came from, on the basis to how many acres of the land the man owns.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.913" offset="13295595">And they said they not only did not do it and if they had tried to do it, and that was the language in the fact, it was invalid, and the further and more pointed proposition was that the legislature of California had passed the validation Act which purported to validate all previous contracts and the California Supreme Court said at page 59 of its decision as contained in the jurisdictional statement that they couldn't have passed an Act in specific language authorizing an irrigation district to discriminate between its landowners and deliver water on the basis of the amount of acres that a man owns.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.332" offset="13465287">So, insofar as the acreage limitation, it's a pure and simple proposition that the California Court has said what California law is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.703" offset="13498723">They weren't even discussing federal law at that stage of the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3434.603" offset="13738318">What the California Court in my opinion held was this.That if the California legislature said that irrigation districts may deliver water only to persons who do not own 160-acre land that was of general application over the entire State, we'd have one question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.060" offset="13824209">Now here, what they held was that the legislature couldn't say that an irrigation district could do that as simply as the people who might have had a contract that was carried.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.608" offset="13874364">Now, they didn't put that on the basis of federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.271" offset="13885022">They put that on the basis solely of the power of the legislature in the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.938" offset="13907696">Now, I want to comment on another situation on jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.527" offset="13926087">In the Government code and we've cited this in our brief, the legislature of the State of California in connection with the acquisition of property by the Federal Government in the United States has reserved to itself by specific legislation, the right, power and jurisdiction to administer the waters within the State of California and that happened in 1955, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.878" offset="14015425">That is cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.742" offset="14022949">Now, may I take a moment to go to this question of water?</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.161" offset="14044578">We have a -- an extended hearing on the question of what California water law was and as to whether or not the filings by the director of finance of these applications to appropriate coupled with the succeeding events of the construction of the works and everything else vested in these landowners, ex-district and the landowners therein a water right that was existent and was in the nature of a real property right that it was entitled to protection by injunction and other proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.828" offset="14187311">So there, the Court passed on that, said that there was a right under the California water line and all they did was accept what have been said by this Court in the Gerlach case to the effect that the Section 8 of the Reclamation Act of 1922 was applicable and as my co-counsel will point out to you, Congress has reiterated that in 1952 and reiterated it in 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.834" offset="14295249">I'm sorry that I don't have more time to -- to hit this jurisdictional question.</text>

            <text syncTime="3587.032" offset="14348121">I will say a little something about jurisdiction in passing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.820" offset="14367242">I would like tostart off as I had intended to anyway, by picking up Justice Frankfurter's question as to what is involved here by way of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.633" offset="14414472">Now, I share with Mr. Davis' desire to simplify the issues here.And it seems to me the simplest starting point in the world is the provision of the 1926 Federal Statute which provides that the Bureau of Reclamation shall proceed solely by way of contract, no regulatory power, solely by way of contract, contract with whom?</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.574" offset="14518230">This is the 1926 Federal Act with irrigation districts organized under state law, and that the contract shall be subjected to validation in judicial proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.502" offset="14577998">Now, answering a question which Justice Douglas put earlier, the Bureau of Reclamation itself has always construed the 1926 Act to require validation proceedings in state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.603" offset="14630348">And the Ivanhoe contract, the provision in point appearing in the record at 4142, provides that the district shall go ahead, start validation proceedings and appeal the case, if necessary to what Court?</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.856" offset="14683324">To the highest Court of the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.399" offset="14697535">So I say it comes down to this that the Federal Government, by its own election, has elected to proceed by way of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.233" offset="14724911">Its -- it takes two to make a bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.409" offset="14733584">The federal law says nothing about the -- the authority of a state irrigation district.</text>
            <text syncTime="3688.549" offset="14754168">It leaves that entirely up to the state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3690.894" offset="14763572">So that on jurisdiction, whether this Court has jurisdiction to review or not, whether a federal question is presented or not in the last analysis or maybe in the first analysis, it all goes back to what are the powers of an irrigation district under California law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3806.504" offset="15225940">At page 35 of the brief of the United States, in this case, the sentence appears, and I -- I hope the Court will listen to it carefully, “The California Court has now determined that the 160-acre limitation and the repayment provisions of the contracts are inconsistent with state law, requiring the proportion of distribution of water for irrigation, California Water Code Section 22250, and the right of landowners to receive irrigation water.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3835.386" offset="15341505">That closes the quotation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3836.931" offset="15347670">Now, that's exactly, of course, our position and has been since last June.</text>
            <text syncTime="3842.658" offset="15370553">The Government brief then on the same page goes on to argue that the Supreme Court of California was not free under federal law to apply state law because they say federal law somehow has occupied the field, although that's not their exact expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="3861.189" offset="15444741">And they say that the Federal Government, I'm referring to the United States' brief, has the power to impose, and I quote the words “to impose” the disputed contractual provisions now, where it issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3874.064" offset="15496255">What they're saying is, that we don't care what the Supreme Court of California thought were said.</text>

            <text syncTime="3959.269" offset="15836996">It's imposing something by force of -- of avow.</text>
            <text syncTime="3962.570" offset="15850266">Now, what did Congress intend here?</text>
            <text syncTime="3965.023" offset="15860088">As has been brought out, there is a question of -- of reconciliation if -- if possible, this Section 5 of the original act, Section 7 which deals with condemnation, and Section 8 which talks about the inviolability of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3979.134" offset="15916513">And I think those all can be reconciled and a key point to the reconciliation is the fact that I mentioned at the outset, that the Federal Government, the Congress has elected to proceed by way of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3992.105" offset="15968340">I think contract perhaps is the most important word in this whole litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3996.386" offset="15985476">Now, Section 8, which has been on the books since 1902, says that nothing in the act, and I now quote, “Shall be construed as affecting or intended to affect or to in any way interfere with the laws of any State or territory relating to the control, appropriation, use, or distribution of water used in irrigation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4020.018" offset="16080039">That is still on the books and it has been reaffirmed verbatim by the Congress as late as 1956 in the Act of July 2nd, Section 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="4030.506" offset="16121940">Likewise, it's consistent with this federal concern about leaving to state jurisdiction, the matter of water for irrigation is the Act of July 10, 1952, never much mentioned by the Government which provides that in any case where the United States is joined as a party involving state water rights, the United States, and I now quote, “Shall be deemed to have waived any right to plead that the state laws are inapplicable or that the United States is not amenable thereto by reason of its sovereignty.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4062.457" offset="16249731">Now, there are many other statutes which we discussed in our brief all and the same thing, all showing that so far as irrigation is concerned, Congress wants to leave that up to the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4069.435" offset="16277734">So far as appropriation, control, use, or distribution of the waters are concerned, the navigational servitude, I might add right here, is not involved in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4083.523" offset="16334054">Nobody contends that it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="4085.549" offset="16342100">Now, the decisions of this Court are summarized in our brief, our main brief, page 55 to 60, and every decision which has dealt with Section 8 of the Reclamation Act has given that section full force and the effect without qualification.</text>
            <text syncTime="4104.953" offset="16419736">We discussed in our brief, Mr. Chief Justice, used his opinion in the Mason Tax -- Company against Tax Commission which involved the building of the Grand Coulee Dam on the Columbia River.</text>
            <text syncTime="4115.151" offset="16460591">We discussed in our brief the California Oregon Power Company against the Beaver Cement Company case which dealt with Oregon, their water law reserving with the State the right to cut down riparian rights of a grantee of the United States.We discussed Ickes against Fox, Nebraska against Wyoming in which the opinion was written by Justice Douglas and finally, the Gerlach case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4137.209" offset="16548780">Now, Ickes against Fox which dealt with a reclamation problem uses language which I think is so important that I should call the Court's attention to it as expressing -- pressed as I am for time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4152.872" offset="16611474">In that case, which came up on the pleadings to this Court crucial to the decision was the following language of this Court and I'm going to quote from page 57 of our brief, that's 300 U.S.at pages 94, 95.</text>
            <text syncTime="4167.233" offset="16668839">Here's what this Court said, “Although the Government diverted, stored, and distributed the water, the contention of petitioner that thereby ownership of the water or water rights became vested in the United States is not well founded.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4183.492" offset="16733936">Appropriation was made not for the use of the Government but under the reclamation law for the use of the landowners and by the terms of the law and of the contract already referred to, the water rights became the property of the landowners wholly distinct and also if the Court would note this language, wholly distinct from the property right of the Government in the irrigation works.</text>

            <text syncTime="4220.009" offset="16880013">In Ickes against Fox, this Court on the pleadings held that -- held that there was a justiciable issue and sent the matter back for trial when it was claimed that the Secretary of the Interior unlawfully was attempting to take water from one, Washington Irrigation District and give it to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="4236.164" offset="16944588">Now again, the Gerlach case referred to this very important water amendment in the California Constitution which the court below referred to, adopted in 1928.</text>
            <text syncTime="4247.857" offset="16991399">And the Gerlach opinion of this Court referred to this 1928 amendment as and I now quote, “That California's basic water law to which the Federal Reclamation Act defers.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4262.894" offset="17051481">Now, if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="4265.646" offset="17062557">The Bureau of Reclamation has largely proceeded in a constricted form -- largely proceeded in constricted form in view of this Section 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="4273.829" offset="17095262">They have told Congress, yes, about what they were doing under acreage limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4277.881" offset="17111458">In the same breadth, they have assured Congress that they were respecting state law when it came to the appropriation, control, use, and distribution of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="4287.829" offset="17151269">There's something here that they never reconciled in their own reports to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="4292.478" offset="17169868">We quote it in our brief, the Gerlach opinion of this Court, quotes verbatim, “two sets of assurances given to Congress by the Secretary of -- of Agriculture.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4301.501" offset="17205917">In the record in this case, at page 101, there's a copy of a letter written by the Secretary of the Interior, then Mr. Chapman, to Attorney General Brown, in which he assures Attorney General Brown that the United States will only obtain its water pursuant to California law by appropriation and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="4320.208" offset="17280731">Now, our brief mentioned something rather interesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="4322.743" offset="17290971">A hearing at Fresno, California before the California State Water Rights Board that hearing in Fresno is going on right this minute, allowing for the -- the difference of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4332.777" offset="17331096">It's going on today.</text>
            <text syncTime="4334.654" offset="17338514">And in that hearing, the United States of America acting by the Bureau of Reclamation, under California law, is processing its applications to appropriate California waters for the Central Valley Project.</text>
            <text syncTime="4348.151" offset="17392536">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4348.710" offset="17394834">That's all that they've done.</text>
            <text syncTime="4350.325" offset="17401208">And what kind of an order will that State Board issue?</text>
            <text syncTime="4352.848" offset="17411344">We have copies of the orders in our briefs.It will say, “Yes, you may have the water.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4357.656" offset="17430570">But the owners of the water will be the -- the landowners, the users, and the state district and you must proceed in conformity with state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4367.396" offset="17469544">And the Bureau of Reclamation accepts, permits on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="4371.276" offset="17485009">Now, in this -- in the opinion on the Gerlach case, this Court said something which I think that has application here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4380.058" offset="17520222">The Gerlach opinion observed that the Bureau of Reclamation, and I quote, “Has at all times pursued a course impossible to reconcile with the present contentions of the Government,” meaning, the Department of Justices' position in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4396.752" offset="17586991">Now, I'm not trying to score any debating point whoever said what, when or what not is essentially unimportant, but I do submit to the Court that the statement of this Court in the Gerlach case applies here because I think some of the arguments made in the Government's brief in this case would give one no inkling.</text>
            <text syncTime="4413.407" offset="17653551">That's the very time that this was written.</text>
            <text syncTime="4415.900" offset="17663582">The Bureau is going ahead under state law in California to appropriate state waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="4422.496" offset="17689913">Now, let me go ahead and turn to appellants here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4428.871" offset="17715409">In our main brief here, we chided, gently I think, the appellants for not discussing these various decisions of this Court which ruled upon the force of Section 8; the Tax Commission Case, the Beaver Cement case, Ickes against Fox, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="4452.522" offset="17810077">And the -- the issue was squarely joined between all of United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4455.444" offset="17821675">I think, at almost every point in their reply, appellants with -- certainly with candor said, “No, we didn't discuss the case just because in our view, they are irrelevant.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4468.232" offset="17872875">That was the word they used.</text>
            <text syncTime="4470.957" offset="17883742">Now, to me, it's breathtaking that those cases winding up for the Gerlach case that it could be considered by anybody as irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4479.716" offset="17918851">This is a water case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4481.251" offset="17924911">The decision of this Court has said that state law controls among other things, distribution of the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="4486.938" offset="17947690">Our friends say the cases are irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4489.790" offset="17959079">Well, what's their -- what's their reasoning?</text>
            <text syncTime="4491.487" offset="17965871">What's their argument here?</text>
            <text syncTime="4494.699" offset="17978723">They don't seem to deny that the United States, if it wants to get the water for a project, must appropriate under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4502.681" offset="18010697">But they say having appropriated under state law and having, going -- gone through all these forms such as the going out at Fresno today.</text>
            <text syncTime="4509.019" offset="18035984">And even though the title to the water it receives from the State is in trust or subject to limitations, once the United States gets its hands on the water, then it's free of all State restrictions and could obtain a title greater than any other person can obtain in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="4525.621" offset="18102439">But, of course, I suppose the immediate response is if that is true, why go through all of the monkey business of appropriating under state law in the first place?</text>

            <text syncTime="4657.079" offset="18628232">How can they -- how can our friends argue that, yes, you have to appropriate one way but you can always -- then you claim a higher title than you get.</text>
            <text syncTime="4664.891" offset="18659474">Well, it -- it seems to depend largely upon the theory that under the Reclamation Act, the United States has the power of condemnation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4675.309" offset="18701166">So they say, “Well, let's not fuss around about what kind of title we get.</text>
            <text syncTime="4678.750" offset="18714958">After all, we in the United States is that we can always condemn.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4683.560" offset="18734184">Power of eminent domain solves all the problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="4685.965" offset="18743798">You heard Mr. Davis concerning that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4687.851" offset="18751321">It's developed very fully in the brief for the appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="4691.774" offset="18766994">Well now, this is ingenious, but can it commend itself to this Court?</text>
            <text syncTime="4696.323" offset="18785280">Now, if it does, it -- it has unlimited possibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4699.245" offset="18796878">Every challenge is to government regulation where property is involved whether it is the challenge be the Federal Government, state, local.</text>
            <text syncTime="4706.679" offset="18826658">It can always be turned into a condemnation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4709.084" offset="18836271">And the Government says, “Well, we haven't yet proceeded to condemn.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4711.447" offset="18845780">They haven't here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4712.755" offset="18851004">But after all, we have the power of condemnation and therefore, don't worry.</text>
            <text syncTime="4716.555" offset="18866155">Just to let us regulate you.</text>
            <text syncTime="4717.943" offset="18871693">And if you think that you have any recourse, go to the Court of Claims or go to somewhere else in some other proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4724.478" offset="18897816">But, of course, that that can't be reconciled with Section 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="4728.488" offset="18913907">There's plenty of place consistent with Section 8, consistent with state jurisdiction over waters for eminent domain, plenty of places for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4737.431" offset="18949642">The Government had that power when it built the Friant-Kern Canal and probably exercised it when you get some of the land for the canal purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4744.447" offset="18977750">It's a useful power and it's perfectly reconcilable with Section 8 without using the power of eminent domain to completely obliterate the powers reserved to the States under Section 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="4755.658" offset="19022576">And likewise, Section 5, the 160-acre limitation is consistent with Section 8 so long as it's understood that the acreage limitation may be applied when it's consistent and permitted by state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4772.335" offset="19089241">And, of course, that ties it as -- buttressed by the fact that the Government here has elected to proceed by way of contract with state-created irrigation districts, without making any effort to endow those districts with authority leaving that to the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="4789.725" offset="19158831">Now, I should proceed, I think, with the question which to me is as serious.</text>
            <text syncTime="4796.661" offset="19186625">Suppose as it has not done, Congress had never enacted Section 8, had never decided to proceed by way of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="4804.388" offset="19217450">Suppose that Congress as it has not, had simply said, “All right, so we have lots of money and we'll get more.</text>
            <text syncTime="4811.380" offset="19245453">We're going to come in to California and we're going to run these works and distribute water on our terms and you're going to take it on our terms.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4820.605" offset="19282338">Would that be constitutional under our Federal Constitution, and we say no.</text>
            <text syncTime="4826.692" offset="19306684">Now, as we understand the argument for the appellants and for the Government, they're not saying, impose in any sense of, here's a perpetuity, take it or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4837.397" offset="19349525">If they were, I don't see how they could have appealed from the decision of the Supreme Court of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="4842.247" offset="19368960">They're saying that the Supreme Court of California is wrong because under federal law, we are directing you to validate these contracts imposed in the sense that you regulated interstate commerce or draft men into the army or taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4857.357" offset="19429355">Now, we submit that what's here involved, you understand, is simply an exercise of the power to spend for the general welfare, a very important power.</text>
            <text syncTime="4866.837" offset="19467285">But that power must be distinguished from the power to regulate and coerce as we say in our briefs, under the specifically designated powers of the Constitution, which are not here involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4878.633" offset="19514514">Under those powers, sure the Government can go a very long way.</text>
            <text syncTime="4882.224" offset="19528829">Here it's the well forced problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="4884.018" offset="19536039">In our brief we point out that this Court, wherever it has been appropriate to do so, has carefully distinguished between what the Federal Government can do under the spending and welfare and property disposing power if there is such and under the much broader powers to regulate and coerce and so forth which are not involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4904.586" offset="19618273">Now, we quote from the Butler case, both from the Court's opinion and from the dissenting opinion, which are to light the in -- to light the effects here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4911.723" offset="19646798">Both say that you cannot use the spending power to coerce actions left to state control.</text>
            <text syncTime="4917.220" offset="19668846">Ashwander against Tennessee, the Hopkin Saving Association against Cleary which is a -- a case remarkably similar to the present case where Justice Cardozo, for a unanimous Court, held that under the spending power which the Government there relied upon, federal law could not permit to Wisconsin State Savings and Loan Associations to transmute themselves into Federal Savings and Loan Associations without the consent of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="4947.916" offset="19791621">And the Cardozo opinion states that this might be permitted under a regulatory power of the Government such as the power to regulate interstate commerce, he gives that example but it may not be permitted under the power exerted namely, the spending power.</text>
            <text syncTime="4962.366" offset="19849404">Now, we think it's probably so that this Court will not get to this constitutional question of what can be done under the Welfare Clause because Congress seems to have been so clear, in electing to proceed by way of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="4978.527" offset="19914083">If -- if the Court should get there, it's sufficient to say I think that the decision that the United States under the welfare authority can impose a contract against its will on a state irrigation district would go very far towards obliterating any difference between the power to regulate interstate commerce and the power to spend --</text>

            <text syncTime="5211.330" offset="20845296">In the first instance, it is our reading of the decision of the Supreme Court of the State of California that what it was talking about was a contract that had been executed by an irrigation district and that a careful reading of that decision will show that what the Court held was that an irrigation district did not have the power under California law to execute such a contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="5283.637" offset="21134524">It does not have equal protection in those words but in the Pasadena versus Stimson case, the Court found equal protection under the California Constitution in Article 1, Section 11 which provides generally that the laws must have general application.</text>
            <text syncTime="5301.937" offset="21207667">It is further our position that in view of the fact that one of these contracting agencies, the state irrigation district under state law does not have the power to execute this contract, that there is no federal question in that issue that is presented to this Court because we do not see and we do not agree with appellants that by the force of any federal law that a state agency can be invested with the power that is denied to it under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5336.350" offset="21345384">We do not see how this Court could read validity into a contract between a state agency and the United States or the state agency and any other person if under state law that agency is without power to execute the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="5355.174" offset="21420617">Now, in discussing the acreage limitation provisions of the contract, I think that we should review briefly the nature and extent of those provisions itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="5381.514" offset="21526047">It is our contention that the provisions of this contract containing the acreage limitation provisions with an irrigation district of the State of California which imposes those conditions upon a landowner against his will are invalid and unconstitutional provisions of the contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="5963.334" offset="23853244">Such is not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5965.460" offset="23861812">The contract provides that every excess landowner shall not sell any of his excess land except at a price that is approved by the Secretary of Interior and failing to do that, failing to get that approval that the land is then forever barred from receiving project water.</text>
            <text syncTime="5992.130" offset="23968496">Now, this provision of the contract, which is contained, expressly entered, and in the letter that we set out in our appendix to our brief has not been discussed either in oral argument or in the briefs by appellants here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6008.903" offset="24035579">Now what -- what gentlemen, does this mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="6011.788" offset="24047073">Take for example Phil Albonico, a man who through his efforts and his work starting out as a sheepherder, a Basque sheepherder as a boy and coming over to this country when he was 12 years old, getting the band of sheep eventually selling them and starting to farm and building his farm up to 1280 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="6032.077" offset="24128261">During the period that he was doing this, within the boundaries of the Madera Irrigation District, his entire lands, all of them were assessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6040.231" offset="24160862">And with the assessments that were gained from his and other lands, the Madera Irrigation District developed the earliest priority of waters on the San Joaquin River upon which the Government is relying and distributing these waters in the Central Valley Project and litigated those rights with Miller &amp; Lux for years and years.</text>
            <text syncTime="6061.091" offset="24244349">This man finally is faced with a contract that is entered into by the United States in the District.</text>
            <text syncTime="6067.917" offset="24271621">In 1951, after some, what -- 31 years of assessment that says, now your excess land not only cannot receive water but you can't sell any of your excess land except at a price that is fixed by the Secretary of Interior of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="6089.219" offset="24356780">And if you do so sell it, the land will be forever barred from receiving project water.</text>
            <text syncTime="6096.453" offset="24385724">Well, to say that this is not a limitation upon sale of land in an irrigation district, is not a recognition of the economic facts of life.</text>
            <text syncTime="6106.530" offset="24426057">No purchaser will purchase land in an irrigation district that is subject to assessment but is forever barred from receiving water, the sole supply of which comes from the Federal Government through the irrigation district in the Central Valley Project.</text>
            <text syncTime="6123.323" offset="24493244">And so we say that here is a property right of Mr. Albonico, is the right to sell his land at such price as he could receive, that is taken away from him, by this contract because now he has imposed upon that price the will and the -- and the determination of the Secretary of Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="6145.423" offset="24581642">Now, what form can he turn to?</text>
            <text syncTime="6148.215" offset="24592823">What administrative remedy does he have or what judicial remedy does he have if the Secretary of Interior fixes that price at a price that doesn't suit Mr. Albonico?</text>
            <text syncTime="6159.931" offset="24639634">He has none.</text>
            <text syncTime="6163.358" offset="24653427">The question of his supply of water under state law, he is entitled to distribution, readably by the district in accordance with the amount of his assessment to his proportionate share of the water of that irrigation district.</text>

            <text syncTime="6184.369" offset="24737437">As his assessment bears to the total assessment of the district, he is entitled to that portion of the district water.</text>
            <text syncTime="6192.331" offset="24769306">If his assessment were a dollar and the district were $100, he would be entitled one one-hundredths of the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="6198.891" offset="24795533">Now under state law, if he does not use that water within his district, he is entitled to assign it to someone else in the district so that they can use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6208.618" offset="24834403">But now under this contract, his excess lands -- his lands over 160 acres are suddenly deprived of this right to receive their proportionate share of the waters of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="6222.709" offset="24890828">Now, it has been said by appellants, well he might receive some indirect benefit for his excess land such as the underground water supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="6232.234" offset="24928862">That very issue was raised in the Albonico case and the trial court in that case found that there was absolutely no benefit that the land would receive as a factual matter unless it received its water supply for all of its lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="6248.480" offset="24993855">And said to the district, either enter into some kind of a contract where you can give this man his proportionate share of the water or exclude him from the boundaries of the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="6261.024" offset="25044010">Now again, I ask what form do we go to, to recompense Mr. Albonico or any landowner in a district, whether he now be excess or non-excess, he may be excess tomorrow if he's a husband and wife and his wife dies and he inherits the other half of the property, he immediately then becomes one of the suspect class.</text>
            <text syncTime="6285.344" offset="25141290">Where do we turn to recompense him?</text>
            <text syncTime="6287.887" offset="25151530">What form do we go to, to reimburse him for these property rights that have been taken?</text>
            <text syncTime="6294.592" offset="25178279">The appellants say, he can sue the United States and he can recover damage if he has sustained any and therefore, there is no constitutional deprivation of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="6308.602" offset="25234390">As was pointed out by Mr. Rockwell, in the first instance, this validation proceeding could well act as any bar to a further proceeding for compensation because the contract which imposed and which took his rights away, if validated, would settle for once and for all, whether he had any litigable rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="6333.093" offset="25332297">His day in court is on the validation of this contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="6339.149" offset="25356539">His day in court is to say this contract deprives me of rights and it is illegal for you to execute such a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="6349.108" offset="25396349">We don't contend or we don't admit that he is required to stand back and say, ”This contract takes these rights away from me but my only remedy is one, to sue the United States or the district or whoever for damages for my deprivation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6369.157" offset="25476598">As Mr. Rockwell pointed out, that would turn inverse condemnation into a universal duel that would completely wipe out the Due Process Clause of the State or any Federal Constitution because it would be a complete answer to say we held the -- in the case of the Federal Government, we have the constitutional power to take this right.</text>
            <text syncTime="6394.488" offset="25577848">Therefore, all you have to do is sue us for the damage without the United States going through the procedure of getting the congressional authority and to act -- to take this right by a condemnation procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="6409.378" offset="25637512">And so we feel, gentlemen, that this is the form that these people who are excess landowners or who may become excess landowners must turn to in order to have their rights protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="6423.666" offset="25694563">It is this very case, a determination as to whether or not this contract as to these landowners is valid or invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="6433.196" offset="25732702">It is this form that he must come to and at this time in order to receive his protection.</text>

            <text syncTime="6575.286" offset="26301127">As you recall in referring to the Albonico case, Mr. Davis said that what the Court there held was -- that Mr. Albonico was entitled to water.</text>
            <text syncTime="6587.894" offset="26351491">No such holding was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="6590.696" offset="26362776">There was no holding in that case that Mr. Albonico could enforce the Bureau of Reclamation to deliver water to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="6600.461" offset="26401750">If you will turn to page 183 of the appendices to the jurisdictional question, this is what the Court said there and I think it's important because it indicates how strongly the talk is that the Court is talking about the power of a district to act rather than the power of the United States to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6621.286" offset="26485133">It says that in view on our decisions in Ivanhoe and Madera wherein it was held that the excess land provisions in similar contracts were improperly included therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="6632.808" offset="26531213">It must be concluded in this proceeding that the district, not the United States, the district may not impose on landowners within the district, the limitations contained in Sections 28, 29 and 30 of the contracting question and that all of the petitioners' lands within the district, they're entitled to their fair rateable portion of water distributed and to be distributed by the district for irrigation purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="6662.790" offset="26651063">The Court then goes on to say that if the district can enter into a proper contract that he will be entitled to his rateable portion of water, and consequently, in view of the fact that the district does not impose these limitations on him, that he is not entitled to be excluded from the district because there is hope that in the future that the question will be solved.</text>
            <text syncTime="6687.292" offset="26749074">Now, in conclusion then, in restating our position, we feel that what the court below was dealing with was the rights of an irrigation district to contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="6699.848" offset="26799334">That it held that those rights were not such that the district by a contract with the United States or any other person could discriminate among the landowners of the district on the amount of land that they held.</text>
            <text syncTime="6715.117" offset="26860460">We hold that the court below determined that a contract which prohibited the vesting of a valid, permanent or pertinent right to water in the district for the benefit of the landowner, was contrary to state law and that the district could not so execute a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="6735.262" offset="26941022">Now, we are then presented with this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="6739.334" offset="26957322">You say to us there is a hiatus here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6742.099" offset="26968294">The Federal Government cannot act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6744.532" offset="26978116">May we point out to you that in 1956 by amending the acts of Congress that the United States has already provided that the contracts could be amended to include a permanent water right and could -- already has provided that the contracts could be amended to provide for credit for repayment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6766.606" offset="27066410">So, two of the three questions are now out of the way and the only thing that remains is the question of action by Congress or the State so that an irrigation district can execute such a contract as is now before this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="6858.647" offset="27434527">The trial court held that that planning of the Board was incorrect and there was a very serious question before the California court as to the correctness of the trial court's findings, the authority of the trial court to review this finding of the Board and the proper remedy that should be -- should be granted if the Board of Directors of the district was in fact incorrect.</text>

            <text syncTime="6914.257" offset="27656986">One, that do you contend that under federal law in its entirety and the powers given therein to the Secretary of the Interior, the Federal Government comes stupendously speaking may impose conditions such as are contained in this contract against the opposition and resistance of California, opposition and resistance derived from what it concedes to be the limitations of the contracting power of its irrigation districts?</text>

            <label>Mr. B. Abbott Goldberg</label>
            <text syncTime="6952.788" offset="27811109">You asked for a categorical answer, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="6956.119" offset="27824379">Now, I -- I will give it to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="6958.036" offset="27832111">One, we have not considered that question because in our opinion, if -- if plain language has any meaning, California law has given these districts all the power they need.</text>

            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="6969.828" offset="27879236">And that brings me to the second question.</text>
            <text syncTime="6971.742" offset="27886968">Since -- since you -- you don't have to say yes or no if it isn't involved (Inaudible) answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="6978.304" offset="27913195">Is it your contention that the chief claims so far as I'm concerned that the irrigation districts are not empowered, indeed are disabled by California law from entering into such a contract is not so, that California law does not disable the irrigation districts and California law authorizes the irrigation districts to enter into the contract in controversy?</text>

            <label>Mr. B. Abbott Goldberg</label>
            <text syncTime="7006.729" offset="28026880">Yes, our contention is that California law authorizes the districts to enter into these contracts and that the contracts are -- were held invalid by the California court, not for any lack of capacity on the part of the districts but because the United States could not get the sort of title that the California court thought it needed.</text>

            <label>Mr. B. Abbott Goldberg</label>
            <text syncTime="7042.088" offset="28168255">Well, Your -- Your Honor, he -- he makes a point about this business of the applicable federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="7049.892" offset="28199497">You have a state statute where it says, “You can contract with the United States under the applicable federal law” and he says that is a state question which federal law is applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="7059.958" offset="28239830">Well, I -- I can't bring myself to pass the hurdle.</text>
            <text syncTime="7064.220" offset="28256862">How you can say the decision of which is an applicable federal law is a state question, but suppose you do.</text>
            <text syncTime="7071.444" offset="28285701">Let's look at why the federal law, the acreage limitation, is not applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="7077.460" offset="28309838">You -- you can't just decide this question in a vacuum.</text>
            <text syncTime="7080.053" offset="28320183">You have to look why?</text>
            <text syncTime="7081.738" offset="28326870">It's not applicable, says the California court because under Section 8, the United States has disabled itself from acquiring this sort of title that it needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="7093.475" offset="28373891">Now, one -- one other thing, and I'll confine myself to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="7099.102" offset="28396356">Mr. Rockwell says, "Well, if Section 8 means what we claim it to be," that is, that the United States can give the sort of rights that it needs for the acreage limitation, "why all this monkey business," and I'm quoting,” and why all this monkey business about appropriations?” Now, I hate to take this Court down the rat hole of water -- of water along the west because it is extremely confusing, but you have to look at Section 8 in its historical context.</text>
            <text syncTime="7128.390" offset="28513489">And unfortunately, the legislative history on Section 8 is not particularly revealing.</text>
            <text syncTime="7134.598" offset="28538358">But you look at Section 8 and certain things do become clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="7140.075" offset="28560300">One, the section was drafted at a time when it was feared that the United States through the ownership of public lands could impose on the States, a system of water law which the States deemed hostile to their interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="7156.407" offset="28625607">As a matter of fact, I use by way of illustration the Winters case, we haven't cited in here.</text>
            <text syncTime="7161.895" offset="28647549">It's not -- it's not really germane to this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="7164.221" offset="28656849">But in the Winters case, the United States succeeded in obtaining a sort of riparian right for an Indian reservation in the State of Montana where only appropriative rights were recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="7175.890" offset="28703556">And if that situation could exist, then every appropriative right on a stream where the United States owned land might be in jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="7186.111" offset="28744411">So that's one reason for Section 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="7188.473" offset="28753816">Another reason for Section 8 is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="7191.265" offset="28764996">You will notice the statement in the Section 8, “beneficial use shall be the measure of the right.”</text>
            <text syncTime="7198.500" offset="28793940">At one time in western water law, strangely enough, beneficial use was not the measure of the right.</text>
            <text syncTime="7206.272" offset="28825078">There are old cases indicating that the size of your ditch, your -- your transportation was the measure of the right.</text>
            <text syncTime="7212.976" offset="28851827">The amount you could divert, not the amount you could use and the legislative history does say putting this language in the measure of the right does accord with what seems to be the common sense that you should -- that's an improvement they say on the state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="7228.113" offset="28912431">Finally, there is a third reason, and this perhaps is most the compelling but the most difficult to explain, Section 8 exists as a device to protect the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="7242.087" offset="28968333">You -- you read cases like Lux against Haggin.</text>
            <text syncTime="7246.907" offset="28987559">And Lux against Haggin states --</text>

            <text syncTime="7258.108" offset="29032385">Lux against Haggin states of the Acts of 1866, 1870, 1877, the Desert Land Acts whereby the United States recognized the appropriation rights says these Acts constituted grants to unnamed grantees.</text>
            <text syncTime="7274.702" offset="29098736">That's their language.</text>
            <text syncTime="7276.287" offset="29105110">Actually what those Acts did is give to everybody in the world or everybody capable of getting access to a stream, gave them the power to appropriate under state law so that if the United States itself in an appropriation state does not also make an appropriation, it leaves itself open.</text>
            <text syncTime="7297.429" offset="29189642">It leaves itself vulnerable to somebody else coming in and making an appropriation on top of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="7305.452" offset="29221721">Now, this situation can occur, it has occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="7309.444" offset="29237708">And if the United States were to appropriate, it would protect itself against that.</text>
            <text syncTime="7314.912" offset="29259546">But once the United States has secured the property right, has declared its use of the water to the exclusion of other uses, we do not think that state law can control the particular sort of use that the United States makes.</text>
            <text syncTime="7329.173" offset="29316598">Mr. Rockwell says, “Well, how -- how can the United States acquire a greater right than the state has to give?”</text>
            <text syncTime="7336.419" offset="29345646">And there, the answer, it seems to us, abundantly simple where it's no different in the water right than it is the case of buying the post office site or anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="7345.843" offset="29383367">The United States buys a piece of land for a federal purpose subject to a zoning restriction, the United States is not subject to the zoning restriction or other police regulations itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="7356.352" offset="29425371">In that sense, the United States does simply by virtue of its capacity as the sovereign government have greater rights than any other person can have.</text>
            <text syncTime="7365.768" offset="29462988">It can get a greater right than the State has to give.</text>
