            <text syncTime="9.941" offset="39706">Mr. Zirpoli.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. A. J. Zirpoli</label>
            <text syncTime="11.608" offset="46393">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.206" offset="68754">In the case of William Francis Rupp, certiorari was granted by this Court to review the denial of the Supreme Court of the State of California of a petition filed by Laura (Inaudible), the sister of the prisoner in condemned role in which she alleges and set forth -- sets forth that there is good reason to believe that a defendant now under death sentence is insane.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.968" offset="175856">And she proceeded in her petition to set forth factual allegations supporting this conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.050" offset="208144">The warden had denied -- had refused to call the question of the sanity of the condemned prisoner to the attention of the District Attorney in the manner required by Section 3701 of the Penal Code of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.203" offset="268748">Now, before reviewing the facts in the law pertinent to the instant case with the kind indulgence of this Honorable Court, I should like first to direct some preliminary observations to a question asked by Justice Felix Frankfurter, in order that thereby, we may clarify and focus as sharply as possible our attention on the specific issue before the Court at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.755" offset="358922">Justice Frankfurter, if I -- if I recall his question correctly, stated, "Does this record permit me to say I don't now have to decide constitutionality of this statute?"</text>
            <text syncTime="102.781" offset="411063">I respectfully submit at the outset that the petitioner does not now necessarily question the constitutionality of Section 3701 of the Penal Code of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.976" offset="467801">Hence, I would say in response to the question of Justice Frankfurter that it is not now necessary for this Court to pass upon the constitutionality of Section 3701 as a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.645" offset="514508">I say it does -- it is -- does not now necessarily have to question the authority or the propriety of having the warden make the determination of the sanity of the condemned prisoner.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.487" offset="561946">The petitioner in this case does not question why did the California Court did summarily deny a petition for writ of habeas corpus where the facts alleged merely show a suggested insanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.337" offset="609280">The words used in both the Noble's case and in the case of Solesbee versus Balkcom.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.602" offset="630387">However, the petitioner in this case does insist that the California courts have the power to entertain judicial process when the facts alleged show a clear abuse of authority on the part of the warden.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.545" offset="694126">This power closed from the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.135" offset="716487">The absolute refusal of the Court to exercise the power results in a denial of due process and because of these observations on the question propounded by Justice Felix Frankfurter, I respectfully submit that the question as suggested on page 1 of the brief by the respondent which reads, "Is the California procedure, which provides no judicial review of a warden's determination of a condemned prisoner sanity constitutional?"</text>
            <text syncTime="210.903" offset="843546">This question in my opinion is not the proper question for this case, and while I set forth two suggested questions in -- in my brief and in the petition of writ of certiorari, I must confess that on further consideration of this case, the questions should be even more pointed and become even more precise -- precise.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.766" offset="931004">And that the basic question here is, "Does the refusal of the California courts to grant a review of the Warden's ex parte determination of the sanity of a prisoner under sentence of execution, constitute a denial of due process when there is good reason to believe that the prisoner is insane."</text>

            <text syncTime="649.913" offset="2599602">The first difference is the difference with relation to the petitions themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.211" offset="2616842">In the Caritativo petition, there are two paragraphs which are in effect conclusions of law if they relate to the question of the sanity -- claimed sanity of the prisoner.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.781" offset="2659056">Whereas in the Rupp case, there are 14 paragraphs relating to the claimed insanity of the prisoner which show a history of mental and physical disorder of the condemned man from the day of his birth to and including his incarceration and condemned row.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.524" offset="2722064">And I do not propose to go into all of those facts except to quote if I might from this including paragraph of the -- of a medical doctor, William F. Gray, who served on the staff at San Quentin who had seen Rupp at the time of his admission to the prison and who had visited him over a period of two -- two years in his rounds of the prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.801" offset="2799177">And he said, "I found William Rupp to be a deeply withdrawn child-like personality who mentally might be best be termed a low-grade moron."</text>
            <text syncTime="710.598" offset="2842331">I do not believe that William Rupp has the mental capacity to understand the nature and quality of his crime or his punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.079" offset="2876291">The second difference is the fact that in the Caritativo case, there was an affidavit on file from the warden which was tantamount to a return to order to show cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.061" offset="2920176">In this case, there is no such affidavit on file.</text>

            <text syncTime="1153.414" offset="4613642">He says, the granting of reprieves for the reason that a condemned inmate has become insane is a matter of grace and not a requirement of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.806" offset="4655125">Now, while there may be some historical basis for the argument that there were is some relationship between executive clemency and the power to retrieve.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.493" offset="4689920">The fact remains that historically and throughout the civilized world and as best as I can determine in every state of the union, the execution of -- of an insane person is deemed contrary to all humanitarian and moral principles and violates the universal sense of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.942" offset="4759719">And in California, in recognition, you might say, this basic and -- and basic principle of universal justice, in the California recognition of it, we have two statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.969" offset="4807784">We have Section 1367 of the Penal Code which says a person cannot be tried sentence or punished for a public offense while he's insane and as a further -- and in further implementation thereof, we find 3701 directs to warden when there is good reason to believe that the person is insane to call it to the attention of the District Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.265" offset="4900989">Now, this statutory provision is not a matter of grace, but it's a codification in the sense of the basic precept of justice to which I have previously referred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.183" offset="4944666">If the conduct violates due process, it can't be a matter of grace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.880" offset="4963474">Section 371 would conform -- would conform the due process when the award max within the discretion granted to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.701" offset="4990746">But when he disobeys the law, he completely refuses to adhere to the direction, a mandatory direction to use the language used by this Court in the filed case when he refuses to adhere to such mandatory direction that he shall call the prisoner to the attention of the District Attorney, then such refusal on the part of the Court constitutes a denial of due process and that is of complete failure to protect the prisoner who's about to be executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.272" offset="5109029">The District Attorney goes on and says, "Due process at most requires that the power to grant a reprieve to a condemned inmate who has become insane if he reposed in some officer tribunal."</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.902" offset="5155527">He then says, "Due process does not require a jury trial or other adverse -- adversary hearing to the determination of the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.571" offset="5186247">Now, I would be prepared to concede both of those statements in their general sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.215" offset="5204846">I think that the power can repose in some officer or tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.977" offset="5219892">I do not think that it's necessary that there be a jury trial or adversary proceeding in that sense."</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.852" offset="5243402">And then he says, "The procedure used in California affords due process."</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.579" offset="5262315">Now, if the last call, the procedure used in California affords due process, if by that, he means the procedure proscribed by Section 3701, if followed, provides due process of law, then again, I would be in the Court ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.429" offset="5325636">But the point we make, the procedure proscribed by Section 3701 was not followed in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2593.384" offset="10373433">Now, under the Solesbee case, the legislature had not made such a prohibition but had simply left this power to be exercised by the Governor and to make it identical with Solesbee to have adopted the procedures which are actually utilized by the warden, that is to say reports from his medical and psychiatric stand to be furnished to the Governor, we would have Solesbee versus Balkcom right in point.</text>

            <text syncTime="3278.562" offset="13114201">The Attorney General had said in responsible to a question of Justice Brennan, at least if I interpret what he said correctly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.407" offset="13141577">He said that if there had been an assertion of a -- of a violation of the equal protections of the law's clause that the Court could entertain judicial -- judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.238" offset="13188911">Well, I just like to say briefly that I cannot see how he can consistently take that position, and at the same time take the position that there can be no judicial review if the question involved stood on another constitutional privilege and that is the privilege of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.826" offset="13251291">And there was one other comment that was made and that's the fact of the four-year delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.239" offset="13268950">Well, I'm not here by way of apology, but the factor of four-year delay would require a -- a detailed statement as to all of the history of this case and it must be remembered that I came to this case four years ago at the appointment of the District Court under circumstances in which the petitioner and the petition previously filed had alleged that there was a violation of due process in the trial court itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.023" offset="13360065">But there had not been an exhaustion of the state remedies as a consequence of which and because of appeals that the petitioner insisted in taking in which I would not participate, at least as far as certiorari to this Court is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.511" offset="13406041">The case ran through the gauntlet then to determine the fact that he had not exhausted his state remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.764" offset="13427043">Thereafter, I did file a petition to the Supreme Court of California for the purpose of determining that question and exhausting the state remedies if it became necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.336" offset="13461316">That petition was denied, certiorari was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.365" offset="13473437">And then having exhausted my state remedies pursuant to Section 2255 of Title 28, I went into the District Court and raised the question of the due process of law insofar as the trial itself is concerned and that case then went through the usual gauntlet and it was not until that point and until an effort to have the Governor commute the sentence of the prisoner to life imprisonment without possibility of parole that I came into Court and sought to establish the present sanity, the question of the present sanity of the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.661" offset="13594540">Because his sanity at the time he committed the offense and that the question of where there's a denial of due process in the trial itself was a paramount importance because it went to the very innocence or guilt of the accused if he were incapable to formulate the intended -- if that were a defense, the denial of which would have constituted due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.597" offset="13674371">Hence, that is the history of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.735" offset="13682939">It's an unfortunate gauntlet that one must go through in these circumstances but it's unavoidable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.435" offset="13701642">However, regardless of justifiable or lack of justifiable cause, the question is now before this Court.</text>
