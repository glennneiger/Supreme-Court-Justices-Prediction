            <text syncTime="13.994" offset="55902">Mr. Carman you may proceed?</text>

            <label>Mr. W. B. Carman</label>
            <text syncTime="15.661" offset="62589">Mr. Chief justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.580" offset="78263">This is a case of first impression which tests the right of the copyright in order to limit, control or prohibit some other author in the creation of a parody or burlesque and in that -- to that extend it test the legitimacy of the arts of parody and burlesque.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.542" offset="154122">Before I state the facts, I'd like to get a little terminology out of the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.936" offset="171677">There will be no distinction made there in my talk between the voice of parody or burlesque.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.302" offset="197172">The nature of the parody or burlesque, there may be some distinctions that I shan't make them.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.158" offset="216607">The nature of parody or burlesque, I may say it's pretty easier to recognize, one that it is to define one, but the art consists generally in picking on some original, and in this discussion the original will be limited to a particular work of a particular author and then by use of exaggeration, distortion, all of the comic arts, all of the arts of humor, turning that original, metamorphosing as it might be the original and it's something comic and unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.759" offset="347011">The peculiar and unique effect with parody is really created by its audience and to a certain extent, where the writer presents sufficient similarities to the original in his work, so that the both similarities call back to the audience, their remembrance of what they first saw, and then they contrast that, in their minds with the funny things which the new author has done with it and that produces that rare unique result of a parody.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.958" offset="455784">Its peculiar humor lies in the fact that the audience recognizes the object of a parody, and if doesn't recognize the object, then it fails.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.664" offset="494655">So obviously the parodist needs to use a good deal of the original copyrighted work, because he has to point up the similarities between that work and his work, as well he does the differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.678" offset="542616">Now I come to the facts of this case.</text>

            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="138.172" offset="552647">You may need to rely on the memory of the audience to the original?</text>

            <label>Mr. W. B. Carman</label>
            <text syncTime="141.173" offset="564663">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.158" offset="568529">He stimulates the memory of the audience of the original if I may say it, Justice Frankfurter.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.444" offset="601757">In 1944 Loew's Incorporated produced a very fine motion picture called ‘Gaslight' which was copyrighted.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.531" offset="634044">It was based on a play by Mr. Hamilton, but the play is not involved in this case, only the motion picture copyright and there is a synopsis of this melodrama in the appendix to our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.382" offset="685453">It was an expensive play, a very successful play; it played to about altogether around 15 million people.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.968" offset="711784">In 1946, it was withdrawn from domestic exhibition, but it continued to be used abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.811" offset="743236">Mr. Benny as we probably all know was a very successful comedian and actor in the motion pictures, satires, stage, screen, radio and television and he had accustomed in his radio programs, so that from time to time, the parody or burlesque of various motion pictures, and when he came into television in 1952, he put on a television parody or burlesque of this picture ‘Gaslight,' this Loew's motion picture ‘Gaslight', and it was about 15 minutes skit on his television program in which he -- it was stated to be a satire on Gaslight and he took a few of the incidents in the general storyline.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Harold Burton</label>
            <text syncTime="226.489" offset="905927">Did he make it with the parody or did he leave that to the audience?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="w_b_carman" startTime="230.630" stopTime="432.587">
            <label>Mr. W. B. Carman</label>
            <text syncTime="230.630" offset="922436">He said it was a satire on the production of ‘Gaslight,' the words that I think he used and there's a synopsis to that also in the appendix to our brief to the extent that anybody can synopsize a parody or burlesque.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.898" offset="995579">Loew's objected to that action on the ground that it wasn't infringement of copyright.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.362" offset="1013447">The Broadcasters claimed that it was fairly used and nothing was done about that particular program.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.421" offset="1033613">That happened to have been what we call a live broadcast; it was a broadcast direct from the stage over the air.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.545" offset="1058168">Now subsequently it became the custom to a photograph he had broadcast and put then on the film.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.105" offset="1084395">And when I met Mr. Benny in 1953, was preparing his next season's series of five programs, he decided to repeat or remake this broadcast, this parody of ‘Gaslight'.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.927" offset="1139670">Loew's found out that he was about to do that through the newspaper publicity and they got a temporary restraining order against the production of the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.579" offset="1186273">That temporary restraining order was amended by stipulation to permit the photographing of the program on film; the case was then tried on stipulated facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.750" offset="1226919">There was only one witness, a Dr. Baxter of the University of Southern California who talked about the literary rights; and the court held that there wasn't infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.290" offset="1269133">The court first stated in its opinion and this was just to judge Carter, that the owner of a copyright was entitled to be protected against the taking of our substantial portion of its protectable material when that the copying of a substantial part constitutes an infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.714" offset="1330782">That's the general rule; it took from what we call a plagiarism case.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.576" offset="1346247">It found then upon examination of the works, that there was a substantial taking by defendant from the plaintiff's copyrighted property, and it declared that under these circumstances if this were the ordinary plagiarism case, without the defense of burlesque as a fair us, it would clear under the authorities that there had been access, a substantial taking, and therefore, infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.759" offset="1439033">Now, we concede that if this were an ordinary plagiarism case with two similar works involved that the taking of amount which we use for the parody, could properly be held to be a substantial taking from the original work.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.950" offset="1507788">The court, trial court then went on and cited and discussed a number of the cases involving fair use, but it categorized its pretence, the proposition that burlesques as a fair use justifies a substantial taking and it concluded and I quote, “Parody or burlesque taking is to be treated no differently from any other appropriation, that as in all other cases of burlesques taking the issue becomes first, one of the fact that is, what was taken, and how substantial was the taking, and if it is determined that there was a substantial taking, infringement exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.264" offset="1653029">The court made then formal finding that the television program copied a substantial part -- was copied in substantial part from the moving picture and that such part was a substantial part of the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.233" offset="1704856">If the use wasn't fair, and are made fair by the reason of the fact that the use was for parody or burlesque.</text>

            <text syncTime="521.808" offset="2087184">The court in the Court of Appeal looked down the fair use doctrine as being generally limited to the when “compilation (Inaudible) things digest and the like and it then adapted Judge Carter's rule that you test a parody and burlesque just the same as you do any other taking, and that the issue is what is taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.158" offset="2164611">How substantially was the taking, and if it was substantial, then infringement exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.449" offset="2189793">Now therefore, the lower courts held as a matter of law, that a parody and burlesque was legitimate only, if the amount of the copyright of the original which was used in its creation, is not substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.108" offset="2248411">We thought that was an erroneous, considered as an erroneous ruling, we asked for certiorari and it was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.425" offset="2277669">Now at the outset, this case depends upon the rule over Your Honor, which we think is applicable here of fair use.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.355" offset="2313404">In an answer to the Chief Justice's question, I want to develop and it takes me a few minutes to develop the limitations of this rule, which is the fair used doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.329" offset="2349244">We start with this proposition that the copyright act itself is broad in its language.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.275" offset="2373068">For our purposes it provides that the copyright owner has the exclusive right to print copy or sell his copyrighted work, to translate it or make any other versions, to exhibit, perform, represent, produce or reproduce it any manner or by any methods whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.344" offset="2453316">But the Copyright Act stems of course, as all laws do from the Constitution and the Constitutional Provision in this case, if the Court please is a rather unusual one.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.981" offset="2499918">It's Article 1 Section 8, which says, the Congress shall have the power to promote the progress of science and useful Arts, by securing for limited times through authors and inventors, the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.561" offset="2582152">You will note that the Constitution specifically provides, in this case the purpose of the Copyright Law, which is to promote the progress of science and the useful arts.</text>

            <text syncTime="703.198" offset="2812761">Now the makers of the Constitution recognized that it was tremendously important to this country, to see that learning and knowledge be disseminated and that the arts and sciences grow and flourish.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.430" offset="2873678">And they felt that they there was no real encouragement offered to produce that result, because once he had utilized his power to make a first publication, he had no further rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.554" offset="2926132">So, again, in order to promote the science and the useful arts and for that purpose only, they decided it give the author certain rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.304" offset="2969182">And the primary right obviously that the author should have, or at least they felt he should have was the right to market his work after publication for a limited period time and being free from having somebody else market the same work, but may I point out that this reward which they gave to the author under the Constitution was purely secondary and this Court has so held, the primary purpose of the act was to promote Science and the useable arts and only the rewards of the author was secondary to that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.988" offset="3119856">This Court has stated that principle very recently, it goes back to Chief Justice Hughes' statement in Fox Film against Doyal in 286 Federal, but this Court has repeated this statement in the Paramount case, in 334 US and (Inaudible) against Stein, i.e., that the primary purposes the promotion of the arts and the author's reward is purely secondary.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.006" offset="3219958">Now then, we therefore must construe the Copyright Act in connection with its primary purpose to promote the progress of science and the useful art.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.024" offset="3271993">Therefore, while we're not going to permit, and we should not permit some other author to market the copyright owner's work, we should not prohibit him from impeding the progress of these arts from destroying the very purpose of the Constitution by prohibiting him from using that work, and consequently it is not the law and it never has been the law, that regardless of the language of the Act, that a copyright owner has a complete monopoly of everything that appears in his work.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.979" offset="3423817">I can state it no better than as the late (Inaudible) Chapuis stated it in an article in which he wrote for the 45 (Inaudible) Law Review as filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.640" offset="3466553">Nobody else should mark the author's book, but we refuse to say nobody else should use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.524" offset="3498005">Progress would be stippled if the author had a complete monopoly of everything in his book for 56 years or any longer period.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.671" offset="3530606">Some of its contents must be permitted in connection with the independent creation of the other authors.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.429" offset="3553698">The very policy which leaves the law to encourage his creativeness also justifies it in facilitating the creativeness of others.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.663" offset="3586612">Now may I give an example, if it please the Court, and this is purely an example, for that reason there, I will bring things in a copyrighted work that are not covered by exclusive rights of the authors.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.358" offset="3633424">The best what we call uncopyrighted material, thoughts, concepts, ideas, now these maybe entirely original, they maybe very valuable, they may appear no where else, except in the copyrighted work, but they are not protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.530" offset="3702073">The best there are being not protected as so called uncopyrightable property, the best of rule has been stated many times, but the best statement is that of Justice Learned Hand I think, in the Nichols case which is in 45 F.2d 119 and the reason why those ideas, no matter how important they are, how valuable, how unique are not protected, is well stated by the court in (Inaudible) because it says that otherwise you did try to protect them, science, poetry, narrative and dramatic fiction and other branches of literature would be hindered by copyright, instead of being promoted.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.426" offset="3865704">Now I don't claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.675" offset="3870616">I want to make this clear; we don't claim that what we took here was uncopyrighted property.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.047" offset="3888170">We agree that what we took here was copyrighted property and in the amount, which the court might properly have found used I should say, instead it took, we used copyrighted property and in an amount which the court might find to be substantial, but I give this as an example Your Honors to show that the copyright monopoly is not all embracing and doesn't cover everything and never has.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.768" offset="3971030">And by the same reason, and for the same reasons, the doctrine of fair use to get to Mr. Chief Justice's question, the doctrine of fair use has been established in the law for the purpose of permitting certain uses of copyrightable property, because otherwise, for the same reason, the progress of arts and science in the primary purpose of the copyright law would be destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.537" offset="4074057">Now the fair use doctrine is not as the Court of Appeal seem to think sort of a convenient catchall phrase for a lot of miscellaneous exceptions to the law, and it certainly is not as respondents argue, just another name for the rule which says that a substantial taking maybe infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.069" offset="4152216">In other words, as I understand respondent's argument, it is that any taking which is substantial is an infringement and the fair use rule that simply means that an insubstantial taking is not an infringement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1126.675" offset="4506645">He says, fair use was evolved as a concept by the course in the English speaking world where they view to aiding the development of science and arts by allowing the use of copyrighted materials, despite the monopoly of copyright.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.202" offset="4576758">Now let us see in what area this fair use rule populates, from directly to the Chief Justice's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.147" offset="4612493">We have on the one hand this rule of substantiality which is the rule the lower court applies stated conversely, no taking is an infringement unless it constitutes a substantial part.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.228" offset="4664842">There must be a substantial taking to be an infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.067" offset="4676232">Now the lower court said there was a substantial taking, hence an infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.870" offset="4695458">The rule is there must be a substantial taking to be an infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.045" offset="4716147">Now that's in the nature of our rule de minimus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.069" offset="4728268">It's been so stated by some other courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.364" offset="4737358">The way you test that rule, the way you find out whether there has been a substantial taking, you take a look at the two works.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.015" offset="4764003">You'll find a similarity that exists between the two works.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.666" offset="4778632">And then you'll see whether looking only at the copyrighted work, the material in the copyrighted work that appears in the new work is substantial, is more than not de minimus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.815" offset="4831190">Now that's a restrictive and rigorous rule that you can imagine because it's usually applied in cases where there has been a literary effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.115" offset="4860447">Somebody has just walked in and taken it and used it for their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.506" offset="4878002">Now we in our brief set forth how (Inaudible) it is, but I'd like to point out that a single sequence from a movie has been held substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.362" offset="4913424">An incident or a part of an incident in a play has been held a substantial taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.575" offset="4934217">The using of three sentences from one book was held a substantial taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.362" offset="4953443">The using of the lyrics of the chorus of a popular song is a substantial taking.</text>

            <text syncTime="1248.905" offset="4995553">But there's an area, Your Honors, between that rule which says there must be a substantial taking to be an infringement and the other end of the scale with which we concur that says that you must take so much of a man's work that you're trying to market his work as your own.</text>

            <text syncTime="1482.517" offset="5930005">No one can doubt that a reviewer may fairly cite largely from the original work, if his design be really and truly to use the passages for the purposes of fair and reasonable criticism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.757" offset="5982981">On the other hand, it is as clear that if he cites the more important parts of the work with the view not to criticize but to supersede the use of the original work and substitute the review for it such a use such will be deemed to be piracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.739" offset="6050900">And Justice Clifford sitting in the case, in circuit in the case of Lawrence v.

            <text syncTime="1528.217" offset="6112862">And again, to answer to your question to Mr. Justice Frankfurter about the wrongness of the review, may I quote from the case of Hill against Whalen where it says this, “The reduction in demand, speaking of a literary criticism case, to be a ground of complaint, must result from the partial satisfaction of that demand by the alleged infringing production and a criticism of the original work, which lessened its money value by showing that it was not worth seeing or hearing, could not give any right of action for infringement of copyright.</text>

            <text syncTime="1687.738" offset="6750877">There are other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.139" offset="6756519">There are no cases as closely in point as a criticism and parody case, and for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.257" offset="6772924">The reason literary criticism is so given such broad use is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.307" offset="6789224">In the first place it's a very valuable art, the art of criticism and then the second place, the normal critics got to use the work if he is going to do a job, he can't write a book, if he doesn't tell what the book is about and usually he's going to quote them, so that in order to promote science and the useful art we're going to give that critic the broad extent of this rule of Fair Use within the area if it please the Court of Fair Use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.731" offset="6890893">I think it's a question of weighing on the one hand, the claim of monopoly of the offer, the claim to be exclusive just to be exclusive, and on the other hand, the public interest and the public need in making the particular use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.213" offset="6960797">Now Mr. Justice Frankfurter referred for example to many of it through the dictionary cases and to the other cases of Fair Use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.669" offset="6986606">We've the Fair Use doctrine for example in treatises where one historian will write a book and he'll go and get a lot of information and maybe quote quite a bit from other historian.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.158" offset="7024536">All we've like in cases of text books and we have written cases of synopsis and we have, we have a number of incidental uses, all of which are set forth in my book – in our brief and Your Honors we'll find an article that collects most of the cases in six as kept copyright symposium at Page 43.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.816" offset="7111262">Now you don't permit so much of a use in the case of the historian who goes to book and gets some information on it, but as you do in the literary criticism cases, and the reason is that the historian doesn't have to go there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.603" offset="7162358">He can go back and do all of his own original research if he wants to, but literary critic can't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.567" offset="7182211">Like the parodist the literary critic has to operate on something that's already there, but the historian can, so you're going to, in these cases, you're going to measure, you're going to weigh and the amount that's taken is going to be, is going to be one important part.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.854" offset="7243337">It's not going to be the major part, it's not going to be the substantiality rule, like mechanical rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.597" offset="7270296">You're not only going to say how much did he take, you're going to say, why did he take, what did he do with what he got, what product did he produce, and is it necessary or desirable for the progress of science and the arts, can he be permitted to take or on the contrary, will the science and the arts, will the useful arts in the dissemination of knowledge be held if you don't let him take it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.257" offset="7376980">Now it's clear the substantiality rule is not proper test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.473" offset="7389832">I've already given the literary criticism cases and I think it's perfectly clear that nobody else with literary criticism statements could use the, tell about the whole story of the play or a book, or quote copiously from it if he wasn't going to do it for literary criticism because if he did he would be infringing those exclusive rights which the Copyright Act says, but the critic can do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.130" offset="7484500">Because it's a public interest that he do, do it and therefore we won't let the office say, well, I'm the exclusive owner, so I won't let you use any of my work, even though it doesn't hurt me financially.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.182" offset="7532669">It doesn't, it doesn't interfere with my right to market my own work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.145" offset="7548552">I'll give one more example of the fact that the Substantiality Rule is not the basic rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.006" offset="7571958">It's been a held in two other case, one is cited in Mr. Selvin and one in ours, the Robbins case in our reply and the john's case and Mr. Selvin's brief, that the taking of a single course from a copyrighted song is a substantial taking, but on four occasions it's been held that the use of a single course from the copyright song is a fair use and it's depended on how it was used in one case, in an article, about the Green Bay Packers, they use the Green Bay Packers song, held it a fair use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.440" offset="7721691">In another case, in an article about the (Inaudible) if the pro white they use the old Perils of Pauline song that we remember many years ago, held the fair use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.466" offset="7757845">In another case in the story, where (Inaudible) he quoted a popular song as an incident, held to be fair use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.267" offset="7788983">In another case, a singer is saying the chorus of a popular song, held a Fair Use because in those situations there wasn't any destruction of this marketability right, and it was in the public interest of (Inaudible) and therefore the court said, there is no infringement in those situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.716" offset="7870798">Now it's our position Your Honor that parody and burlesque are entitled to the same rights, be measured by this same kind of measurement as literary criticism, and for the same reasons, not because they are criticism, they are, a parody can be a very vital criticism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.818" offset="7947180">I don't think there was ever any better criticism than Fielding's Shamela when he hit at Richardson's Pamela, but it's not because it and most parodies are critics because most parodies that make people think of themselves well, really was that original (Inaudible) as I thought it was when I heard it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.292" offset="8021159">The parody kind of gives you a little doubt in your mind, but that isn't the reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.018" offset="8044042">The reason why parodies and burlesques are entitled to the same fair use as is literary criticism, is for the same reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.253" offset="8072986">First, it's an important art.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.870" offset="8091376">It's one that we ought to protect and foster, and second, it's got to use the substantial part of the original in order to live and to grow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.727" offset="8130873">I don't have to do much arguing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.030" offset="8136098">I don't think about saying that parody and burlesque is an important art.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.844" offset="8155324">It's as old – older than the Greek.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.420" offset="8161593">Somebody and I don't know who it was, once said, that the first parodist was the witty neighbor of the first (Inaudible) and it goes back as (Inaudible) in the Greeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.244" offset="8196911">Most of our great writers, many of our great writers have written parodies, Fatery, (Inaudible) Fielding I've already mentioned, Kipling has written them.</text>

            <text syncTime="2096.996" offset="8387918">Now secondly Your Honor, it's got to use a substantial part of the work and the plagiarism sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.503" offset="8413936">I know that Mr. Selvin will disagree with me on this subject, but I think that from the very nature of this kind of an art it must use a substantial part of the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.763" offset="8455001">After all it's got to use the original, you can't have a parody without an original, and if it's going to strike at the story just as Gaslight struck at the story in this situation, it's going to have to use a part of that story or it doesn't have any effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.388" offset="8513515">I think if Your Honors will read and look at the parodies in the appendixes which we have summarized parodies in the appendix to our brief, you would realize that every one of them took what that de minimis or substantiality rule would call substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.783" offset="8571089">They have to, to get any effect to them and get a new (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.974" offset="8583837">Mr. Selvin suggests where you can use un-copyrighted property?</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.576" offset="8598256">You can use ideas or concepts and you can do it that way?</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.806" offset="8615184">Oh, you can sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.806" offset="8623125">There have been parodies of style yes, many of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.575" offset="8638276">There have been parodies that don't strike at particular book, many of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.891" offset="8651546">You can do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.299" offset="8657189">I suppose you can paint a great work of art and you don't have to use color, but when you come down and having a thing that's going to live, after all these things are un-copyrighted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.341" offset="8693342">They are not protectable because of their generalities, and the parody is got to be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.909" offset="8715598">Now I have got parody never substitutes for the original.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.361" offset="8729391">It never detracts from the people's enjoyment of that original.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.162" offset="8748617">If it does, if it substitutes, if you can go and see the parody and say, well I don't care I have seen all of my need to see the original show then it's an infringement Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.292" offset="8793130">It comes into that, but that isn't what a parody does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.393" offset="8801489">The parodist doesn't sell the original.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.251" offset="8808908">He tells the people -- he doesn't say look I am showing you the original.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.896" offset="8827507">He says, this original belongs to the man who wrote it, now look what I do with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.717" offset="8846838">You remember, you remember how this person did this line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.627" offset="8858436">For example, let's take Lewis Carroll's famous parody, ‘You are old, Father William the young man said, that's a direct parody.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.216" offset="8884767">That line is directly taken from a very moral poem by Southey, and I am sure that when the Lewis Carroll's poem came out everybody saw it, well look at how moral and look at how pious Southey was and look what Lewis Carroll does with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.150" offset="8952581">And he wasn't trying to sell Southey's work and we in Gaslight -- in our parody we weren't trying to sell Gaslight, we weren't trying to show to the people what they did in Gaslight.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.962" offset="8999811">We were trying to show to the people, to say to them, this you remember what they did in Gaslight, look how we fixed it up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.553" offset="9026142">Look how we made it funny, look how we changed it and create that aspect in the minds of the operators.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.927" offset="9051638">So, I think that the parody and burlesque fulfill all of the requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.759" offset="9074939">For the right of Fair use just as literary criticism does, not because it is criticism, but because it's an art that we want to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.513" offset="9105972">We want to have more parodies like those I put in our appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.861" offset="9123422">We want to keep, we don't want to lose it, we don't want to say that come 1958 those parodies die in America.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.247" offset="9156963">And it's an art that we want to protect and those parodies had to use what would have been a substantial part under the plagiarism rule of the other work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.515" offset="9198028">Now I would like to cover briefly two or three criticisms of this rule that respondents have put up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.370" offset="9225404">They say in the first place, well your parody was commercial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.194" offset="9244735">You put it on television and after all the American Tobacco Company sponsored it, so you had a commercial use.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.583" offset="9270230">Your Honor, it wasn't commercial, the parody wasn't commercial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.669" offset="9286635">It's certainly isn't commercial because somebody paid the author, and I don't think it's commercial because it happened to be the American Tobacco Company to pay the author.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.534" offset="9322057">The parody wasn't an advertisement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.006" offset="9331984">That's simply a new method which we have developed over the years in this country for, of economy, of the economics of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.450" offset="9365734">Television and radio operates and they produce their works of art if you want to call them that, and they are paid for by advertising sponsor, but that doesn't make what they produced is commercial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.959" offset="9411814">There is nothing commercial about that, perhaps I won't say that auto light was the work of art, that's the name of our parody.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.527" offset="9442011">I won't say that it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.338" offset="9449326">It gave me a lot of fun and I think it was a much work of art as a lot of movies I have seen and lot of books I have read, but I wouldn't say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.199" offset="9476702">But if it wasn't, may be tomorrow one will be and the mere fact that it was put on television and sponsored by a sponsor doesn't make parody advertising or the parody commercial, any more than it would be, if the Bob Merrill company should decide to give away a bunch of books for the purpose of advertising, not anymore Your Honor, then is the case where the artist or (Inaudible) where right next in the middle of your story you see the advertisement for the Buick automobile and probably the writer of that story got most of his money in the record from the General Motors who bought the advertisement, but that doesn't make the story commercial.</text>

            <text syncTime="2435.361" offset="9741375">We shouldn't write to make our own parody.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.545" offset="9750152">Well, Your Honor I don't think the Copyright Law intended to give him a right to make his own parody anymore than it intended to give him a right to control criticism.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.177" offset="9780663">He might just as well have said, well you can't choose anything in this article criticizing my work, unless you get my permission and you got to say good things about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.101" offset="9820369">So I don't think -- now another point that they try to make it is there is competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.979" offset="9839909">Well, there isn't any competition between our work and his work as being the same work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.919" offset="9871673">Surely, there is competition but every parody competes for the eyes and the ears of whoever is going to see it, it only goes to the people who can read or see or hear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.657" offset="9914619">Take Ms. Skinner's wonderful parody and I hope Your Honors have all read it, called, 'For Whom the Gong Sounds' and it's a wonderful parody of Mr. Hemingway's, 'For Whom the Bell Tolls'.</text>

            <text syncTime="2517.291" offset="10069159">In the turn of the century here (Inaudible) Field used to put on -- that's before my time, but (Inaudible) Field used to put on a burlesque in one theater right next door the original would be playing, and I could walk down and had I been there and have taken my choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.275" offset="10129032">Now I didn't -- wouldn't have gone to see (Inaudible) Field because I thought I was going to see the show that was being on next door, it would have been a kind of thing I wanted to see with (Inaudible) Field is dead.</text>

            <text syncTime="2545.015" offset="10180023">Then the final thing is as I have already mentioned and Mr. Selvin says, well maybe you have got a dim view or a picture from looking at this parody.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.949" offset="10219729">Well that's something he is got to expect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.650" offset="10230596">I mean the writer of a book has got to expect that somebody is going to take a dim view of his book and I don't think he can complain about that kind of a situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.554" offset="10266122">I think that's one he must face by himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.931" offset="10279706">So basically it seems to me parody has these rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.926" offset="10299664">Now Your Honor, we do not want to get very much help out to the authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.912" offset="10315546">We have got them all set forth in our brief and we have got them set forth and Mr. Selvin going to set forth in his brief, but you won't get much help out of the authorities, this is a case of first impression, neither the case authorities nor the text books.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.329" offset="10365283">I agree with Mr. Selvin, most of the American text say you can parody and burlesque, it's fair use, but they don't say why and they don't say much about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.861" offset="10391406">There are two notable exceptions which I would like to call the Court's attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.142" offset="10408542">First, a very fine article by a Judge Yankwich in 33 Canadian Bar Review on this case and on this problem, which is entitled Parody and burlesque in the law of copyright and secondly a very extensive note in 56 Columbia Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.137" offset="10476460">And I would to take a moment to talk about the second parody case, there has only been two really in the country and that came up subsequent to this case it is what I call the attorney case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.373" offset="10521391">It was a case of Columbia Broadcast, Columbia Company, Columbia Pictures Company against National Broadcasting Company in 137 Federal Supp.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.460" offset="10557753">348 and that was a case in which after the Benny parody, since these are put on one of the picture from Here to Eternity called Here to Obscurity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.507" offset="10606028">In those days Your Honor we had a few parodies on television.</text>

            <text syncTime="2730.914" offset="10923572">At the same time in that year since we've learned a little bit more about how to present a case and maybe judge Carter thought a little bit more about it, he also came to the conclusion as he says in his opinion that you ought to be able to take more if you were using a burlesque or a parody than you were on a serious proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.867" offset="10999432">You remember his first rule was treat it the same as any other appropriation, but in this case he decided to really opt it, but he had a dilemma.</text>

            <text syncTime="2781.630" offset="11126491">Now, on the ultimate issue of fact in this case Your Honor is to whether applying the rule for which I have argued, the rule of fair use which is that in this area, this area between no infringement on the one side, and all was infringement when you substitute on the other, you ought to consider the rights of the public, the primary purpose of the act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3069.099" offset="12276297">It being conceded as indeed it has been conceded since the inception of this case that what was taken by the petitioner's parody a part was the kind of a taking which all of the decisions hold to being infringement of copyright.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.907" offset="12351530">The difference between Mr. Carman and myself becomes somewhat a narrow one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.743" offset="12386952">His argument as I understand it is that parody because of its peculiar needs must be subjected to a somewhat different rule in the respect, in respect of what it may take from a copyrighted work than any other work, and that the doctrine of fair use so called is not as I hope to be able to demonstrate before I am through it is, merely a convenient expression for the proposition that one does not infringe a copyrighted work if he takes less than a substantial part of its copyrightable elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.110" offset="12580362">Now, since the right which was held infringed here is a statutory right and cannot exist apart from statute, perhaps as good a place as any to start is with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.270" offset="12649012">But, before starting with the statute, I'd like to go back to the Constitutional power pursuant to which the statute was enacted, and even beyond that to the legal context in which the Constitution was enacted and with which legal context, the framers, certainly those who were primarily responsible for the copyright power were familiar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.117" offset="12760398">It had been determined in England sometime before the Constitution was adopted, and I think the best expression of it, certainly the first expression of it was in the judgment of Justice Willes in Millar against Taylor which was decided I believe in 1769, that the teaching of a copyright work was free for all to use, But, when an author published a book even though copyrighted under the then existing English statute which was the first copyright statute so far as we know under the Anglo-American jurisdiction, he presented to the public his ideas, his intellectual conceptions, his theme, the teaching of the work, and that all were free to use that for any purpose which they desired.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.288" offset="12997068">But and he justified that or pretty much the reason that Mr. Carman has stated that it was necessary and desirable to promote the progress of the arts and sciences by disseminating information and learning the researchers and discoveries of the learner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.520" offset="13078047">But, he went on to say in effect the manner of expression, the arrangement of the words, the sequence of the words, the individual touch that the author gives, the concrete form into which he puts the abstractions, the intellectual abstractions are the things which copyright protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.384" offset="13169476">Now, Madison and Pinckney who proposed the copyright power in the Constitutional convention were undoubtedly familiar with Millar against Taylor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.110" offset="13220362">It was not only the leading case at that time, but it was about the only decision in England at that time as well as Donaldson against Beckett which came up in The House of Lords after Millar against Taylor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.003" offset="13275951">When they drafted the Constitutional power reciting its purpose to promote the progress of the sciences and useful arts; I think it is fair to say that they had in mind this very proposition that had already been laid down in the English cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.477" offset="13353900">Now, if they were thinking of promotion by disseminating the teaching of the work, but not by making the work public property and so far as its concrete form or expression is concerned, and I think that's shown by another part of the same Constitutional provision which is just as important as the statement of its purpose and that is the method by which that purpose was to be achieved, and the method was by securing to authors the exclusive right to their writings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.150" offset="13496529">Now, the Congress conformably to that power has enacted from time to time copyright statutes, resulting in 1909 in a general revision which is our present statute with very few changes since then.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.620" offset="13558387">The right which it confers as it must be under the Constitution is an exclusive right, and that right in relation to our problem is this, to copy an event, to perform, represent, or exhibit, to make or cause to be made a transcription or recording by which in any manner or by any method, the work maybe performed, represented, or exhibited, and to perform, represent, and exhibit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.847" offset="13719301">So far as statutory language is concerned, the act makes no distinction among the classes of works or the classes of persons who are subject to the exclusive right thus granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.160" offset="13784607">It carves out no exception for parodies or for parodists.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.008" offset="13803938">It carves out no exception for any kind of work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.219" offset="13820865">There is significance in the use in the statute of the phrase in any manner or by any method.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.409" offset="13857541">The drafters there were not indulging in the favor of lawyer's habit of cumulating synonyms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.834" offset="13883246">They were referring to two different ideas, in any manner, meaning in any mode or in any medium, by any method meaning by any mechanical means which maybe available to transcribe or record or reproduce the work if it is a work susceptible of that kind of expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.200" offset="13964748">Now the 1909 Revision was not just another day's work in the Congress of that era.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.084" offset="13996304">That provision was the product of over 100 years experience with copyright statutes beginning in 1790 as far as the Federal Statute is concerned and constantly amended over the time and amended I think with some significance, always in the direction of broadening the coverage of copyright, so that eventually as we have it now, virtually all the forms of creative expression are now subject to the Copyright Act, maybe copyrighted, and therefore obtain the exclusive right to which the statute refers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.197" offset="14152725">It was the product of more than that 100 years experience and that broadening trend that has continued ever since the first statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.062" offset="14184176">It was the product of a very determined movement among representatives of all of the creative branches of the arts in this country, who felt that the copyright statutes were patchwork as of the turn of the century, but they didn't adequately meet modern demands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.095" offset="14248333">A movement which was headed up considerable part by men such as Victor Herbert, John Philip Sousa, Mark Twain and certainly the latter was no stranger to parody or burlesque.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.544" offset="14302145">The Congress itself or a committee of The Congress, committee on patents, held extensive and intensive and elaborate theories on the revision of the Copyright Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.419" offset="14349584">As the report says, all of us who desired to be heard were heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.741" offset="14378945">We cannot assume in view that history and a few of the ancient lineage of parody to which Mr. Carman refers, we cannot assume that the Congress was unaware of the act or indifferent to the needs of it, and when it failed to make any exception in favor of parody or parodists of the 1909 revision broadly granting an exclusive right as it did, its failure was significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.347" offset="14497332">Had the Congress wanted the exception for which Mr. Carman speaks, it no doubt would have said so in 1909 or in the 50 years since.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.721" offset="14550831">Now, we come to the argument of necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.638" offset="14570475">In all through this case the petitioner's reliance has been on the argument of necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.768" offset="14607047">You can't have parody they say and they have said it from the start, you can't have parody without taking something from the work that you are parodying.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.411" offset="14653544">Well, I would like to suggest in the first instance with respect to that argument, it sounds to me like a question of policy for the Congress to determine, not a question of fact or a question of law for the court to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="3679.642" offset="14718537">And for the reasons which I have indicated, we can't assume that the Congress went ahead blindly for forgetting parody when it enacted the present law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3692.101" offset="14768379">But if it is a question with which we should be concerned in this case, I make two further suggestions, that both as a matter of common knowledge and as a matter of the evidence in this case, the argument for necessity is destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.495" offset="14853956">No doubt there are and have been in the thousand years or more of which we know of parody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3720.529" offset="14882064">There have been so called direct parodies, where some single specific work is burlesque.</text>
            <text syncTime="3728.229" offset="14912888">But, by and large, so far as my survey of the field has made it possible for me to form an opinion, by and large the great mass of parody or burlesque is parody of ideas, of schools of thought, of attitudes, of political and social causes, and even in the literally and dramatic field, not of specific works, but of schools of work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3757.210" offset="15028767">You take -- following up mentioned in the oral argument an example which is emphasized in petitioner's brief Northanger Abbey by Jane Austen, yes, Northanger Abbey started out as a lampoon, had something called The Mysteries of Udolpho, but, what it wound up as was not a parody of The Mysteries of Udolpho but of a class of novels of which the Mysteries of Udolpho was typical, and it lampooned not the specific work Udolpho but the whole class of so called horror novels and their own realistic approach to the problems of life.</text>
            <text syncTime="3797.657" offset="15190622">And that's typical of most burlesque or parody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3802.098" offset="15208385">But, even in the direct parody, when that which all everybody agrees is free even in a copyright work; it's plot, it's theme, it's intellectual conceptions, it's ideas, it's teaching, when that is free to anyone, even the direct parodist has all the material that he needs with which to furnish the identification with the original that is the basis of the claim of necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3833.558" offset="15334191">From here the eternity is a good example regardless of what Mr. Carson's opinion may be -- Carton's opinion maybe as to Judge Carter's -- the reason for Judge Carter's decision in that case, his decision in that case and in this case are perfectly consistent with each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3851.099" offset="15404304">He looked at the words in each, he said, in our case, there has been a substantial taking, a substantiality is measured in the law of Copyright, but in the eternity case there hasn't been, why? Because Sid Scissors stuck to the general coop, the general theme from Here to Eternity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3868.684" offset="15474730">Anybody who saw the parody and who had read either the novel or seen the Motion Picture would know immediately what was being parody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3876.795" offset="15507122">But, he had only taken that, which is free to everyone, and he made a very good parody, just as funny as the one that's involved in this case, if it's fun that we are after.</text>
            <text syncTime="3886.520" offset="15545992">Now Dr. Baxter who testified as an expert witness for the petitioner is not really when you read his testimony at large, is not really in disagreement with that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3900.196" offset="15600744">Dr. Baxter is a very charming and learned man.</text>
            <text syncTime="3905.884" offset="15623523">I do not appreciate either his honesty or his fairness or his learning when I say that as an expert witness, he was an advocate just as the lawyers were and quite properly so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3921.239" offset="15684859">Nevertheless, there is much in his testimony, supporting that idea if we are going to decide this question in a lawsuit rather than in the sort of an investigation, it could be made by a legislature, there was much support to the idea, that true parody, true burlesque does not parallel the original, never does, but actually, it is as he said I think at page 150 of the record, simply an excuse for having fun with an idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="3956.160" offset="15824562">Well, ideas as one district judge in New York said, ideas are free as air as even the Stationers' Company in England would admit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3967.125" offset="15868447">So, we say that the argument of necessity has no support actually either in the record of this case or in common knowledge as to the nature of the art.</text>
            <text syncTime="3979.743" offset="15918916">Well -- and what about fair use?</text>
            <text syncTime="3983.114" offset="15932395">Fair use with all difference to the many judges who have used the expression is a tag, it's a label.</text>
            <text syncTime="3991.372" offset="15965414">And whenever a legal concept or a legal doctrine is given a tag of that sort, there is always the danger that if we concentrate on the label, we won't see what's inside the package, and that's what's happened with the so called doctrine of fair use as it is sought to be applied in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4011.759" offset="16047020">Fair use does not have the term, fair use does not have a mysterious origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="4017.213" offset="16068754">So far as I have been able to discover, its first use or of an equivalent expression, was in England in 1810 in a judgment of Lord Evelyn, Brookins against Stacey, the cases to which I refer are all cited in the brief, so I don't stop to give volume or page number.</text>
            <text syncTime="4040.447" offset="16161750">Lord Evelyn was significantly enough discussing in that part of his opinion the question of how far a critic or reviewer could go.</text>
            <text syncTime="4052.005" offset="16207935">And he said that the critic or reviewer has no right to copy or reproduce the whole or a substantial or material part of the copyrighted work, although he may indulge in fair quotation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4070.372" offset="16281391">Now, it's quite obvious when you see it in the acquisition of those two terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="4075.428" offset="16301662">The whole or a material part of the work on the one hand, fair quotation on the other, that Lord Evelyn was not thinking of where quotation in the sense of anything that would be more than substantial itself or substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4093.225" offset="16372820">Well, that usage of translated into the term fair use apparently caught on with British judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="4100.117" offset="16400405">What we find in the House of Lords in Chatterton against Cave which came about 1878, we find Lord Hatherly saying, again discussing the question of how far a critic could go in a review.</text>
            <text syncTime="4115.296" offset="16461113">If the part taken is neither material nor substantial, if in other words as some judges put it Lord Hatherly said only a fair use is made, there is no infringement and that usage is continued in England down to the present day, even though the Act of 1911, the Copyright Act of 1911 made a very substantial change in the English law in certain situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4142.447" offset="16569783">The American usage has conformed to the English usage.</text>
            <text syncTime="4146.566" offset="16586188">It has been here as in England, simply a convenient label for the legal concept that infringement requires substantial taking of the copyrightable elements of the work, not a taking of the taking of the uncopyrightable elements or something less than substantial of the copyrighted elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="4168.261" offset="16673019">In America, I think the usage starts with the case to which Mr. Carman referred, with Mr. Justice Story's opinion when on circuit in Folsom against Marsh.</text>
            <text syncTime="4177.692" offset="16710740">Folsom against Marsh is an interesting case aside from the fact that it involved copyrighting the private letters of President Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="4186.354" offset="16745326">It contains as an attempt on Mr. Justice Story's part to give some specificity, some specific content to the substantiality rule, probably the most widely cited and quoted passage in Copyright Law when he said that what the courts will look at are the nature, the quantity, and the value of the extracts made, the purpose and objects of the selection or the selections made, the effect upon the copyrighted work, those three elements, the same three elements and I might add which Chief Judge Yankwich adapted in the article to which Mr. Carman referred and which incidentally was a critical comment by Judge Yankwich upon Judge Carter's decision in this case while this case was pending in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="4247.659" offset="16990563">Now Justice Story's comment obviously had in mind the English usage and I think that is established by an interesting fact among the very many times from which the passage has been quoted are at least two occasions when it was it quoted with approval by two different vice-chancellors in England, about the middle of the 19th Century at a time when English judges were little aware and wholly indifferent to what American courts were doing as a rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="4289.660" offset="17158583">Actually, the strongest authority it seems to be that can be cited for the proposition of fair use means what I have tried to say it means instead of what Mr. Carman says it means is the authority Judge Learned Hand who on two, at least two different occasions in the Second Circuit said this, “the question in any case is whether the part so taken is substantial and therefore not a fair use of the copyrighted work.”</text>

            <text syncTime="4445.437" offset="17781656">Even so, if we take the three criteria of Mr. Justice Story and they have been frequently repeated throughout the cases and assume that fair use means something more that just the ordinary test of substantiality, it seems to me we must arrive at the same conclusion which was reached both courts below.</text>

            <text syncTime="4545.942" offset="18183732">Because it represented all of the medical treaters substantially, all of the medical treaters had to say about it and it was a very prominent part of the advertisement into which it was it copied.</text>

            <text syncTime="4768.679" offset="19074612">Now as I said in the brief, of course, we have to suffer competition from television and from everyone else, but why, when we have a property right which the statute says is the exclusive, are we compelled to suffer that competition from our own material, taken without our authority and against our consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4792.565" offset="19170220">Then the third of the criteria, the purpose and object of selections made.</text>
            <text syncTime="4800.622" offset="19202403">If there is any unanimity on the doctrine of fair use both here and in England, it is on this proposition that the doctrine, no matter how liberal, does not justify one person simply for the purpose of earning a profit for himself, saving himself time, expense, and money by appropriating a substantial part of another's copyright material.</text>
            <text syncTime="4831.285" offset="19325074">Now if the profit motive is secondary in copyright as Mr. Carman has suggested, it occupies even a more subordinate position with respect to the second user who takes our material.</text>
            <text syncTime="4846.165" offset="19384633">And yet for what purpose was this material taken?</text>
            <text syncTime="4850.693" offset="19402710">And you cannot differentiate among Benny, CVS, or American in that respect because they were all engaged in the same enterprise and that enterprise was to advertise Lucky Strike cigarettes and that is all there is to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4865.186" offset="19460702">They need this entertainment material in order to attract an audience, because the commercial is no good unless somebody is listening to it and they are not going to get an audience by just telling them that the announcer is going to come on and tell them what a good smoke Lucky Strike is.</text>
            <text syncTime="4882.918" offset="19531651">The whole purpose of this entertainment material, a substantial part of which concededly they took from our copyright picture was taken in order to attract an audience so that Jack Benny and Don Wilson could tell that audience to smoke Lucky Strike cigarettes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4901.668" offset="19606570">Now that is a kind of a purpose that no fair use decision has ever, has ever countenanced.</text>
            <text syncTime="4912.171" offset="19648679">Nor is it the kind of a purpose which would countenance an ostensible criticism or review assuming that Eautolight ten years after the event is a review of Gaslight.</text>
            <text syncTime="4926.972" offset="19707820">There is a case in England that I think is pretty good on that subject Campbell against Scott.</text>
            <text syncTime="4936.120" offset="19744392">The defendant there had published what purported to be a critical review of the poetry and poets of the 19th Century.</text>
            <text syncTime="4945.989" offset="19783889">What it consisted of was a few pages of an introductory survey of 19th Century poetry and then a reprint of a great deal of poetry that had been written by 19th Century poets.</text>
            <text syncTime="4957.664" offset="19830596">It was in effect an anthology of poetry, although put out under the guise of being a critical assay.</text>
            <text syncTime="4966.172" offset="19864660">Well, Campbell objected.</text>
            <text syncTime="4967.229" offset="19868839">He did not want his poetry published without his permission, and what is, I suppose just as important, without getting compensated for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4974.402" offset="19897574">And the defense, as you might expect, was that this was just criticism, review, got to promote through the arts of sciences only tried one of the little gambit that Dr. Baxter introduced into his testimony here too that it was a compliment to the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="4996.030" offset="19984091">Dr. Baxter testified it is compliment to a person to be parodied, because you generally did not parody an unsuccessful work or an unsuccessful author.</text>
            <text syncTime="5003.558" offset="20014184">Well, in Campbell against Scott the defendant said that they considered they would have done Campbell a great injustice had they failed to take notice of him as one of the celebrated poets of the 19th Century and had reprinted samples of his work.</text>
            <text syncTime="5020.844" offset="20083357">Notwithstanding the English Court had no difficulty in determining that that was not fair use, but infringement of copyright and that the critical flavor to the book was merely a pretext or a guise.</text>

            <text syncTime="5114.422" offset="20457639">Now the only purpose or the only effect of criticism or review or parody for that matter, as I see it, is that it introduces some elements of flexibility into the standard of substantiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="5128.920" offset="20515631">In a bona fide or a bona fide review where there is no attempt simply to get the free ride on the other person's (Inaudible), well obviously, has presented for a different purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="5142.151" offset="20568503">You can, I think, very well indulge a more liberal factual test of how much is substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="5151.863" offset="20607373">And you can then, in now those cases, as court do, in these three tests of which Mr. Judge Story referred, they do not all have to go inside, and you find a greater or lesser emphasis on one or the other of them as the facts of the case seem to be appeal to the particular court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5168.313" offset="20673202">But when the purpose seems to be on honest one, when there is no attempt to get the free ride, as I say, courts tend to look more closely at the extent of injury if any to the plaintiff before a determination of substantiality.</text>
