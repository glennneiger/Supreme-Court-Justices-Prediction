            <text syncTime="23.268" offset="92996">Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices of the Supreme Court, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.158" offset="120581">We are here today, seeking reversal of a judgment entered in the District Court and affirmed in the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.583" offset="158302">The petitioner in the instant case was born in China in about 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.846" offset="187350">Some time prior to the Communist invasion, she and other members of the family moved to Hong Kong and took up residence in Hong Kong.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.615" offset="226429">In 1951, when she was 12 and a half years of age, her father submitted in her behalf an application for documentation with the American Consulate General at Hong Kong.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.155" offset="276584">American Consulate General issued documentation in the case and the girl proceeded to the port of entry of San Francisco, California.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.978" offset="315873">Subsequent to the time of her arrival in 1951, the Immigration and Naturalization Service determined that she had failed to reasonably establish her claimed relationship to her citizen father and therefore, her claim to United States nationality.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.976" offset="395807">As a result, they ordered her excluded and deported from the United States as an alien, not in possession of a proper immigration visa authorizing her admission for permanent residence.</text>

            <text syncTime="112.202" offset="448784">She was 12 and a half years of age at the time of her arrival.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.755" offset="470936">During the interim, prosecution had taken place.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.982" offset="491833">The Government in the prosecution contended that the parents and one other member of the family had committed perjury in a primary and preliminary statements made to officials of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.317" offset="541257">Those members of the family were indicted and they were acquitted.However, during the interim, they saw fit to parole her into the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.695" offset="582740">As a result, the proceedings in the instant case were not concluded for a considerable period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.035" offset="612101">The ultimate decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals was not arrived at until 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.135" offset="640522">In the early part of 1954, the petitioner received a notice to surrender for deportation to Communist China.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.634" offset="678452">And merely after following such notification, there was filed in her behalf with the District Director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service who is the respondent in the instant proceeding, an application for a stay or deportation on the grounds of physical persecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.856" offset="747416">Such application was filed, presumed to regulations and in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.848" offset="763298">It was contended in that petition that this -- this petitioner would suffer physical persecution, probable death and at least would be required to adhere to predispose to which she did not believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.520" offset="825992">The Immigration Service refused to accept such application, stating that she was not a person eligible for that relief, that merely following notification of that decision, a petition for a writ of habeas corpus was filed in the United States District Court of San Francisco.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.652" offset="894537">The Court, in its decision, reached a conclusion that the pleadings did not state facts sufficient to warrant the issue -- issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.316" offset="937169">The Circuit Court of the Ninth Circuit affirmed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.224" offset="952842">And I might state that at no time was the petitioner ever given a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.154" offset="972591">That no time was an order to show cause ever issued by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.794" offset="991086">No hearing was ever held.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.266" offset="1001012">Therefore, the only thing which we have before this Court are the pleadings on a petition for writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.039" offset="1032150">The similar question was presented to other -- two other Circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.583" offset="1054302">The Second Circuit held similar to the Ninth Circuit that persons excluded from admission to the United States were not persons within the United States, within the statutory language of Section 243 (h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952.</text>

            <text syncTime="1708.352" offset="6833319">I would like to state at the outset that the issue which is now before this Court, which wholly want a statutory construction is whether the Attorney General has any power to act under a certain provision of the Immigration and Nationalization Act of 1952, which speaks of withholding deportation of any alien within the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.070" offset="6952229">The question is whether he has any power to act under that particular Section of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.818" offset="6983262">There is presented in this case no question as to the validity of the orders excluding these aliens from the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.578" offset="7022237">Some reference is made to the fact that there was no hearing in this case and I want to make clear that the counsel for petitioner there refers to the fact that there was no hearing held on the application under 243 (h), because the Attorney General took the view that he had no power to act under that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.968" offset="7119830">There was of course a hearing on the earlier question of excludability of this alien and there is no question as to the validity of the orders which have excluded the alien in this case and in the succeeding case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1820.402" offset="7281580">He has ruled that this case doesn't come within those conditions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1828.443" offset="7313763">I'm saying that the Attorney General has said, that with respect to an alien who has been excluded from the United States albeit released on parole, there is no power to act under this particular Section of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.354" offset="7385339">Now, the Court will recall that on the motion of the Solicitor General, this case was held in advance, because the Solicitor General was of the view that there was power elsewhere in the statute, under which the Attorney General might grant parole, might continue parole, might continue the physical presence of the alien in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.543" offset="7502158">And that in considering whether to exercise the discretion given in that other Section of the statute, which is 212 (d) (5) and which appears at page 3 of the Government's brief, a relevant consideration would be whether the alien would be subject to physical persecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.856" offset="7579376">In other words, the question now before this Court, is not whether Congress has anywhere given the Attorney General power to act with respect to a claim of physical persecution by an excluded alien, but whether he has given -- whether Congress has given the Attorney General power to so act under Section 243 (h).</text>

            <text syncTime="1942.721" offset="7770802">Those applications have been denied by the Attorney General, acting through his delegate in the Immigration Service on the grounds among others that the petitioner failed to establish to the satisfaction of the service that she'd be subject to physical persecution in the country to which she was being sent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.828" offset="7859304">Now, the action under 212 (d) (5) is not now before this Court and I make reference to it, simply to emphasize again that the question is not whether there is any power in the Attorney General to act with respect to such a claim on the part of an excluded alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.264" offset="7953032">The question is whether that power is contained in 212 (d) (5).</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.032" offset="7976124">We agree that it is, whether it is also contained in 243 (h).</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.231" offset="8000888">The Attorney General has taken the view that it does not -- that the explicit phrase “deportation of any alien within the United States,” indicates that that provision has reference only to aliens who in legal contemplation, as well as in fact all within the United States.</text>
