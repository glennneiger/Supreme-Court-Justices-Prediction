            <label>Mr. George Cochran Doub</label>
            <text syncTime="15.017" offset="59977">If the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.760" offset="70949">These are three separate cases decided by the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.389" offset="101460">Each involves the proper scope of the Civil False Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.735" offset="130926">In the McNinch case, originating in South Carolina, the Fourth Circuit held that the Civil False Claims Act did not apply to fraudulent applications for loans guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.564" offset="210233">In the Toepleman case, originating in North Carolina, the Fourth Circuit held that the Civil False Claims Act did not apply to fraudulent applications for loans to the Commodity Credit Corporation because it was a wholly owned government corporation, and a wholly owned government corporation, according to the Fourth Circuit, is not a part of the Government of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.957" offset="339801">And in the Cato case, originating in the Eastern District of Virginia, the same decision was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.242" offset="372924">Now, the facts in the McNinch case were these, the defendants where the officers and -- and the salesmen of an unincorporated home construction business.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.880" offset="423497">They presented to a South Carolina bank, an FHA approved lending institution, a false and fraudulent FHA loan application on the forms of FHA for the purpose of obtaining FHA guaranteed loans for the construction or repair of homes.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.061" offset="540212">Now, the applications were fraudulent and fictitious.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.556" offset="562155">They included false credit reports in order to bring the applications within the eligibility provisions of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.454" offset="613773">Our complaint under the Civil False Claims Act alleged, the applications or claims were filed with the intent that they should be reported to and accepted by FHA for insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.234" offset="668839">That is the guarantee.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.135" offset="676467">Well, in reliance upon the integrity of the applications, the bank approved the loans, reported them to FHA, FHA guaranteed payment of the loans to the bank in the event of a default and the bank made the loan as guaranteed by FHA to these applicants.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.217" offset="780852">And those actual payments were obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.454" offset="789734">Now, the compliant further alleges a conspiracy by the defendants to defraud the United States under this -- the same provisions of the Civil False Claims Act and it alleges in that connection that the defendants obtained 2000 counterfeit credit report forms of a credit company for this fraudulent purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.974" offset="891820">Now, I might say, because great significance is attached to -- to this fact by the lower court and by the defendants, after the discovery of the fraud, but before these suits were instituted and before criminal suits were instituted, the defendants bought back these -- these notes, so there's been no default on the notes and there has been no loss by FHA.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.317" offset="1025254">Now, the facts in these cases are typical of thousands referred by the FHA to the Department of Justice originating all over the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.243" offset="1080947">As a matter of fact, this type of fraud, our experience shows that my division is more prevalent numerically.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.250" offset="1120967">We have more cases numerically of this type than under any government program.</text>

            <text syncTime="330.781" offset="1323050">Now, let me remind you of the provisions of the Civil False Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.894" offset="1347500">It provides for the payment to the United States of the sum of $2000 as liquidated damages or imputed damages or forfeitures, as to each fraudulent claim, and in addition, double the amount of actual damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.041" offset="1420121">It's applicable to anyone who makes or causes to be made or presents or causes to be presented a false claim, for payment or for approval, by any person or officer in the civil -- civil service of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.829" offset="1487308">And it covers any claim upon or against the Government of the United States or any department or officer thereof, and it also applies to obtaining or aiding to obtain so it is a broad, comprehensive statute and there are no qualifying or exclusionary clauses.</text>

            <label>Mr. George Cochran Doub</label>
            <text syncTime="407.764" offset="1630981">Well, the record doesn't show that, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.726" offset="1646864">In Marcus against Hess, Mr. Justice Black said for the -- for unanimous Court on this point in interpreting the Civil False Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.216" offset="1704856">He said if -- the Court said it is a civil remedial statute and not a penal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.367" offset="1729411">It's to be accorded the fair meaning of its intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.159" offset="1744562">It was immaterial that the false claims were filed against a third party and not directly with the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.919" offset="1779670">In other words, there, they were filed with their municipality.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.463" offset="1805793">And here, they were filed with a South Carolina bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.092" offset="1824287">It was also -- you also held that the object of a statute was to provide protection against those who would cheat the United States and to reach any person without regard to whether that person had direct contractual relations with the Government, and that is also true here.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.636" offset="1910491">The Court also held that the test of application of the Act was whether, ultimately and eventually, there might result payment of government money.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.231" offset="1956885">I might say that in that case, that was a case where fraudulent claims were asserted by contractors against a municipality which was under contract with PWA.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.971" offset="2031804">In other words, PWA was supplying a great deal of the funds for the construction of this municipal public improvement.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.626" offset="2074436">And so, though the false claims were presented to the municipality, the loss was ultimately born by the Treasury of the United States, although not in -- in its entirety, only in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.322" offset="2137234">Now, the Fourth Circuit followed the opinion of the Third Circuit with Chief Judge Biggs dissenting in the opinion in the Cochran case of the Fifth Circuit with Judge Reed dissenting, holding that such fraudulent applications did not constitute claims against the Government within the meaning of the False Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.225" offset="2280803">Now, the -- these circuits strictly interpreted the word “claim” in the False Claims Act as a demand for money or property as a right, and since no demands were made for the payment of the loans, the Act did not cover the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.568" offset="2346214">And the opinion suggests that if there had been an actual default on the loans, and if there had been an actual payment by FHA, then the Act would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.572" offset="2394279">But here, these applications were made upon FHA titled loan credit forms, here the defendants made the fraudulent applications with the objective and intent in understanding that they would be reported to and accepted by FHA for guarantees.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.866" offset="2467422">Here, they knew the bank wouldn't have made these loans except for the Government's guarantee.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.877" offset="2491455">Now, what was the essence of this transaction?</text>
            <text syncTime="628.328" offset="2513293">Upon FHA approval of this bank, which happened before these applications were filed, and upon the filing of these applications on these FHA forms, with the representations made in -- in them, that brought them within the scope of the Act and entitled them to the loan, and entitle the bank to the guarantee of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.094" offset="2624366">And when the bank made that guarantee, it became unqualifiedly committed as the guarantor of any future losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.519" offset="2658011">So, we say that these applications were in reality and practically in -- in substance directed against the assets of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.448" offset="2697718">And it's our position that the word “claim” under the statute goes beyond a simple demand for the immediate payment of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.084" offset="2740245">Here, the claim, the fraudulent claim was to the pledge of the credit of the United States and it was that guarantee which we made, and we say that guarantee was a property.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.692" offset="2822687">Now, you'll notice this no restrictive language in the statute as to the word “claim”.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.967" offset="2839824">It says, any claim, which would ordinarily mean all claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.276" offset="2857064">It refers not merely to payment, but payment or approval of a fraudulent claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.294" offset="2885172">Now, the Third Circuit and the Fifth Circuit interpret this statute as directed the claims for money or property.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.251" offset="2924983">We don't object to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.389" offset="2933551">And -- and I think that's undoubtedly so, but we say the word “property” shouldn't have been restricted by those circuits to tangible property, that, of course, it covers property in its ordinary sense, tangibles or intangibles.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="749.574" offset="2998230">Does the Government remain or the FHA remain on the hook, once it is discovered that there has been a fraudulent application for a loan?</text>

            <label>Mr. George Cochran Doub</label>
            <text syncTime="758.725" offset="3034802">If the bank is at -- if the bank did not know of the misrepresentations, the -- the Government has logged on its contract to guarantee.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.566" offset="3066253">So, all we're -- the -- the real issue in this case we -- we submit is this, is a contract of guarantee -- is a pledge to the credit of the United States property, if so, this was a claim for property under the Civil False Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.397" offset="3149531">Now, we say property should be deemed to include a franchise, a patent, a copyright, a contract of insurance, a contract of guarantee, a contract of indemnity, any that shows an action of any legal right.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.732" offset="3214838">I might remind you of what this Court said in the Arenz case in 290 U.S. 66, which I don't think is on our brief, in construing the word “property” in a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.522" offset="3262067">We said -- it's Fidelity and Deposit Company against Arenz, 290 U.S. 66.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.751" offset="3294981">And this is a way you construe the word “property” in a federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.131" offset="3316506">Property is a word of very broad meaning and when used without qualification, expressly made or plainly implied, it reasonably may be construe to include obligations, rights and other intangibles as well as physical things.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.003" offset="3387977">And then in Lynch against United States in 292 U.S., and an opinion by Justice Brandeis who held at War Risk Insurance policies being contracts for property and created vested rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.872" offset="3447432">And so, we say here, that FHA applications, fraudulent ones, that these defendants for a loan guaranteed by FHA were a claim for a contract of indemnity.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.369" offset="3517440">Now, the -- the Third Circuit and the Fifth Court and the Fourth Circuit has made -- made another false distinction, we believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.601" offset="3570312">They say that the test of liability is whether that's what's involved on the loan, which suggest that the Government, after discovering a fraud, would sit idly by to ascertain whether a default occurred before the six-year statute of limitation as far as the action, or see whether the defrauders -- would accord the defrauders an opportunity to buy the notes in case of a default to prevent a call upon the guarantee.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.296" offset="3709179">Of course, it would be practically an invitation to fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.172" offset="3720673">It would be an engine of fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.609" offset="3726420">It would be an invitation to take a gamble.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.018" offset="3743974">If the fraud isn't discovered, there's no problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.513" offset="3762051">If fraud is discovered, buy the notes back, and you could have a loss of evidence, the Government has to wait after it discovers the fraud for -- for perhaps years.</text>

            <text syncTime="968.784" offset="3875109">And I accept that.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.450" offset="3885767">Now, it's not necessary under this statute, if the Court please, that the Government suffer a pecuniary loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.784" offset="3919099">The statute isn't in terms of loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.047" offset="3932160">The wrongful act is not the obtaining of money or property by fraud, it's not defrauding the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.961" offset="3971762">The wrongful act, the offense is not cheating the Government, but it is attempting to cheat the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.166" offset="4004571">Then Mr. Justice Black said in his opinion in Marcus against Hess, it applies to those who would cheat the Government of the United States and then the -- the $2000 liquidated damage, a forfeiture provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.841" offset="4075311">Obviously, it designed to cover, to impute damages to the Government, although, it maybe unable to prove any.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.424" offset="4121600">Though the statute assumes an injury by that forfeiture provision, it imputes liquated damages and that -- are desirable, because whenever there is an attempted fraud, though not successful, is investigative expense and clerical expense and legal expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.054" offset="4204147">So, we say there is no requirement statutory or judicial that specific damages be shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.267" offset="4241032">In Rex Trailer Company, Mr. Justice Clark said for the Court in -- for unanimous Court in that case, and that the language of that statute, the Surplus Property Act, was somewhat similar to this, it can be distinguished but he said the fact that no damages are shown is not fatal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.815" offset="4319190">And we say his language there should be applied here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.086" offset="4348343">So, we suggest respectfully that there is no valid distinction between default and pre-default claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.450" offset="4381780">The distinction made is artificial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.453" offset="4393796">It's unrealistic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.498" offset="4401946">And so, it follows that when there is a fraudulent application, a fraudulent claim for a guaranteed FHA loan, the statute has been violated, and that is the wrongful act, filing the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.860" offset="4455340">And that wrongful act, which is its basis, is the same, whether there is a loss, actual loss by the government or not, default is not critical, but the filing of the false claim is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.019" offset="4508003">Now, that brings me to the Toepleman case and the Cato case, one is in North Carolina and one from Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.332" offset="4549277">There, the Government brought suits under the same Civil False Claims Act for alleged frauds upon the Commodity Credit Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.885" offset="4595461">Commodity Credit had authorized the defendant corporations as Commodity's agents to make non-recourse loans to purchasers of eligible 1948 crop cut.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.537" offset="4666096">Now, the defendants submitted to Commodity Credit Corporation hundreds of notes, fraudulent notes of alleged cotton producers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1190.685" offset="4762645">As a matter of fact, the note makers had sold their cotton to the defendants and had no further interest in the cotton.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.381" offset="4797440">And the defendants persuaded and are induced the producers of the cotton to sign these notes or -- or rather applications, these false statements that they had produced the cotton even after they had purchased their cotton and they had no further interest in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.653" offset="4886570">They also falsely certified that the benefit of the loan would accrue solely to the note maker and that was untrue because they -- they weren't going accrue to the note makers, they were going to accrue to the defendants who had purchased this cotton.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.801" offset="4963161">They also falsely alleged the benefits below, and it had not been transferred to any other party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.530" offset="4990119">Now, on the basis of these false statements, the defendants obtained payment of these fraudulent notes from the Commodity Credit Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.926" offset="5043618">Now, actually they made no dispersement to the purchasers or rather to the producers, the latter having no interest in them and they retained these commodity payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.803" offset="5099207">In other words, here was just a fraudulent scheme of some cotton brokers to protect themselves from loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.501" offset="5137972">The price of cotton went up, and probably that was one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.845" offset="5167334">But if the price of cotton fell, this cotton they had bought from the real producers, then they would be protected by obtaining these payments on these fraudulent notes from the Commodity Credit Corporation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2762.132" offset="11048438">Now, I was talking about this statute and I think that that is the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.451" offset="11061708">Now, the Government has known about this government corporation technicality since 1938.</text>

            <text syncTime="2803.239" offset="11212904">Now, they are found to argue that a functional approach or expediency, if you will, is to make a note, the Act of Congress which Mr. Justice Harlan referred to in 1918, and to change the intent of Congress in 1878 which was the last time the statute was amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.544" offset="11310080">This case involves, if you please, the construction of a criminal statute, 5438 of the Revised Statutes, as they'd existed in 1878 and that criminal statute, if you please, should not be extended by interpretation and in line with fundamental principles, it must define a criminal act with certainty.</text>

            <text syncTime="2944.678" offset="11778612">Now, Revised Statutes 5438, which were incorporated as we have seen, define the crime, and this is a criminal statute which we say cannot be extended by interpretation and must define the crime of reasonable service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.902" offset="11859592">As it existed in -- in 1878, that statute did not say anything about the government corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.734" offset="11898880">It didn't know anything about government corporations, except the Smithsonian Institute which merely said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.715" offset="11922808">But this is -- part of the fact that that statute has been off, it has been amended, repealed, reenacted and as Mr. Justice Harlan pointed out in 1918, they came in and included a government corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.678" offset="11986651">And incidentally, it was not a partially owned government corporation because Mr. Justice Holmes in U.S. against Walter, if it please the Court, said it was such a corporation that -- that was totally owned by the Government and it had to be or else the law would have been unconstitutional, the amendment would have been unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.428" offset="12065646">And it specifically held that it was limited to such corporations as were instrumentalities of the United States, so I think that put such questions to rest.</text>

            <text syncTime="3282.306" offset="13129143">Now, we say that this modern trend argument is trying to put an amendment now into this criminal statute which is not there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.042" offset="13184104">But it was put there in 1918, put there by Congress, which meant that it wasn't covered before Congress put it there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.789" offset="13227154">Now, one comment about our facts that I want to go into the legislative history and the judicial decisions, it was found as a matter of fact that our claims were submitted to the Commodity Credit Corporation, not the United States Government, and it was found as a matter of fact that the Government suffered no legally recoverable damages in our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.012" offset="13396010">With the amendments which I shall take, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, it seems highly important that we must search the meaning of Section 5438 of the Revised Statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.210" offset="13456823">As it existed, or what it meant in 1878, as it has been shown to have been interpreted since that time, and we look to the legislative history and we look to judicial opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.725" offset="13510844">Now, the -- this legislative history shows clearly that Congress did not intend to cover a government corporation, about 5438 in 1878 and that their cases show that they -- it didn't -- it didn't cover, it did not cover.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.637" offset="13578449">Now, it's already been pointed out that 5438 makes it a crime to present a claim against the Government of the United States, Department of the United States or any officer that govern, that's all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.829" offset="13635291">Now, while it's true that this was 3490 should be construed broadly to protect the Treasury, still in 1918 after 5438 had gone through various amendments and become Section 35 of the Criminal Code, if you please, in 1918, Section 35 was amended by Congress to include or any corporation in which the United States of America is a stockholder, and that means as we have seen that it must be such a corporation as to be an instrumentality of the United States, not just any corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.810" offset="13799236">Congress was too broad, it would have been unconstitutional if it had been that board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.986" offset="13819925">Now, was this amendment an extension of the terms of the law or was it just a clarification?</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.783" offset="13859109">We think that we can show clearly that it wasn't extension.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.974" offset="13879798">Now, the committee reports in talking of that amendment had this to say, representative guard says, the amendment served to fully reenact and reinforce the provisions of Section 35 of the Criminal Code, so that it will include all the offense heretofore contained there in, and an offense against any corporation in which the United States is a stockholder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.488" offset="14001946">Again, when it was explained the Bill, Mr. Representative (Inaudible), said, "The only amendments to the existing laws are the extension of the penalty of this Act to false and fraudulent claims that are presented against corporations in which the United States is a stockholder," an extension if you will.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.510" offset="14094002">Once again, when the Bill was received from the Senate, Mr. (Inaudible) said, “This amendment”, and I have to quote him, “At Section 35 as amended to extend the law to false and fraudulent claims made against a corporation in which the United Stated is a stockholder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.699" offset="14178743">Well, if they were going to extend the law to the corporations in which the United States was a stockholder, it could never applied prior to 1918."</text>

            <text syncTime="3806.046" offset="15224163">Now, after he was indicted and before the case got to this Court, Congress changed Section 32 to include all any corporation in which the United States of America is a stockholder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3820.849" offset="15283304">This Court, speaking to Mr. Justice Reed said, “The statute in effect at the time of the commission of the alleged defenses did not speak of pretenses of acting under authority of corporations owned or controlled by the United States.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3837.856" offset="15351327">It was passed in 1884, six years later than (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="3844.358" offset="15377345">It was passed in 1884 before the United States owned or controlled corporations operating hotels, boat lines of generating plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3853.976" offset="15415902">The amendments, subsequent to the occasion fixed by the indictment, extended its scope first to the Home Owners' Loan Corporation and later to all corporations owned or controlled by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3865.343" offset="15461355">These legislative extensions of the scope of the Act were in accord with the growing importance of the administrative corporation but a comparable judicial enlargement of a criminal act by interpretation is at war with the fundamental concept of the common law that crimes must be defined with appropriate definiteness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3888.403" offset="15553515">Now, we say sir that 5438, as it existed in 1878, cannot be extended by interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3902.626" offset="15610462">I have already cited the Salzman and Salant and the Gilchrist cases decided in 1938, 20 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3910.761" offset="15642958">Now, the Rainwater case says that the Section 5438 should be liberally construed, and I think there is a little bit of confusion in that decision, because while we admit that 3490, a civil remedy must be liberally construed, 5438, the criminal section, the incorporated statute, if you please, cannot be and should not be liberally construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3943.967" offset="15775765">Now, the Hess case has been cited and rightly so, we cite the Hess case to show that you cannot say that 5438 has one meaning when it is incorporated in the civil statute and another meaning when you read it as a criminal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3967.220" offset="15868865">Mr. Justice Black's opinion there amply shows that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3980.745" offset="15922887">He says, “True, 5438 is criminal and for that reason, in interpreting so much of its language as it shares in common with 3490, we must give it careful scrutiny lest those be brought within its reach who are not clearly included.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4003.589" offset="16014315">Then again, on page 542 of the opinion, he says, "This qui tam policy, allowing informers to institute civil suit under Section 3490,” which incidentally has now been written over the law, “cannot be used to detract from the meaning of the language in the criminal section and we cannot say that the same substantive language has one meaning if criminal prosecutions are brought by public officials and quite a different meaning whether same language is invoked civilly by an informant.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4038.280" offset="16153078">Now, the Hess case is not the same case as our case, in the first place, the Hess case did not involve a government corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4049.167" offset="16196650">The Hess case announces a rule of construction of Section 3490 and the informer statutes, if you please.</text>
            <text syncTime="4058.579" offset="16234266">But we say, in our case, you don't have to construe it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4061.343" offset="16245342">Why, because Congress itself has said what it meant when dealing with a government corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4067.687" offset="16270733">We read the -- the legislative history, Congress said what it meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4072.394" offset="16289541">The cases have said that it did not prior to 1980, and 5438 did not reach a – this crime of a false claim against the government corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4086.425" offset="16345652">It is interesting to note that in the opinion, in the Hess case, the Court deals with the fact that in 1863, which was the time this informer's act first started and that federal aid to states was known, it was in the minds of Congress and it dwells on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4110.420" offset="16441678">On the other hand, I point to the opinion in the Pierce case, which says in 1884, six years after our statute, the concept of the government corporation was not in the minds of Congress and it could not be.</text>

            <text syncTime="4258.595" offset="17034344">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4262.759" offset="17050958">I represent the McNinch portion of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4266.424" offset="17065691">I'd like to clarify a few factual situations for the purpose of -- of dismissing the complaint, of course, we had to admit the allegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4277.698" offset="17110727">What happened actually in the McNinch case was that the McNinch people were contractors operating and repairing houses, and in turn, they finance their customers to Title 1 policies ensured by the FHA.</text>
            <text syncTime="4297.212" offset="17188780">Now, the direct question we have here is whether or not an application where they actually ballooned the -- the financial resources of the applicant, who owned the house, who was getting the loans, the loans made in his name, not in McNinch's name, but then went to the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="4320.078" offset="17280209">Our sole question here, as I see it, with the exception of what Mr. Epps has put forward and I believe FHA as far as they intend one of the statute go is the same as the government corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4332.570" offset="17330260">But the main question here is the question of whether or not the ballooning of an application for loan to be made by bank to a third party constitutes a claim within the contemplation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4351.779" offset="17407060">Now, this case has been decided by United States versus Cochran, 235 F.2d 131 certiorari denied 352 U.S. 941, and also by United States versus Tieger, 234 F.2d 589, certiorari denied 352 U.S. 941.</text>
            <text syncTime="4375.508" offset="17501936">The facts are the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="4379.130" offset="17516460">I think, hereto, we've got to look to what Congress meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4383.825" offset="17535269">Now, two of our people were prosecuted under Section 1010 Title 18 U.S.C.</text>
            <text syncTime="4391.889" offset="17567556">It appears on page 8 of the McNinch's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4397.506" offset="17590021">Now, in the 5438, which is the False Claims statute, a criminal statute, the penalties were five years or $10,000, and that was a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="4411.198" offset="17644774">In 1010 to which two of our people plead guilty, the criminal penalty is two years or $5000.</text>
            <text syncTime="4423.685" offset="17694720">Now this statute was enacted, as I understand in 1939, and deals entirely with what we have here, statements to the FHA --</text>

            <text syncTime="4439.224" offset="17756891">No sir, 1010 is not here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4440.791" offset="17763161">I was trying to point out that what our people were convicted of was a lesser crime and a statute much broader in scope than the original False Claims statute and the civil count for it as is here now, 1010 deals primarily with exactly what happens and the whole essence of it says, anything that you do to influence FHA to make somebody else a loan so that it can be ensured is criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4474.148" offset="17896490">And as was said in the -- in the Cochran case, certainly our people were properly prosecuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4484.133" offset="17936509">Well, what is said in the Cochran case, I believe, is true here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4489.026" offset="17956049">What the Government is trying to do is to read into Section 538 which is now Section 231, the civil portion of the 3349, is to read into 231 that same language as is contained in 1010.</text>
            <text syncTime="4507.953" offset="18031804">And that isn't possible because in order to be guilty under the Hess case, and Mr. Justice Black so stated, “In order to be guilty under the civil portion of the False Claims Act, you had to have committed the Act under the criminal act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4526.722" offset="18106828">So, actually, you have to have the same counterpart for both the civil act and the criminal act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4533.109" offset="18132428">Now what our people did was an act -- criminal act under Section 1010.</text>
            <text syncTime="4540.903" offset="18163566">I would assume that the Government thought that the acts that our people committed were not such that could have been -- they could have been prosecuted under the False Claims statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4555.253" offset="18220931">Certainly, Congress didn't apparently think that on this representation as concerns on influence for an FHA loans to a lending institution certainly didn't think that that fell within the False Claims statute or act they -- or else they wouldn't have enacted the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4574.845" offset="18299298">Now, I think Mr. Hastie in Tieger hit the nail right on the head and I might -- I would like to point out here that I believe Mr. Doub said that all three of the cases are both the Third, the Fifth and the Fourth Circuit seem to think that this might have someday become a claim if there had been any loss of money by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="4604.577" offset="18418207">I think the only reference that I can find and remember is the statement in the Tieger case where Judge Hastie said, “True, the contract, Tieger, induced might have led to what undoubtedly would be considered a claim against the United States but it never did.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4621.915" offset="18487589">And he goes on further to say, “Tieger did the same McNinch did.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4626.091" offset="18504307">He says, “And certainly, there is no indication that Tieger intended or even anticipated any default by the Bar and a consequent claim on the guarantor.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4641.783" offset="18567105">Now, what the Government is saying here is that an application made by a third party probably prepared by McNinch, what it was -- I think what happened was McNinch knew that you had to have a certain amount of income and when he filled out these application banks, he boosted their income a little bit, the man signed it, sent it down to the bank along with the other necessary papers, the bank made him the loan and then the bank for a premium that pays FHA, sends it off to FHA and ask them to insure it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4677.857" offset="18711406">Now, FHA, true, is bound if the bank acted in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="4685.552" offset="18742126">But the bank does not have to go against the insurance, doesn't have to make this claim, most of the time, in small amount as like this, if there is a default, they prefer to collect how much security they have.</text>
            <text syncTime="4699.652" offset="18798550">But the question is, can the ballooning on that application in any sense of the meaning of the statute in 1878 be a claim?</text>
            <text syncTime="4711.114" offset="18844421">Cochran says it was not, Tieger says it was not, there wasn't intended to be one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4716.892" offset="18867513">Certainly, it have to be within the purview of the statute --</text>
