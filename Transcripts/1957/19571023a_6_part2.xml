            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">Mr. Howland, you may proceed.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Alden B. Howland</label>
            <text syncTime="10.641" offset="42527">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.822" offset="47229">At the time of the recess, I was discussing the fact that there was complete absence of any evidence in this record that would justify the conclusion that the operations of Rock Island Motor Transit Company had in anyway been harmful to the so-called independent motor carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.884" offset="179513">Now, that is demonstrated in a number of ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.890" offset="195500">First, it appears without dispute in this record that all of the independent motor carriers in the area have increased their traffic in the 10 years or nine years immediately preceeding the hearing at a much greater rate than have the -- then has Rock Island Motor Transit Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.327" offset="297273">The Rock Island Motor Transit Company has an increase of roughly 50% in its gross volume of tonnage handled during that period, whereas some of the competitors who are appellants here in this case have increased the volume of revenues and tonnage handles by as much 300%.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.896" offset="399569">And we think that, quite inclusively, demonstrates that there's no basis for the claim that the operations of Rock Island Motor Transit Company while they were conducted on a nonrestricted basis were predatory in nature or in any manner that it interfered with the logical development of the motor carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.959" offset="495804">Now, it also appears in this record and there is no dispute about that fact and no evidence to the contrary that during the time since the Rock Island Motor Transit acquired the White Line routes that Rock Island Motor Transit has cooperated with motor carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.410" offset="581590">Some of its officers and employees have served on the rate bureaus.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.033" offset="600085">They have participated in the motor carrier organizations and have been highly regarded by the other motor carriers, some of whom are appellants in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.598" offset="654315">And there's not syllable of evidence to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.297" offset="677094">Now, I believe it was Mr. Justice Harlan who propounded it to Mr. Ginnane, a question as to whether there was anything in the briefs that indicated the extent to which the Commission, in prior cases, had granted unrestricted motor carrier authority to rail subsidiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.876" offset="795481">At pages 17 and 18 of our brief, we set forth, I believe, its 12 separate instances beginning with the Santa Fe Trail Stages case and including St. Andrews Bay down to the Southern Pacific control of Pacific Motor Trucking purchase of Lowa Trucking Company in which the Commission said that because of the circumstances that were disclosed in the particular record that they found it unnecessary to impose any restrictions upon the operations of rail subsidiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.248" offset="972904">Now, as cited, there are two cases in which Rock Island Motor Transit itself was granted unrestricted authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.758" offset="1006968">One, being a short route between Wellman and Iowa, City of Iowa serving, I believe, two intermediate points and one between Clinton Davenport and Muscatine, Iowa which were rail routes -- rail points and as to which in an -- in a -- an acquisition case.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.412" offset="1105607">The -- no conditions were imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.088" offset="1120340">We have had other instances such as the Atlantic Motor Freight case which was not reported in the MCC reports of the Commerce Commission where no restriction -- restrictions were imposed.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="294.776" offset="1179063">Mr. Howland, I wonder I might ask, why -- why there's a new proceeding initiated here rather than to pursue a modification that the longstanding orders that have -- had been made in this case.</text>

          <turn speaker="alden_b_howland" startTime="314.373" stopTime="393.160">
            <label>Mr. Alden B. Howland</label>
            <text syncTime="314.373" offset="1257430">Well, frankly, it was the dealing of those who were handling the matter, including myself, that there would probably be a greater degree of evidence admissible and a greater flexibility in the -- in the showing that we wanted to make if we proceeded under Section 207.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.825" offset="1363278">And I think as I recall that there was a suggestion or two from the Commission staff that we might as well open the whole thing up.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.266" offset="1429002">And it was upon that basis that we filed an application first in accordance with the restriction which had been imposed to 5000 pounds maximum weight limitation and later we amended that when we found that through practical experience that it was unworkable and it was not serving the communities to which the Rock Island Motor Transit had the only operating authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="413.356" offset="1653342">Well, I don't think that the -- that you can circumvent the provisions of Section 5 (2) (b), I think, that it's absolutely necessary that the Commission make the finding that is set forth there.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.804" offset="1715200">But I say that the Commission in its discretion having made that finding, having approved the acquisition, the extent of the limitations or restrictions which are to be imposed, if any, is a matter, I believe, within the sound discretion of the Commission and where the evidence --</text>
