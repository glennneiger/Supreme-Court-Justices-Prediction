            <label>Mr. Roger D. Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="21.056" offset="84219">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court?</text>
            <text syncTime="27.193" offset="108669">These cases, here on appeal from the Supreme Court of Michigan, involved the validity of a Michigan Statute which explicitly imposes a special tax on the lessees and users of tax exempt property.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.528" offset="190067">You have three numbers, three cases here, number 26, to the United States and Borg-Warner against Detroit involves a defense plant which is owned by the United States and Detroit and leased to Borg-Warner.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.629" offset="250462">Number 37, number 38 are separate appeals by the United States and by Continental Motors involving a defense plant in Muskegon, Michigan which is owned by the United States and occupied and used by the Continental Motors Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.346" offset="333322">Although three cases are here consolidated for argument, you have only two, in substance two cases, the Muskegon case and the Detroit case that is the Continental case in Muskegon and the Borg-Warner case in Detroit.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.312" offset="401241">Unlike the case we just were arguing, there is no dispute about the ownership of this property or who owns it or what title means.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.287" offset="449097">Again unlike the (Inaudible) case, this is not a general tax levied on everybody equally in Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.450" offset="489744">The facts of the two cases are sufficiently different, so we will have to state them separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.940" offset="511687">The plant in Detroit is a naval industrial reserve plant owned by the United States for a number of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.150" offset="540526">In 1947, in the Military Leasing Act, Congress authorized long-term leases on defense plants which should be available on a standby basis which were not currently needed for defense production.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.353" offset="601339">Under a negotiated lease effective in 1948, dated 1950, this plant was leased to the Borg-Warner Corporation for five years, and options on their part to extend for three additional terms and five years each.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.613" offset="670407">The lease was revived and extended in 1958, until 1958 and 1953 effective till 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.921" offset="711680">Under the lease, Borg-Warner leases the bulk, almost all of plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.989" offset="731951">This includes a storage area in which all the machine tools owned by the United States in the plant are stored and a manufacturing area in which Borg-Warner uses for its own private commercial purposes unconnected with national defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.678" offset="794645">Borg-Warner has a duty to maintain the storage area and to oil and grease and make sure the equipment there is in an operating, usable condition and upon termination of the lease Borg-Warner must reinstall all the machine tools back to their places in the manufacturing area and throughout the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.329" offset="885238">The lease is subject to cancellation upon declaration of a national emergency by the President or upon 120 days notice by the Secretary of the Navy in the interest of national defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.848" offset="943334">In 1953, Michigan adopted Public Act number 189, an Act to provide for the taxation of lessees and users of tax exempt property.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.675" offset="994638">As of January 1, 1954, Detroit assessed the tax against Borg-Warner under this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.588" offset="1030269">The Board of Assessors valued the property precisely as it would have done had such real property been owned in free simple and occupied by Borg-Warner Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.029" offset="1076036">That is the stipulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.052" offset="1084186">They assessed this just as a real property tax assessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.486" offset="1109891">Property was assessed at some $350,000 and the tax was something over $12,000 was imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.451" offset="1133714">Borg-Warner paid the tax under protest and on September 1954, the United States and Borg-Warner together joined in bringing suit as plaintiffs for a refund of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.570" offset="1198184">At the time of the renewal of the lease, effective 1953 which was actually negotiated in 1954, the lease included a provision that United Sates would be responsible for this tax if it were valid, but that it would be contested and Borg-Warner would cooperate in contesting the validity of the tax, full burden of the tax if imposed or if recovered in this case, it subsequently felt benefits or hurts the United State.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.711" offset="1314795">In the lower -- it was alleged that Act 189 was repugnant to the Constitution and that authorized taxation of property owned by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.838" offset="1351262">Both the Circuit Court of Wayne County and the Supreme Court of Michigan upheld the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.434" offset="1381669">Supreme Court of Michigan stated the tax was not a tax on the property nor on the leasehold interest, but and I quote “A specific tax on the privilege of using the property.”</text>
            <text syncTime="359.783" offset="1439033">United States and Borg-Warner both appealed to this Court, which noted probable jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.713" offset="1462753">Numbers 37 and 38 involving the defense plant in Muskegon --</text>

            <text syncTime="379.103" offset="1516356">At the time when the first lease was negotiated, it was assumed the taxed property was not taxable and that there would be no tax equivalent to the real estate taxes imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.238" offset="1560869">The lease was negotiated on that terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.583" offset="1570273">At each five-year interval the terms of lease are subject to renegotiation.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.706" offset="1586782">When the first five years was over, which occurred in 1953, and negotiated from 1953 to 1954 and adopted the definitive terms, in the renegotiation of the lease rather than raise their -- lower their rent because they were having a burden of a tax or speculate on that because of the tax, it was agreed that the United States would -- by contract the United States assumed full burden of this tax in order to get the lease terms as satisfactory to the United States as they were.</text>

            <text syncTime="525.031" offset="2100036">Of course the government can give (Inaudible) if it wants to, that's a totally different -- that isn't your proposition here that it came (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="533.102" offset="2132323">Your proposition is that when this contract, when this lease was made, which the government was free to make or not free to make, necessarily as a matter of law, immunity results from it, because of the relation of the arrangement to the United Sates.</text>

            <text syncTime="564.242" offset="2256875">At that point the United States leased out to Borg-Warner, let them use the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.719" offset="2282789">The contention of Michigan is they may now impose a tax on that privilege of using the government plant, the tax exempt plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.265" offset="2316957">That -- we contend that this tax is a substantive tax on the plant and that it is not permitted either under the implied immunity or under congressional action in this field.</text>
