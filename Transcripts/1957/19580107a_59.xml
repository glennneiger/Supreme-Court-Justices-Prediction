            <text syncTime="97.017" offset="387971">The traffic clauses in question are covenants or agreements contained in -- in contract sale and leases of land by which the purchaser or a lessee agrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.503" offset="457979">That rates being equal and that he has (Inaudible) rates and services being equal.</text>

            <text syncTime="153.707" offset="614818">It's a part of the consideration, the Railway Company gets for making the contract or lease to the purchaser or lessee of its land, that it shall enjoin the transportation of the products.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.537" offset="698096">Provided, it can hold to the destination he wishes to reach and provided also that the rates are equal to those of any competitors as of many instances, if rates and services are equal to any competitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.105" offset="764343">Now, the evidence in the record is that even though the work and services may not have been included in many of this contracts, the administration over a period of years that is during the entire period as used to this clauses, which I might say goes back to 1887, has been to apply a rule of reason and not to expect the business unless it was convened, the shipper to use the railroad of Northern Pacific.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.236" offset="924944">Now, the -- the judgement was not based on any evidence that these traffic clauses had actually resulted in harm in competition or detriment of any kind to producers or consumers of transportation services or to the lessees or purchasers of Northern Pacific lines themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.298" offset="1045107">It was based upon the view of the District Court that on the admitted facts established by the pleadings and by responses to request for admission, certain stipulation of the fact and the depositions that were taken on behalf of the appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.332" offset="1145313">The case came squarely within a formula derived from the so-called tying cases, which the District Court state is as false.</text>

            <text syncTime="308.942" offset="1235696">When one, a seller or lessor enjoying market control of a particular commodity in contracts for the sale or lease of such commodity requires a buyer or a lessee to purchase a distinctive difference in separate commodity.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.588" offset="1326289">And second, the amount of interstate commerce in the tied commodity is not insignificant or insubstantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.757" offset="1362965">The tying arrangement is illegal per se under Section 1 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.846" offset="1403298">Now, before discussing the Court's decision arising at the conclusion of the facts in this case brought up within the formula stated, I should like to state briefly the undisputed fact to their establishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.214" offset="1488771">The Northern Pacific Railway Company is a common carrier, Railroad Corporation which is the successor to railroad and plan event of a federal corporation of substantially the same name created by the Act of July 2, 1864.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.956" offset="1587722">Northwestern Improvement Company is the wholly owned subsidiary of Northern Pacific which was organized for the purpose of taking over a portion of the land, granted lands, which the Railway Company acquired from the predecessors in order to keep them out under the mortgages of the Railway Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.830" offset="1683226">And also to engage in the operation of certain coal mines supplying the Railway Company with coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.826" offset="1711229">It has at all times been operated as the department of the Railway Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.774" offset="1735053">The land department of the Railway Company can be also the land department of Northwestern Improvement Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.361" offset="1769430">Now, the -- the land grants to which Northern Pacific succeeded, consisted of each (Inaudible) section to a distance of 20 miles on each side of the line where it passed through States and 40 miles on each side of the line where it passed to -- to a territory with a right to take indemnity land into indemnity belt each 10 miles beyond the limit of the place (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="485.771" offset="1942988">The Railroad of the Northern Pacific was built pursuant to the offer of this land grant and it was constructed through the Northern States from the Kevin's Lake Superior to fuse itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.895" offset="2023549">The purpose of the traffic act, the purpose of construction of the railroad was to provide transportation facility to what was then the language of this Court, hopeless prairie, trackless forest and unexplored mountains.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.268" offset="2109022">It was able to develop the territory and its settlement and to provide transportation for the product of these lands and the Government's (Inaudible) land.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.138" offset="2168477">As a result of the land grant, the Railroad Company and the Railway Company of the successor received approximately 39 and a half million acres of land.</text>
