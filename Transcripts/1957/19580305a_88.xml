            <text syncTime="5006.670" offset="20026619">Well, if it please the Court, I want to make two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="5010.224" offset="20040829">One is when we talk about habeas corpus itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="5014.826" offset="20059220">And in this particular case, we believe that the District Court Judge, the United States federal judge, was correct in denying this application for habeas corpus on the grounds that the remedies had not been exhausted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5038.156" offset="20152529">Now, if I understand correctly, Rule 22 (1) of this Court provides that you have 90 days from the final hearing in the State Supreme Court within which to file certiorari appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="5055.564" offset="20222224">In this particular case, the appeal was decided in Arizona on October 18, 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="5063.761" offset="20255033">A rehearing was denied on November 16th, 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="5070.350" offset="20281365">It is the State's contention that the 90 days commenced to run when that rehearing was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="5077.337" offset="20309264">However, it wasn't until October 24th, 1955, about 11 months later that certiorari was applied for for the first time in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5091.059" offset="20364225">In the meantime, it is true there had been an application for a new trial in the trial court on the grounds of newly discovered evidence that no point that was brought up in the trial was brought up in that particular application for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5111.488" offset="20445936">But it wasn't until after that matter had been applied for in the Superior Court and decided by the Supreme Court of Arizona and a rehearing denied that certiorari was for the first time applied for here.</text>
