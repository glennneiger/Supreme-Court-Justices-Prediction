            <label>Mr. John F. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="18.682" offset="74710">Mr. Chief Justice, the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.980" offset="103863">In the original wire-tapping cases, Olmstead and Nardone, this Court was dealing with wire-tapping in the sense of an actual interference with the electrical circuit, either by means of attaching wires to that circuit or by means of induction.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.925" offset="207621">The question, here, is whether the same rules apply when an extension telephone is used.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.491" offset="241894">Here, the petitioner made a call from New York City to a certain station in Pueblo, Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.425" offset="285675">The call was completed just as was intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.280" offset="305110">It was received in Pueblo on the regularly installed instruments at the station which was called.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.024" offset="344085">And it was at that station that at the request of one of the parties to the conversation, the two police officers listened to the conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.892" offset="391523">I think one thing is clear in this field of interception and that is, that the contents of a telephone message do not acquire a confidential status merely because the message is transmitted over the telephone.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.673" offset="486609">Either party to the conversation, for example, may disclose the contents of that conversation to a third party.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.598" offset="526315">And the holding of the Goldman case was that a third party could eavesdrop at the commencement of the conversation and as long as he didn't interfere with the actual means of transmission, he could disclose what he heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.862" offset="615445">It seems to me that it makes no sense to draw a distinction between the situation where, Mr. Sparks, in Colorado, can hold the telephone a few inches away from his ear so that someone can overhear what has been said and where he requests the officers to step into the next room and listen in on the regularly installed telephone instrument.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.725" offset="726831">But that is the question -- that is really the question which is before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.050" offset="752118">We urge that Congress was intending to protect the integrity of this particular means of communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.792" offset="807079">There is little or no legislative history relative to 605 which aids us in determining, specifically, what Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.539" offset="850129">But we do know that they legislated with the Olmstead case in the background.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.631" offset="874475">We know that there had been before they legislated the extensive use of wire-tapping in the sense of surreptitious attaching of wiretaps in connection with the enforcement of the Prohibition Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.361" offset="949394">The Congress had outlawed the use of funds for enforcing prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.692" offset="986697">So it's in this climate that Congress passed this Act which forbids the interception and divulgence of telephone messages.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.575" offset="1042286">And the specific question is, of course, is this an interception.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.754" offset="1078962">This Court has never passed on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.187" offset="1084709">The nearest the Court has come to passing on this particular question is the Goldman case which it -- its reasoning be applied here.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.768" offset="1118981">We think it shows that there was no interception here.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.164" offset="1132565">The lower -- the – the Courts of Appeals have had it before them on several occasions and they are split.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.083" offset="1156284">The Second Circuit, and not quite so clearly, but probably the Court of Appeals of the District Court of Columbia Circuit, have both held that this is an interception when a person listens on an extension phone with the consent of one of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.983" offset="1223889">The Sixth and the Seventh Circuit and some of the -- and some of the District Courts have held to the contrary and their view --</text>

            <label>Mr. John F. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="321.592" offset="1286269">They say that an interception is -- is in effect the eavesdropping on the -- on the conversation and that this is eavesdropping on the conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.190" offset="1332663">The Sixth Circuit, I think the reasoning and the plan of this case is -- is pretty clear which holds against the interception and they say that it is not an interception because the message begins at the place it was intended to begin perhaps and continues uninterruptedly to the place where it was supposed to be received and there someone listens and they say, "this is not an interception."</text>

            <text syncTime="367.747" offset="1470903">Our rational which -- rationale which we propose for the Court is that an interception was intended by Congress to be an interference with this method of communication and that there – there is in this case, no interference with the method of communication but rather the use of it as it was intended to be used.</text>
