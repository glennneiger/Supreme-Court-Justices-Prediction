            <text syncTime="55.735" offset="222877">They -- one of those denies a foreign corporation which makes a contract in Alabama the power to assert their rights under that contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="84.438" offset="337711">Those are the only statutes in Alabama which deal with what we would call the enforcement, that is the method of penalizing a corporation or its agents for coming in and doing business without a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.768" offset="399047">We do not place our action or base our action in any way on those.</text>

            <text syncTime="112.855" offset="451396">What I was thinking about Mr. Rinehart was whether it has a penalty for having -- having been delinquent in that query.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.911" offset="499566">There was any authority in anyone to say to that corporation that you cannot now qualify.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.714" offset="530808">I consider there will be many number of penalties that might attach to it but is there such a penalty as a denial of the right to register because of the delinquency in registering beforehand.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edmon L. Rinehart</label>
            <text syncTime="152.186" offset="608653">Not a penalty but we believe a power in the court of equity in its equity jurisdiction to police, perhaps police is not the correct word, to supervise corporations once it has jurisdiction of the subject matter in this case to maintain the status quo.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.428" offset="681691">We petitioned not only for temporary injunction but a permanent injunction and ultimately an order of ouster basing it on the power of the state to exclude a corporation completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.190" offset="748669">If we had not in the first place let it in, we don't -- we actually concede, if we let a corporation in, we allowed to qualify, we can't then turn around and say, “We're sorry, we just don't like you anymore.”</text>
            <text syncTime="199.010" offset="796003">Or we can't ask them to waive their constitutional rights in advance and coming in as a condition preceding to entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.726" offset="822857">But where they are interlopers as we consider this corporation to be doing business in Alabama without even the slightest action toward complying with our laws that they are interlopers and that they have absolutely no right to be here and that the equity power is the only effective way to protect and vindicate the constitutional provision which is involved here -- the constitution that is of Alabama, Section 232.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.239" offset="948872">And that the equity courts have that power.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.378" offset="965486">And if they have the power to oust, they have the lesser concluded power to restrain their qualified as a -- in fact, that's one of the reasons we think that the records to get to the merits of this case -- no I mean the merits before the Circuit Court is so important in this case to determine whether or not they should be ousted in a proceeding of equity in the nature of (Inaudible) such as Kansas did in State ex rel Griffith against Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.313" offset="1093172">That is the gravamen of the states petition, a sworn bill, I might add, a sworn bill in equity which was filed on June 1, 1956.</text>

            <text syncTime="627.164" offset="2508591">Said forms were attached to his answer and petitioner stated that it would file these forms if the court would dissolve its orders buying petition from registering and would permit petitioner to file the forms attached to his answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.053" offset="2568150">We submit it does not and for some very definite reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.668" offset="2594586">One, on reviewing the chronology of this case, you will see that petitioner didn't file any pleadings until 31 days after the temporary injunction of that, on the fifth of July which was three days after and I might add, that then the trial judge set down the hearing on a motion to dissolve a temporary injunction for the 16th of July.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.734" offset="2698867">The State then moved to produce -- rather moved for an order for them to produce, which motion was heard on the 9th of July which counsel for the petitioner was present.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.552" offset="2750171">The case was fully argued and presented on that question purely of the production and the order was granted on the 11th.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.762" offset="2791027">Then their time was extended.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.660" offset="2810567">Then the order said produce on the 16th which was the day before the hearing on the motion to dissolve the temporary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.004" offset="2847974">Now, Alabama procedure is that while oral testimony may not be introduced on such a hearing as a matter of right, you can put it in if it isn't objected to.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.662" offset="2890606">But in addition, the hearing can be on affidavits of both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.852" offset="2911399">We thought it's extremely important to have those records to sustain and (Inaudible) the allegations of the bill to prepare affidavits, to obtain affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.804" offset="2959151">Then the trial judge extended their time to produce.He correspondingly extended our time for the hearing because we needed those documents in connection with the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.211" offset="3000842">Now then, at the last hour or if not the 12th hour, at least the 11th hour, they come in with an answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.109" offset="3036369">Now, we're not interested in a corporation filing these papers if they don't have to file them.If they are exempt, they don't need to tender it.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.153" offset="3076598">Alabama isn't interested in a corporation not doing business in Alabama, filing these documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.664" offset="3098645">We are not trying to assert a right we don't have but we think we're entitled to a hearing on the merits as to whether or not they are doing business in Alabama because our ultimate aim in this, admittedly, I couldn't deny it on what we've alleged here, is that we think they are long-past record of ignoring our laws warranted something more than a slap on the wrist saying, “Well, now you can pay it and go and send no more.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1565.214" offset="6260820">In that case, petition for certiorari, what was considered was contempt of an order to deliver certain bonds and other documents to a receiver and equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.010" offset="6343993">The Court reiterated the traditional view that certiorari -- you look at the face of the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.846" offset="6375340">You see whether there was jurisdiction of the persons -- the parties I should say, jurisdiction of the subject matter, whether there was a contempt, whether all the procedural aspects of a contempt proceeding are followed, remembering that it is a completely ancillary proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.701" offset="6442736">Now, and they held that in fact since the face of the proceeding is so that in fact the he had obeyed the order and that there hadn't been any new order, even though a new receiver had been appointed, there was no contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.604" offset="6502400">They went on to say that if there was a question of a payment of a debt, the debt could be reviewed on petition for writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.497" offset="6549943">Now they didn't say -- they didn't do as the Morris case and in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.807" offset="6563213">They didn't say, “Well, now, we said all, we're got to say all we have to say.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.044" offset="6588082">They just went on and discussed this question of writ of habeas corpus that had he been imprisoned in this case to pay a debt which might well had been the case, why then he could have reviewed it for petition for writ of habeas corpus.</text>

            <text syncTime="4303.394" offset="17213544">But our position is, if the Court please, that at the very outset, the Alabama court, the Court in this instance took illegal action because the only action that we are aware of that Alabama could exert against the corporation for failure to register was the action which is the statutory penalties which are set out on our brief at page 35.</text>
            <text syncTime="4328.956" offset="17315736">So, we are faced at the very outset, we're being put out of business without a hearing and then being ordered as a condition of -- of having a hearing on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="4339.829" offset="17359308">Of that -- at that point, we are then required to either submit to what we consider unconstitutional conditions or in effect stay ousted and have a final judgment entered against us in effect because we cannot prosecute this claim until the contempt proceedings had been finally adjudicated.</text>
