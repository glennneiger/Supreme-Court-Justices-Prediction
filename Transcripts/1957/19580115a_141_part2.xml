          <heading>Argument of Victor Rabinowitz</heading>
          <turn speaker="victor_rabinowitz" startTime="0.000" stopTime="467.549">
            <label>Mr. Victor Rabinowitz</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">We have here -- briefly at this point, a situation in which a young man is inducted into the Army, not at his request, serves under fire for a year for which he receives service medals and an honorable separation, returns to civilian life and two years later is inflicted with a very grievous injury because he has alleged to have engaged in lawful political activity before his induction into the Army, before the regulation, which is applicable to him was passed on the basis of a regulation which, I submit, is unconstitutionally vague and all of this in an area involving very fundamental First Amendment freedom.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.137" offset="264464">The implications of this are extremely broad, it is in this record, but the fact is, that the Army claims the right, also, to give an undesirable discharge because of political activities engaged in by a man after his separation from the service during the six years of his service in the inactive reserves and there are such cases that are now administratively pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.909" offset="407615">This means that the United States Army, if this be a valid procedure, is given the right to censor the activities of substantially every young man in the United States up to about the age of 30.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.519" offset="490057">They have the right to investigate, look at those activities and if they are contrary to this regulation or any successive regulation, to punish him, to give him an undesirable discharge because those activities are activities of which the Army does not approve.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.503" offset="577933">And this is a most stringent form of censorship.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.303" offset="597159">I can't think of no agency of the United States government that is less qualified to carry on this function than the United States Army because, certainly, there is nothing in the training of the Army, nothing in the tradition of the Army, that gives it the right to determine whether certain political activities are to be approved or disapproved.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.991" offset="707918">To say that this raises serious constitutional questions is, I think, an understatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.409" offset="745535">Before we get to the constitutional issues involved, however, because I know that this Court would, as always, prefer not to have to pass on them, let us see what is the statutory authority for this extremely broad assertion of authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.248" offset="824947">Let me say preliminarily that although we have had an Army in this country since, I suppose, 1775 and the Articles of War, as Mr. MacGuineas has said, have been in existence since the Continental Congress passed them and although our Army has operated for almost two centuries now, all during this period of time, it has generally been regarded that a discharge is to be determined, it is a reflection, it is a judgment in the words of this court, a judgment on a man's military service, not on what he did before he got in to the Army or what he did after he was in the Army, but a judgment on his military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.041" offset="1028075">It is a final statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.938" offset="1035703">This man has served honorably.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.190" offset="1044689">This man has not served honorably.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.565" offset="1058168">Now we had a sharp break with that history.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.012" offset="1080007">We have an assertion by the Army of the broadest kind of power, of power to determine and to visit, as I said, extreme penalty on persons who do not live up to its standard of what is proper political conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.943" offset="1163703">Now if, as I say, the Army had statutory power to do this, we would have to face the constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.731" offset="1206857">But what is statutory power to do it?</text>
            <text syncTime="305.442" offset="1221695">All that we have in this case is two statutes phrased in the most general language and which appear at page two of petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.876" offset="1287419">One is the Act of May 5th, 1950 which says that any enlisted -- all enlisted persons who are discharged from the United States service -- military service of the United States shall get a discharge and that the Secretary of the Army shall prescribe the manner for such discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.781" offset="1383027">I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.190" offset="1384699">There are, perhaps, three sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.253" offset="1392953">The second one, Section 248 of the Armed Forces Reserve Act of 1952 which says that the discharge of members of the reserve shall be in accordance with regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.077" offset="1444258">And finally, the last section set forth at the bottom page 2 which says that if a man gets less than an honorable discharge and undesirable discharge, as in this case, it shall be pursuant to the approved finding of a board of officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.096" offset="1500369">Nothing in here that suggests that Congress intended to give to the Army a general political censorship that the Congress intended by these statutes to make that break with history and to give to the Army the power to exert this vast censorship over 30 years of a young man's life.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.525" offset="1598067">This is an extreme power indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.926" offset="1611651">Personally, I doubt whether Congress would have the constitutional power to give the United States Army that right, I don't believe Congress has the power to give anybody that right, but certainly in our system of government, not the United States Army.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.821" offset="1679256">But if Congress did intend to give Congress that right, it seems to me the -- that the least that could be required under these circumstances is for Congress to say so.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.690" offset="1726694">And for Congress to give to the Army the right to make political tests, to impose those political tests on a man's preinduction activity and not nearly repeat, which in substance, it has done here the language of statutes which in one form or another had been in effect in the United States since 1775 and in England, before that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.195" offset="1820735">This is a great and important power which the Army is here contending for.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.884" offset="1843513">If it has that right as a matter of statute, somewhere, there should be statute that says so.</text>

            <text syncTime="874.219" offset="3496856">And the purpose of that Act was to improve the efficiency of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.022" offset="3516082">And to that end, it prohibited the introduction of private bills on three subjects (1) Court claims, (2) Applications to build bridges over navigable streams, and (3) For the correction of military records.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.547" offset="3606152">Now significantly, with respect to tort claims, at the same Act, Congress established first, with respect the claims up to $1000, a system of administrative authority to settle claims but those claims as well as all claims over $1000 were given an explicit judicial remedy by a suit de novo in the district courts by contrast with respect to the other two types of subject matters to which private bills were prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.484" offset="3745855">The only remedy granted with respect to applications to build bridges is, that you must obtain the approval of the Secretary of War, in other words, Congress turned the whole subject matter of building bridges over to the Secretary of War.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.972" offset="3807817">And with respect to the correction of military records, Congress then established the boards for the correction of the military records and turned over to those boards the claims for the correction of military records.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.007" offset="3880020">Now, in -- in one instance, Congress creates a judicial remedy explicitly and in the other two instances, creates explicit administrative remedies with no provision for judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.141" offset="3932473">That seems to us, highly significant of the intention of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.660" offset="3950550">And furthermore, we think that our position is buttressed by the fact that prior to 1944, when the Army Discharge Review Boards, Service Discharge Review Boards were established.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.769" offset="4006975">The only remedy by which a soldier's discharge certificate could be changed, assuming that the Secretary himself was unwilling to do so, was by Private Act of Congress for generations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.176" offset="4072699">Congress had been passing private acts on application of this order to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.594" offset="4090358">So that also seems to us, to indicate, that Congress felt that the tribunal, the place to go for that was not to the courts but -- after exhaustion of your remedy before the department, to go to Congress itself, certainly, if it had been felt that the courts had jurisdiction to entertain such applications, Congress would not have troubled itself to pass these private bills granting that relief on a piecemeal basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="2181.632" offset="8726465">And we set forth on our brief, at the beginning of page 28, statements from the legislative history which shows explicitly that the bill originally contained a provision that a discharge, less than an honorable discharge could be given for security reasons without a hearing, if the interest of the government require.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.032" offset="8824059">And that furthermore, there was at one stage a provision in the bill to the effect that a discharge specifically could be discharged for security reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.106" offset="8872333">That specific statement was in the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.837" offset="8887275">So, there's no question that Congress was aware that this statute, the applicable one to petitioner in this case, would be used or might be used by the Secretary of the Army to discharge a man because he deemed him a security risk.</text>

            <text syncTime="2269.896" offset="9079536">Well, we will do that in the supplemental memorandum which we have indicated that we will submit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.774" offset="9099076">Now, if I may turn a moment to our other question of justiciability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.570" offset="9126243">What I say will specifically deal with Abramowitz but it applies a fortiori to Harmon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.392" offset="9157486">Abramowitz has the honorable separation from active service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.750" offset="9178906">That gives him all federal benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.552" offset="9198132">He is not deprived of any right to veteran's pensions or hospitalization or anything else that a veteran gets and of course, it's also true beyond question that Harmon gets all federal benefits by virtue of his general discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.925" offset="9263647">So, petitioners are driven back to resort to a denial, alleged denial of benefits under the New York statutes where they reside.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.722" offset="9302831">In the first place, they do not correctly cite the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.740" offset="9322893">No New York statute uses the words “honorable discharge.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.591" offset="9342328">It speaks of honorably discharge soldiers and I have and we're allowed with the Court, verbatim copies of an opinion of the Attorney General of New York, explicitly construing one of those statutes and saying that as long as the soldier does have a dishonorable discharge, he is entitled to the benefits of the New York veteran statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.049" offset="9444101">In other words, the opinion recognizes the distinction in terms between an honorable discharge and a general discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.762" offset="9479001">And the Attorney General of New York says, “It doesn't make any difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.285" offset="9493107">Whichever one he has is sufficient for purposes of New York benefits.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.306" offset="9513169">And -- so that even quite apart from the question as to whether there's any likelihood that these Petitioners would ever apply for those benefits or if so, that they would be denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.813" offset="9547233">And the fact is, we have an authoritative ruling by the New York authorities that they are eligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.406" offset="9569593">The only other question on which petitions rely for justiciability is the so-called question of stigma.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.851" offset="9599373">They equate a decision by determination that a soldier is a security risk with the comments made by this Court in Joint Anti-Fascist and Peters v.Hobby that a stigma attaches to a characterization of disloyalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.761" offset="9666978">We think that is stretching those cases beyond reason and all of those cases significantly, with one exception, that's Joint Anti-Fascist, every one of those cases depended for its justiciability not upon any question of stigma.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.979" offset="9735837">They were questions of employees who had actually been discharged, allegedly contrary to the law or statute and, of course, this Court has always said, there is District Court justiciability of that kind of case or some of them are even criminal content convictions like the Watkins case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.328" offset="9809293">Of course, there's no question of justiciablity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.901" offset="9819533">Now, the one case which is not fit in that mode is Joint Anti-Fascist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.280" offset="9837087">And there, justiciability was rested on the fact that what was on the pleadings necessarily construed by this court as an unauthorized and an arbitrary public designation by the Attorney General of an organization, as a communist organization, was defamatory and that that kind of defamation gave justiciablity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.026" offset="9940010">Now, in the first place, that counsel made some comments about this being -- this certificates being a public document.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.249" offset="9976895">They are not a public document.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.313" offset="9985149">The fact is, that under Army regulations, if a man writes to the Army and says, ”I want to hire John Jones,” what kind of a discharge certificate did he get or what kind of a report of separation?</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.258" offset="10028931">The Army will not give that information.</text>
