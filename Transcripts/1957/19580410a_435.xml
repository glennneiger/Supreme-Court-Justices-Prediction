            <label>Mr. John F. Langs</label>
            <text syncTime="19.217" offset="76800">Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.700" offset="90697">If it please the Court, I would like to, in the time alloted to me, to bring to your attention certain basic issues which I believe are fundamental to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.714" offset="166766">This case involves a question of federal control of Insurance versus state control of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.980" offset="211905">We are joined in this position that we present to the Court by 38 States who have joined in the amicus brief, of the State of Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.903" offset="255582">And there are two amicus briefs that have been filed representing 96% of the Legal Reserve Life Insurance companies of the country and 80% of the accident and health insurance business of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.793" offset="319112">The Federal Trade Commission assumes two positions which we believe are not proper in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.285" offset="365087">It first of all assumes that by innuendo, if not, by direct comment, that the insurance companies operate in this country without control or regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.099" offset="412317">They also apparently assume and I quote from page 29 of their brief which -- and they have used this as a pretext in our opinion for taking the position which they have that there has been widespread evidence that the phenomenal growth of the accident and health insurance business has been accompanied in many instances by false and misleading advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.613" offset="522449">On behalf of the respondent and of the insurance industry of our country, we object to this statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.105" offset="556408">There is no evidence of any kind in anyway, shape or form in this case or the National case or in the American Hospital case that there is any of this evidence which counsel referred to, namely thousands of letters which had been received.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.722" offset="622864">Not one of them or any testimony pertaining to that was introduced in our case, whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.498" offset="661943">There is no -- there is no complaint on the part of any state agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.814" offset="695171">There is no complaint on the part of any officer of any company that they had received any information pertaining to any matter that was deceitful or fraudulent.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.968" offset="755775">Insurance business is built on service, service to the widow, the orphan, the sick, the injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.293" offset="789107">It has paid billions of dollars in claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.026" offset="804049">It has been in business in this country since the inception of our country.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.006" offset="824007">No business can -- can succeed for long unless it renders service.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.605" offset="850338">Service has been provided by the insurance companies of this country for each score year and more and in the case of National Casualty Company for more than 50 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.170" offset="912614">I simply want to indicate at this time our objection to the use of a position which is not a part of this case, which counsel has referred to, so much for that portion.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.508" offset="966008">Now, I believe it is important that we understand a little more fully.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.557" offset="986175">Some of the justices yesterday, I was satisfied, were reaching for some of the material facts and historical background as it might apply to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.983" offset="1031837">This Court of course is very familiar with the McCarran Act, how it arrived, how it arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.494" offset="1057959">In the Southeastern case in 1944, this Court held that the transaction of insurance business constituted interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.322" offset="1105189">Prior to this case and from the inception of the -- our constitutional form of government -- government, all insurance business had been regulated, was regulated by the several States, each having a Department of Insurance, each having a budget, each having many personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.118" offset="1188467">Without question, I think that the State of New York has probably one of the largest, and probably one of the most substantial insurance departments of any state in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.174" offset="1272686">McCarran-Ferguson Act was adopted in 1945, a few months after the decision of this Court in the Southeastern Underwriter case.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.670" offset="1314586">There are three sections of this law which are very important, and the law we believe is very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.079" offset="1348232">Counsel for the Government in the several stages that we have gone through before the hearing, the hearing officer for the FTC, Circuit Court of Appeals, the brief here and before this Court has constantly shifted their position.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.666" offset="1418658">I can understand to some extent why that would be done, why they'll be necessary because when you run head-on into clear precise language, it takes a little maneuvering to try and get around it.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.425" offset="1469649">Section 1 of this McCarran Act provides this that the Congress hereby declares that the continued regulations by the several States of the business of insurance is in the public interest, very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.629" offset="1526491">They were stating that the regulation of insurance shall be continued, underlying the word continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.160" offset="1568601">And the continuous -- continuance of that can only mean and be the continuance of the law as it was applied by the several States.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.944" offset="1603709">Section 2 (a) of this law states this.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.711" offset="1618756">"The business of insurance and every person engaged therein shall be subject to the laws of the several States which relate to the regulation of such business.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.599" offset="1658358">The business of insurance and every person engaged therein shall be subject to the law of the several States.‚Äù</text>
            <text syncTime="424.234" offset="1696914">This does not indicate a type of enforcement and I will comment upon that later on, it says the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.321" offset="1725231">Section 2 (b) of this Act, which is the passed section which I will poke a portion of it, ‚ÄúNo Act of Congress shall be construed to invalidate, impair or supersede any law enacted by any State for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance, unless such Act specifically relates to the business of insurance.‚Äù</text>
            <text syncTime="455.724" offset="1822824">I don't know how Congress can be more explicit and more clearer than in those three sentences -- three Sections of the law to state that it shall be continued by the States, that it shall be subject to the laws of the States and that no act of Congress shall apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.917" offset="1887608">Then, they put on the proviso which was added in the conference hearing between the Senate and the House, provided, the Federal Trade Commission, and I'm using only the Federal Trade Commission or others mentioned, as amended shall be applicable to the business of insurance to the extent that such business is not regulated by state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.848" offset="1983321">I don't see how there can be any question of what Congress -- what Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.924" offset="2003696">Congress knew, this Court knows and -- and so mentioned in the Prudential-Benjamin case that there are many States and each State would have different ideas about what they would want in the way of regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.957" offset="2059807">Congress knew that.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.168" offset="2068584">Section 3 (a), provided for a moratorium.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.472" offset="2081855">The moratorium simply states that this Act shall not apply until after the moratorium period has expired and then only if the States do not have law.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.359" offset="2133368">Now, in the congressional debates that adopted this law, I would like to call attention to three statements and three only.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.791" offset="2179135">And I refer to the brief of -- of the Life Insurance Association of America, the amicus brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.026" offset="2208078">They have it set out fully on page 29, the bottom of page 29 and the top of page 30 and a portion of it and a statement on 31.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.600" offset="2266384">And I call the Court's attention to this particular situation as it existed at the time the debate occurred in the United States Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.142" offset="2308493">Senator McCarran and Senator Ferguson had indicated very clearly what the law meant and Senator Pepper, I was not satisfied with the statements that it might mean that the law -- the States could adopt laws which the Federal Government or the Federal Trade Commission might believe were not sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.865" offset="2407445">Senator Pepper states this.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.101" offset="2416327">I'm referring to and a directing a question to Senator McCarran.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.536" offset="2434090">‚ÄúDoes that mean that after January 1, 1948, the States may determine whether or not the Sherman and the other Acts become applicable to the business of insurance?‚Äù</text>
            <text syncTime="618.370" offset="2473378">Senator McCarran, ‚ÄúThe answer to that question is yes.‚Äù</text>
            <text syncTime="623.923" offset="2495634">Senator Pepper, ‚ÄúApparently, the conference report goes further than I had understood it to go.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.023" offset="2520085">It does not stop with a moratorium at the end of three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.294" offset="2537117">At the end of three years, the moratorium would continue if in the meantime a State had regulated the business to any extent, whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.278" offset="2569091">That would defeat the Supreme Court decision.‚Äù</text>
            <text syncTime="645.403" offset="2581525">Senator McCarran, ‚ÄúThe -- the moratorium would not be continued, but if in the meantime, the States themselves had regulated a business of insurance, the Sherman and Clayton Acts and the other Acts would not become effective.‚Äù</text>
            <text syncTime="660.875" offset="2643487">One short statement by Senator Ferguson, who of course was one of the sponsors of the Bill, on page 31 of this brief, Senator Ferguson makes this statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.533" offset="2686119">‚ÄúAfter the moratorium has expired, if a State has not legislated on the subjects covered by three Acts,‚Äù and underline the word ‚Äúlegislative‚Äù, ‚Äúto which reference has been made, those Acts shall be act applicable to the business of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.517" offset="2742021">But insofar as the State is concerned which has specifically legislated upon the subject, the three Acts shall not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.038" offset="2784131">And then Senator Barkley, summing up all of this argument on the last day before this bill was adopted, and this bill came up for decision and then was put over for consideration for one day.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.971" offset="2831882">And on page 36, we find his statement that Senator Barkley made and suffice it to state in his very long statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.106" offset="2872424">But he stated there that Congress still retain the right to consider this matter at a later date if they found that the States were not doing that which Congress felt they should do.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.017" offset="2931984">That is some 12 years -- 11 to 12 years ago and there has been no Act in Congress since that time to amend or change that law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2098.265" offset="8393038">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.446" offset="8417698">In spite of the fact that the only question before this Court is a question of jurisdiction of counsel for petitioner on yesterday entered into the merits of the case, which seem to me were the obvious purpose of attempting to convince this Court that my client was a bad actor and that my client had progressed through misrepresentation and control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.487" offset="8545907">Before getting into the question before this Court therefore, it seems to me that I would be justified in very briefly replying to that position taken by counsel for the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.516" offset="8605989">When the hearing was had in our case, every State in which my client did business, except the State of Mississippi had enacted regulatory law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.914" offset="8667638">It had not been enacted in the State of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.496" offset="8681953">After an extensive hearing, the hearing examiner held that in all States except Mississippi, the Federal Trade Commission had no jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.197" offset="8740780">But as the law had not been enacted, in the State of Mississippi, it had jurisdiction in that State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.087" offset="8772336">And he then went very extensively into the charges in the complaint, and I wish to address myself very briefly to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.195" offset="8828761">I'll just take one instance in the complaint with which he dealt and I'll say that the hearing examiner exonerated my client completely and held that it had not been guilty of any false, fraudulent or deceptive practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.302" offset="8897202">Just one instance of the complaint, one item the complaint was based on the charge that in our advertising, we had the statement, ‚Äúcovers accidents‚Äù.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.974" offset="8967837">The hearing examiner in his -- his initial decision and all of these are in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.411" offset="8993541">The hearing examiner pointed out the fact that in that complaint and they -- the Federal Trade Commission took the position that that was a representation, that all accidents were covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.128" offset="9052473">The hearing examiner pointed out the fact that the Federal Trade Commission in filing the complaint had stopped at a comma in a sentence and that the statement in the advertising was ‚ÄúCovers accident, subject to policy terms.‚Äù</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.192" offset="9128751">And in the same advertising, there was the statement in 12-point boldface type.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.936" offset="9163651">‚ÄúBenefits are subjects to the terms of the policy issues.‚Äù</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.115" offset="9188415">The hearing examiner under the undisputed evidence stated that these brochures were sent only to agents and became a part of the agent sale kit and were only used in personal interviews with prospects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.118" offset="9280470">And he took the position that in that personal interview, that when the advertising stated, covered -- covers accidents subject to policy terms that the prospect would naturally think of two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.643" offset="9358524">One was that accident insurance always had some exceptions and the other was, when the flag was raised, subject to policy terms that the prospect would inquire as to what were the exceptions in what accidents were not covered.</text>

            <text syncTime="2460.772" offset="9843043">The allegations of the complaint charging the respondent with making false and misleading statements and representations with respect to the terms and conditions of its policies in general or with respect to the terms and conditions of specific policies have not been established by a substantial, reliable probative evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.694" offset="9934681">Accordingly, it cannot be found that the respondent has violated the Federal Trade Commission Act by engaging in unfair and deceptive acts and practices in commerce to the prejudice and injury of the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.495" offset="9989956">Therefore, it is ordered that the complaint herein be in the same, is hereby dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.374" offset="10017437">On appeal, the -- the Federal Trade Commission held that the charges in the complaint had been established and issued a cease and desist order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.896" offset="10075533">Now -- proceeding now to the merits of the case, counsel for petitioner refers to these enactments by the States, as little Trade Commission Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.735" offset="10162887">Now, of course, living why -- where I do, it's -- would be a little difficult for me to admit that anything relative to Texas was little.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.457" offset="10197786">But without being at all facetious, I wish to submit to the Court that all of these Acts are solemn enactments by the State legislators and that they are entitled to the same dignity as the Federal Trade Commission Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.404" offset="10301544">Counsel takes the position that these Acts are permissive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.984" offset="10319935">And therefore, the Insurance Commissioners can enforce them or refrain from enforcing them just as he desires.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.311" offset="10357238">All of these Insurance Commissioners are officers of the State under oath to enforce the laws that are in their charge.</text>

            <text syncTime="3306.654" offset="13226527">This bill extends the so-called moratorium provision of Public Law of 15 of the 79th legislature, from January 1, 1948 until June 30th, 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.252" offset="13276996">The Committee is informed and is satisfied that an effort has been exerted by the insurance industry, the Insurance Commissioners and the States in dealing with the matter of state regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.132" offset="13324434">However, the Committee recognizes that the problems have not been solved and is all the opinion that an extension of the so-called moratorium should be granted in order to provide the Congress an additional time to examine into the situation more completely than it has been able to do during the present session.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.293" offset="13405100">As the Committee is of the opinion that considerable studies should be given to this matter and the question of the need, if any, of further federal legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.225" offset="13456823">It would appear most desirable to extend this moratorium period an additional six months, therefore, giving -- thereby, giving the Congress a reasonable time to examine the developments have -- that have taken place in this field during and immediately subsequent to the meetings of the 1947 legislatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.258" offset="13545012">Now then, the 1947 legislatures could only enact regulatory laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.382" offset="13573433">Now, I point out that nearly 10 years has passed since that report was made and that apparently, the state regulation is satisfactory to the Congress because they have not found the need of any additional federal legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.772" offset="13651069">Of course, we know at anytime, and we take the position that this proposition of adequacy of enforcement is not in the province of the Federal Trade Commission but it is in the province of the Congress of the United States at anytime that the Congress of the United States is dissatisfied with the way the state laws are being enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.443" offset="13749708">They can set up adequate federal laws and set up adequate federal legislation and take over this entire proposition of the regulation of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.840" offset="13795265">Of course, this proposition of advertising is a very small segment of this regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.358" offset="13821388">And we submit that it is apparent that the present situation over a period of 10 years since the Committee said they would engage in that study has been satisfactory to the Congress of the United States, which is the body to pass on whether this job is being done or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.356" offset="13917414">Now, in our case, we do no mail-order business, we do no magazine or newspaper advertising, we do no radio or television advertising, we do no direct mail advertising of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.459" offset="13997767">These brochures are merely sent to our agents in their sealed kit to be presented in face-to-face interviews with the prospects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.933" offset="14059729">If they disseminate any advertising, which is objectionable in every State where we do business, cease and desist orders may be issued against us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.523" offset="14130051">Heavy fines maybe imposed upon us because the law provides for heavy fines and the license, both of the company and of every agent, may be rescinded by the state authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.250" offset="14184908">We therefore submit, that in our case, there is no extent to which our business in not regulated by state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.137" offset="14228480">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3562.509" offset="14250005">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.533" offset="14270067">Mr. Lang, in dealing with the legislative history, referred the Court to a passage taken from Senator McCarran's comments when he was dealing specifically with the 2 (b) proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.695" offset="14350733">And he quoted that passage from page 30 of the brief for the Life Insurance Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.352" offset="14389394">And he read a question which began on 29 from Senator Pepper, "Does that mean after January 1, 1948, the States may determine whether or not the Sherman and the other Acts become applicable?"</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.202" offset="14452715">And he also read the first sentence of the reply, namely, the answer to that question is yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.513" offset="14486047">From that, he draws the inference that notwithstanding the use of the word ‚Äúregulated‚Äù in the proviso, the Court should treat the language of the proviso as if Congress has -- had said if the States enact a law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.120" offset="14552398">However, I suggest one should also read the second sentence of Senator McCarran's reply to that question, and that reads.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.651" offset="14590537">‚ÄúDuring the three-year moratorium, the States may if they see fit to do so, enact legislation for the purpose of regulation.‚Äù</text>
            <text syncTime="3659.415" offset="14637558">And then he says, I think making the thought still more clear, ‚ÄúIf they do enact such legislation to the extent that they regulate, they will have taken the business of insurance out from under the Federal Acts.‚Äù</text>
            <text syncTime="3673.762" offset="14695027">Now, I find it difficult to read that passage to support the conclusion that legislation in the form of a general enabling statute is equivalent to regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3687.257" offset="14748944">I think it leads to an opposite inference.</text>

            <text syncTime="3755.093" offset="15020304">Now, of course, that's no substitute for the Federal Trade Commission Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3758.440" offset="15033678">That's a criminal statute and it involves fraud, much advertising maybe misleading or deceptive and not involve fraud, do not involve the kind of intent that one would have to prove in a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3771.858" offset="15087386">Moreover, in a criminal case, we have the burden of ruling beyond a reasonable doubt and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3780.249" offset="15120927">We feel that the Federal Trade Commission Act is needed because it's a prophylactic act and the criminal statutes furnish no substitute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3788.994" offset="15155931">Now, the mail-order problem is not involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3794.625" offset="15178397">The Court, I think properly may have some concern with that because of its close relationship and it is in our view, a serious question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3806.022" offset="15224059">And the problem arises, I think typically, where an insurance company incorporates in a single State, say the State in Nebraska.</text>
            <text syncTime="3815.339" offset="15261257">It doesn't get a license in any other State but it sends out its advertising materials by mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3824.098" offset="15296366">And those who decide, they wish to buy a policy, fill out a form and send it back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3830.874" offset="15323429">It would seem to me that the other 47 States are probably powerless to deal with that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3840.282" offset="15361045">I don't see how there could be any enforcement if the State -- if the other States did enter a cease and desist order against sending the mails into the States how they could possibly enforce it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3853.134" offset="15412454">And indeed, in the Travelers Health case, the Court had its doubts about the problem of enforcement, at least where it extended beyond the question of service of process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3866.576" offset="15466266">And Justice Douglas's concurring opinion observed that in the case of a truly mail-order operation, the States are utterly helpless.</text>

            <text syncTime="3920.773" offset="15683082">That is very emphatically brought out in passages which are at pages 1661 of our brief from Senators Ferguson and O'Malley.</text>
            <text syncTime="3930.951" offset="15723729">Our further question, it seems to me, is whether there is no regulation -- excuse me.Whether there is no federal jurisdiction, where the States could concededly regulate under statutes already on the books of the States, but have failed to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3951.210" offset="15804813">Now, a word about this matter of failure to regulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3954.568" offset="15818188">We have a brief by the State of Michigan signed by 25 other States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3959.878" offset="15839504">I'm not going to deal with the points that that brief makes because I think that the entire brief misconceives the extent of the jurisdiction which we are claiming and that the opposition is based upon a misconception.</text>
            <text syncTime="3973.668" offset="15894570">But what does that briefs state, as to what the States are or are not doing by way of regulation?</text>
            <text syncTime="3981.424" offset="15925603">Here is a brief signed by the Attorney Generals of 26 States, which does not cite a single specific ruling or determination as to the advertising practices of a single insurer, which does not refer to the institution of a single cease and desist proceeding and is unable to refer to a single case, having arisen in the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4008.423" offset="16033646">I don't want to leave the impression that we are in opposition to the States.</text>
