            <text syncTime="9.860" offset="142817">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.731" offset="162252">This is the reargument of a criminal case that was argued here last November.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.119" offset="187852">It involves issues of double jeopardy and federal state relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.895" offset="210944">I represent the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.384" offset="220871">He's a prisoner in the Illinois penitentiary where he's now served four years of a life sentence for bank robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.287" offset="256502">This Court granted his petition for certiorari from the Illinois Supreme Court's affirmance of his conviction and appointed counsel for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.720" offset="302268">Our principal contention is that the State of Illinois has not accorded petitioner due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.929" offset="347094">Due process was disregarded, we submit, in more than one way, in several quite different ways, each one of which justifies reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.953" offset="395160">The procedural facts surrounding this trial are not creditable to American justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.442" offset="425148">The two most critical issues are, first, that Illinois tried him over again after he'd been acquitted by a federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.903" offset="462973">And second, which is entirely separate and independent ground is that Illinois convicted him on the basis of the unconstitutional activities of federal officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.140" offset="507904">Here are the facts, and they are not disputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.384" offset="528906">In 1953, a savings and loan association of Cook County was robbed by two armed men.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.368" offset="560880">They took about $4000 and escaped in a car.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.640" offset="581883">The driver was waiting in the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.549" offset="597556">Petitioner was then 26 years old, heard that he was wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.164" offset="616051">And he went to the United States Marshals Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.671" offset="630053">And there, he was arrested and charged for being the driver of the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.201" offset="652204">And his defense was they have the wrong man.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.730" offset="670281">At the trial, the identity of the driver of the car was the only issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.629" offset="693896">Petitioner took the stand, and he and other witnesses testified he was far away from the place at the time the robbery occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.672" offset="722108">And the testimony against him was by alleged accomplices.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.197" offset="740185">This trial was in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois and for violation of the federal bank robbery statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.615" offset="773831">And the basis of federal jurisdiction was, of course, that the institution which had been robbed was insured for the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.573" offset="817716">As a matter of fact, 94% of all savings and loan institutions in this country are federally insured.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.157" offset="844048">And the existence of this insurance was stipulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.038" offset="859512">Petitioner was found not guilty by the federal jury and was acquitted as a final end of that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.013" offset="895457">Now, we come to the activities of the federal officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.839" offset="910712">In spite of petitioner's acquittal by the federal court, the Federal Government kept on working for his conviction.</text>

            <text syncTime="241.989" offset="1071313">The -- the record of the federal trial was never introduced into evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.618" offset="1089808">But there was no dispute about it at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.199" offset="1100152">It was the -- the facts were all set out in the opinion of the Supreme Court of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.164" offset="1124080">It was assumed what transpired at the federal trial, the same evidence roughly was -- was presented and it was the same thing over again.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.299" offset="1156577">Now, the State's Attorney of Cook County said on the record that the federal authorities came to him after petitioner's federal acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.202" offset="1200149">Petitioner was then turned over immediately to state custody and he was indicted the second time for this same robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.920" offset="1227003">Now, the FBI agents in this regard, as we contend, of the double-jeopardy provision of the Fifth Amendment, interviewed one of petitioner's alibi witnesses and turned over the information to the state authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.268" offset="1284472">They kept on working up the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.195" offset="1296175">A special agent and the United States Attorney also interviewed an entirely new witness, a man who had not testified in the previous case.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.089" offset="1331702">And they were the ones that asked this new witness to come into the state court and testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.133" offset="1351868">And the federal agent did the interviewing.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.088" offset="1359705">So after the -- after the federal acquittal, final federal acquittal, the Illinois prosecutor didn't talk with this new witness until the day he examined him at the state trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.767" offset="1410487">As I said, this activity is an independent ground of reversal separate from the former acquittal point.</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="332.579" offset="1433684">You make no point in this argument, Mr. Fisher, of the statements of the trial judge in the federal court following the acquittal?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="walter_t_fisher" startTime="344.471" stopTime="847.771">
            <label>Mr. Walter T. Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="344.471" offset="1481226">The statements, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.726" offset="1490317">In the record -- the record as submitted to this Court is transmitted from the Supreme Court of Illinois does not contain the statements of -- of the trial judge -- the federal trial judge in -- in making statements that encouraged this prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.932" offset="1559071">We -- we added to our brief newspaper clippings and a clipping from the federal reporter.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.267" offset="1596479">In another case, entirely different case, and this was discussed in the federal reporter in order to justify this Court taking judicial notice of -- of the wide notoriety that the federal judge's action had here.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.197" offset="1660113">The wide notoriety was given this action in encouraging the second trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.673" offset="1678085">This is additional.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.420" offset="1685086">We think that the facts in the record that I've already given fully support our contention about the activities of the federal officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.139" offset="1719881">This interviewing of the witnesses are all in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.443" offset="1733151">But this part about what the federal Judge did is not in the record but it's described and I say the way that we -- it was and we submit that if this Court cares to take judicial notice of it as additional explanation of how this man happened to be gone after in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.890" offset="1818937">Now, our point is, of course, that the federal officers utilized the state court as their instrument in doing what the Federal Government has forbidden to do by the double-jeopardy provision of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.834" offset="1858748">And that, we submit, is not due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.947" offset="1875153">And we're not arguing that the Fifth Amendment is taking over in toto by the Fourteenth at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.882" offset="1918934">Now, the issue in this second state trial was the same as that in the first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.129" offset="1935862">And that issue was the identity of the person driving the car used in the escape.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.294" offset="1956551">And petitioner was found guilty in the second case, as the one in the Illinois State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.286" offset="1980479">Now, the reason why he got life imprisonment for this was because it was automatically mandatory under the Illinois second offender statute which was then enforced in Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.742" offset="2026350">And that statute provided, as the statutes do in a number of States, Your Honors no doubt know, that a prior conviction in a different case be mentioned in the indictment and brought to attention of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.272" offset="2076505">If you want to use -- if you want to use the second offender statute, you've got to put it in the -- in the indictment and put it to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.208" offset="2108165">Now, that feature of the statute has, I am very glad to say, been repealed since my client's conviction and Illinois is no longer in the position where juries have got to be told about previous offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.207" offset="2160201">But the repeal is not retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.225" offset="2172322">And in our brief, we raised that an independent ground of reversal what we regard as an extremely unfair application of that statute to this case and I won't argue it orally but it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.230" offset="2220283">The petitioner wasn't even allowed to introduce evidence of his own acquittal in rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.950" offset="2255182">I want to argue today will only be the time, three grounds of reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.430" offset="2273050">The first, the petitioner was tried over again after being acquitted, and second, the unconstitutional participation of the federal officers, and third, encroachment by the State of Illinois on the judicial power of the United States in holding at naught an -- an acquittal by a federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.867" offset="2354866">Now, our first point, it's undisputed that the only difference between the second trial and the first trial was the jurisdictional difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.527" offset="2389452">By which I mean the first trial was in a federal court, the second trial in a state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.892" offset="2410977">Now, this difference in sovereignties has sometimes been thought to permit double prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.629" offset="2441906">But that is, as I proposed to show, an open question for this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.416" offset="2464998">We contend that from the standpoint of due process that that difference in sovereignties is not of a nature to justify a second trial for what was in fact the same offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.509" offset="2525393">In short, the due process is a matter of substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.132" offset="2547858">Now, our whole case is based in this angle of this point on the premise that under the Fourteenth Amendment, the State of Illinois may not by itself keep on prosecuting a man after he's been acquitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.850" offset="2594774">I mean over and over again under the same statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.759" offset="2606373">Now, of course, it's well established, the Federal Government cannot do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.429" offset="2625076">It can't do it by itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.711" offset="2630196">You can't have successive federal prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.284" offset="2648482">But the Fifth Amendment provisions are, of course, binding only on the Federal Government, except, except that they may be so essential to ordered liberty as to be part of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.405" offset="2696965">We contend that the inviability of a former acquittal is so fundamental as to be part of due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.774" offset="2734477">You see, our position in this case is based on the defense of former acquittal, goes way back to the beginning of the common law and not on the concept of double-jeopardy as a whole which includes a good many other things that are not binding on the States and have been so held not to be binding by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.868" offset="2814830">There's an analogy of this that Justice Cardozo made in Palko case in the field of self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.262" offset="2848371">The privilege against self-incrimination is not binding on the States under the Fourteenth Amendment, not all of it, not the whole privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.313" offset="2888600">Yet, self-incrimination by forced confession is a violation of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.440" offset="2925171">That's just an analogy.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.232" offset="2932276">Now, in Hoag -- in Hoag against New Jersey, which was decided last May, this Court indicated that there are situations, not that case, there are situations of fundamental unfairness where consecutive trials by a State would be a denial of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.887" offset="3030915">Now, it is hard to imagine a situation of greater unfairness than where a man is tried over again after a judicial proceeding has finally terminated and a jury verdict then with a final judgment for the Court that he was innocent.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.550" offset="3105520">It's hard to imagine anything more destructive of ordered liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.189" offset="3136136">It would be destructive of judicial order.</text>

            <text syncTime="1996.374" offset="8088848">Last -- last session of this Court was a case that upheld the Assimilative Crimes Act which automatically brought into -- under a federal jurisdiction of state -- of state crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.685" offset="8158124">Now, suppose you have a -- an enclave, an Indian reservation say which is the one in that early Oregon that -- that's mentioned in some of our briefs where there is concurrent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.859" offset="8210787">Now, there, a state crime automatically becomes a federal crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.208" offset="8236178">Now, I submit that it would be shocking to permit successive prosecutions permit the Federal Government and the State Government to carrying off and have successive prosecutions on the theory that one offense was against the peace and dignity of the United States and the other was an entirely separate offense against the peace and dignity of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.916" offset="8307022">That's reducing due process to empty conceptualism, to verbalism, to formalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.551" offset="8349550">And if duplicate prosecution were attempted under a pair of statutes like that, this Court would be faced, but this isn't our case for determining the constitutional substance of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.451" offset="8393226">Whether the difference between the two statutes has constitutional significance so as to permit successive trials or whether they ought to come under the regular constitutional protection which goes back to the -- to the origins of our law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.964" offset="8463235">Another -- another example, I'll mention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.141" offset="8475982">In the early -- in the earlier years of the Republic, the -- the Federal Government relied on the state courts to -- to enforce federal law, to enforce federal rights by passing state statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.956" offset="8539199">And there's a statute still on the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.972" offset="8547244">The federal statute that allows the postal laws to this -- be enforced by the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.780" offset="8570441">Now, suppose that -- now, suppose that Illinois passes a statute making it a crime to forge postage stamps.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.848" offset="8614745">Now, I submit it would be shocking to say that a man could thereby for the same act for forging a postage stamp be subjected to successive prosecutions on the two sovereignties theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.121" offset="8655809">That one was against the piece of dignity of United States and the other was an entirely separate offense against the peace and dignity of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.600" offset="8729788">What -- if there's a difference in the gist or gravamen of the statute, then -- then it's all right to have -- have duplicate prosecutions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2186.452" offset="8849220">The Gauthier case was a case where the statues had different -- had different purposes for the same act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.561" offset="8885582">Gauthier case is well known for the justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.650" offset="8933961">Now, another case where the -- where the cases are not in point are the punishment cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.227" offset="9004283">And this was really a -- a digression to point out the two -- that the decision of two offenses of the same offense for purposes of preventing successive trials is an entirely different question whereby the same offense for purposes of double and multiple punishment by the same jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.164" offset="9076067">There isn't any such thing as tempting, if there were, but there isn't any such thing as a unit of the offense or unit of prosecution for all purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.416" offset="9120998">Now, this is brought out very well in the Gore case which this Court decided on June 30 of last where a single sale of narcotics was held to be the following three offenses for purposes of cumulating punishment, upheld the punishment, first, making the sale not in pursuance of a written order, two, not in the original stamp package, and three, facilitating the concealment and sale of narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.787" offset="9230503">Now, we don't quarrel such multiple punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.354" offset="9244818">But suppose the defendant in Gore had been tried and acquitted of one of those offenses, could the others be used as the basis of trying and over again for the same sale?</text>

            <text syncTime="2865.101" offset="11563760">Now, as I mentioned a minute ago, that it's the principal argument made against us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.709" offset="11598242">The heart of the argument made against us is that unless the State is allowed to relitigate federal criminal judgments, the Federal Government would equally be prevented from relitigating state judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.632" offset="11653935">And that would be a limitation on the federal judicial power and on federal supremacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.998" offset="11675355">And I agree that the rule out will work both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.323" offset="11688626">The States -- whatever the States can -- can or cannot do over again, the Federal Government are equally not to be able to do over again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.691" offset="11734183">Now, let's suppose that state prosecutions have shown themselves to be ineffective in some area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.137" offset="11763963">Suppose they all too often result in acquittals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.789" offset="11778487">There's no need to try the acquitted man over again to preserve federal supremacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.785" offset="11822477">The regular normal constitutional method has been alluded to by Mr. Justice Frankfurter and that is that Congress can preempt the field of postal crime in the case of the post office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.132" offset="11871901">Congress, all Congress has to do is to take from the State the power to act in that particular situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.816" offset="11894680">Now, in the field of bank robbery where cooperation between federal and state authorities is notoriously gross, it's almost inconceivable that preemption would ever become necessary but the (Inaudible) of certain views where Congress might sometime find it necessary to preempt in order to protect the federal supremacy from the effect of a prior state acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.156" offset="12000005">The Congress need not take over an entire field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.502" offset="12013380">It could make a partial preemption of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.109" offset="12023829">It's been so held -- held to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.524" offset="12037517">For example, this is as if a protection -- it's a possibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.527" offset="12053504">Congress might provide that a State could not begin a trial in a certain field until, say, 30 days after notifying the United States Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.300" offset="12084537">So that the United States Attorney would have the opportunity to proceed first.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.122" offset="12103868">But that's only how you would do it with the help of the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.373" offset="12120900">But the resources of federal preemption are ample and manifold.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.142" offset="12143992">And preemption is the decent, effective and regular constitutional method of protecting federal jurisdiction and making sure if you don't raise to the courts, because this only occurs in a -- in an area of concurrent jurisdiction where -- where Congress can -- can preempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.919" offset="12203029">You can't have double prosecutions unless -- unless there was concurrent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.320" offset="12232704">And federal supremacy does not require trying if -- an acquitted man over again.</text>

            <text syncTime="3081.364" offset="12428831">Now, the reason why a result -- this trying -- retrial could be defended and while Lanza could be defended in that particular case was that under the Eighteenth Amendment, preemption was not available as it is in all the other fields of concurrent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.198" offset="12512214">Congress could not take over the field of liquor regulation because the Court held in the Lanza case, the Congress could not protect federal supremacy by taking over the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.167" offset="12555995">And I quote from the Lanza opinion, “The -- the Eighteenth Amendment "put an end to restrictions upon the State's power arising out of the Federal Constitution.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.275" offset="12604479">Special language of the Eighteenth Amendment which is the only time the word “concurrent” was ever used in the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.500" offset="12629347">They found that for their federal preemption in the field of liquor regulation in whole or in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.864" offset="12654843">So however unfair double prosecutions may have been, a State's immunity from preemption in the liquor field supported the Court in that case in finding that they really were necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.111" offset="12715865">But the power of the Federal Government under the Eighteenth Amendment would have been sterilized because of that amendment by -- by state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.675" offset="12762049">They held in that case in Chief Justice Taft's opinion, that the field could not be preempted and the Court really found in effect that its result in Lanza was required by the Eighteenth Amendment and the Eighteenth Amendment has been repealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.135" offset="12831953">The alleged authority of Lanza simply does not exist and this Court is free to act and this Court has never violated the sanctity of a former acquittal.</text>

            <text syncTime="3217.165" offset="12972074">And the courts had all known separate jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.358" offset="12980851">And those expressions were taken to mean -- were taken to mean what they -- what Lanza prevented -- Lanza permitted successive prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.868" offset="13022856">This Court has never decided that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.272" offset="13036440">In Lanza, the early authorities were never discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.156" offset="13052008">In 1678, that was settled in the leading case of Rex against Hutchinson referred to on our brief on page 40.</text>

            <text syncTime="3342.179" offset="13472057">If the double-jeopardy provision of a Fifth Amendment means anything, it must mean that a man who's once been acquitted finally by a federal court ends the matter and the Federal Government and all its officers must stop trying to prove him guilty.</text>

            <text syncTime="3380.148" offset="13623986">And neither federal nor state officers should be permitted to evade these violations of due process by working through the other jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.212" offset="13664214">And that is the implication of what the Court said last June 30th in Knapp against Schweitzer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.314" offset="13688665">The Court found there was no evidence in that case that the State was used as an instrument of federal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.136" offset="13719907">But the Court said, “If a federal officer should be a party for the compulsion of testimony by state agencies, the protection of the Fifth Amendment would come into play.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.788" offset="13766510">Now, Knapp against Schweitzer was a state case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.844" offset="13778735">So the way it would come into play would be as a violation of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3948.896" offset="15898937">We say that that is not the case, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3952.973" offset="15915238">I should like to say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3959.313" offset="15940629">We begin -- I have in mind the -- and I'm not through with the discussion of the right of federal prosecuting officials to testify against and assist the State in the prosecution of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3976.520" offset="16009488">But I shall return to it after I have laid what I conceive to be the constitutional ground work for our position on the second question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3992.290" offset="16072495">We say in the first place such utterances as this Court has about to say upon the proposition, all of them vindicate the right of a State to prosecute for the same state of facts that the Federal Government may prosecute for and permit the Federal Government to prosecute upon the same state of facts that the State can prosecute for.</text>
            <text syncTime="4033.224" offset="16236231">There is no case exactly like this one and that is no United States Supreme Court case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4040.563" offset="16265592">But I would like to begin by knowing that this Court held before I get to the dual sovereignty case, this Court held in Palko against Connecticut that the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States does not inexorably prevent retrial even by the same sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="4081.541" offset="16429537">In the Palko case, Palko was acquitted in a state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4091.592" offset="16469765">That State, unlike most States, permitted the State to have an appeal and to obtain a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4103.377" offset="16516890">The State did appeal and Connecticut's higher courts ordered a new trial for Palko.</text>
            <text syncTime="4118.111" offset="16575822">On that second trial, he was convicted and sentenced to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="4123.328" offset="16596720">And this Court held that so long as there was not a mere prosecution, repeated trials as long as there was some reason for retrial, retrial did not deny due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment even though a similar retrial would have constituted double-jeopardy under the Fifth Amendment if the retrial had occurred in a federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4160.386" offset="16744887">So we cannot begin our consideration of this case with any assumption that double-jeopardy per se denies due process and then simply argue about what constitutes double-jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4176.849" offset="16810820">The initial premise that double-jeopardy per se denies due process is not sound unless Palko against Connecticut is to be overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="4187.680" offset="16854079">Now, in over 100 years ago, in the Fox case, this Court declared that both the State and the Federal Government may prosecute the utterance of false coins, the passing of counterfeit moneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="4222.938" offset="16995140">And it used language, I don't wish to read at length from the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4228.979" offset="17019277">But I should like to say that in the later case, still over 100 years old of Moore against Illinois where the -- this Court upheld dual prosecution of the interference of the relation between a master and a slave.</text>
            <text syncTime="4250.537" offset="17105481">This Court then said, if I may, Mr. Chief Justice, to quote just a few words that I think are pertinent, “Every citizen of the United States is also a citizen of a State or territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="4265.887" offset="17166921">He may be said to all legions to two sovereigns and may be liable to punishment for an infraction of the laws of either.</text>
            <text syncTime="4272.656" offset="17193984">The same act maybe an offense or transgression of the laws of both, thus, an assault upon the Marshall of the United States and hindering him in the execution of legal process is a high offense against the United States for which the perpetrator is liable of punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4290.098" offset="17263783">And the same act may be also a gross breach of the peace of the State, a riot, assault or a murder and subject the same person to punishment under the state laws for misdemeanor or felony."</text>
            <text syncTime="4303.117" offset="17315819">Now, in the Lanza case, the defendant had been convicted in a state court in violation of the State's liquor laws, the State's prohibition laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="4322.640" offset="17393977">He was subsequently tried and convicted in a federal court of the same sale of intoxicating liquor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4330.944" offset="17427101">And this Court sustained both convictions declaring that one who violates the laws of both a state and the federal sovereign is amenable to the prosecution of both.</text>
            <text syncTime="4347.470" offset="17493243">It's true as Mr. Fisher's pointed out that that was a case that dealt with double conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4354.661" offset="17521977">And it's also true as Mr. Fisher pointed that the Eighteenth Amendment specifically said that both the State and the Federal Government shall have concurrent powers to enforce this amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4372.915" offset="17595016">Nevertheless, the case did not turn upon nor it was rationale to confine to or by those considerations of former conviction and the explicit language of the Eighteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4390.376" offset="17664920">The Court declared and measured an unmistakable terms that one who violates the laws of both sovereigns is amenable to prosecution by both sovereigns.</text>
            <text syncTime="4412.747" offset="17754363">Now, it has been the -- I should like to deal with Mr. Fisher's argument that the policies of the two statutes, the federal and the state statute, are the same or to put in more accurately that their purposes are the same because both interdict the armed robbery of financial institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4447.598" offset="17893752">As Mr. Justice Frankfurter's question suggested, I don't mean that Mr. Justice Frankfurter intimated decision on the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4459.679" offset="17942131">The federal interest protected by the federal statute is that -- of the United States Government's fiscal interest in federally insured banks or in this case, a savings and loan association.</text>
            <text syncTime="4478.221" offset="18016214">Whereas the purpose is observed by a state statute is that of protecting its citizens against marauders, armed depredations and the loss of the property without regard to any federal or other insurance interest in the institution that is the subject matter or whose employees are the victims of a robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="4514.570" offset="18161664">But even if the purposes could be said to be identical as where a state and federal criminal safety may -- statute, if there were no preemption of the field, might be said to be identical in both for preserving -- intend to preserve human life.</text>
            <text syncTime="4536.482" offset="18249331">We say that although there are different interests protected, there needn't be, that it's inherit and implicit in the concept of dual sovereignty that's generated by the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4551.744" offset="18310353">That both sovereigns have the right to prosecute each independently of the other and that -- that one of the prices paid for dual sovereignty is dual powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4570.838" offset="18386735">With -- as in this case the possibility that an acquittal by one sovereign may be followed by a conviction in the forum of another sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="4582.442" offset="18433128">That is the general understanding of the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4589.369" offset="18460818">Repeated trials for the same offense don't necessarily deny due process, don't always constitute double-jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4596.992" offset="18491329">I might call attention to the fact that Mr. Justice Holmes speaking for -- I believe the unanimous court held in the Flemister case that where a Filipino shot two officers in a rapidly successive shots, double-jeopardy wasn't offended by two prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4620.331" offset="18584743">So it's not true, as Mr. Fisher's argument would suggest, that every time a man is tried twice as a result of the same acts, due process is denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="4640.138" offset="18663946">It's well to note too that generally, throughout the United States, even the same sovereign can prosecute twice for closely related offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="4659.941" offset="18743150">Since this case was argued last, Your Honors have held in the Ciucci case that where -- by a majority of the Court, that where a man by a single burning and rapidly successive shots, murdered the wife and three children each of the deaths was a separately punishable crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="4687.047" offset="18851610">And Your Honors have held in the Hoag case that successive robberies in a same transaction give rise to conviction on the second charge even though there was an acquittal on a former charge.</text>
