            <label>Mr. George Cochran Doub</label>
            <text syncTime="45.303" offset="181185">If the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.782" offset="199053">This is an appeal by the United States from a decision of the Court of Claims holding that a wartime order of the War Production Board took private property for public use under the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.436" offset="265718">The order involved was issued by the War Production Board 10 months after this country entered the war in October 1942 as part of the effective mobilization of our industry for the prosecution of the war and is known as Order L-208.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.732" offset="342831">It remained in effect until June 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.792" offset="359131">So it was in effect for something over two and half years.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.279" offset="381074">The order required all gold mines classified as unnecessary or rather nonessential to this country's war effort to be closed in the shortest possible time and it prohibited them from acquiring, consuming or using any material facility or equipment for mining purposes except minimum amounts for maintenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.407" offset="493610">The essential question then is whether the order should be deemed a non-compensable temporary restriction upon a business or from the use and enjoyment of private property in the interest of the national defense or as the Court of Claims, the undertaking of private property under the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.258" offset="576993">Now, I might say these respondents complied with the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.689" offset="590681">They suspended their mining operations and I'm -- they made no attempt to contest the validity of the order by affirmative or negative legal proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.720" offset="650867">These suits were brought in the Court of Claims under a special reference statute passed by Congress in 1952 which conferred upon the Court jurisdiction to hear and determine the claims in question and waiving any statute of limitations or latches.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.961" offset="727771">In the second War Powers Act of Congress in 1940, Congress provided that in the interest of national defense, the President might allocate the supply of any material or any facilities for defense or for private account or for export “upon such conditions and to such extent as he shall deem necessary or appropriate in the public interest and to promote the national defense”.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.337" offset="857339">Now, that was a broad comprehensive draft of congressional power to the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.579" offset="890253">And the President, by a series of executive orders, delegated that power to the War Production Board which was composed of Donald Nelson as Chairman, the Secretary of War, Secretary of Navy, other Cabinet Officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.742" offset="962873">John Lord O'Brian was the distinguished general counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.624" offset="978442">Now, this was the Board that was exercising that statutory power of the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.763" offset="1018984">And it was that Board which converted a laissez faire, free economy into a regulated economy with speed and efficiency to an extraordinary extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.919" offset="1083664">It converted our economy from a peace to a wartime basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.220" offset="1104875">Now, how did it do this?</text>
            <text syncTime="279.501" offset="1117936">Regulation was primarily through thousands of priority orders, material conservation orders and orders limiting, curtailing or prohibiting the -- the production of nonessential products and restricting the use of critical war materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.921" offset="1199647">So through this WPB regulation, raw materials, machine tools, machinery and equipment were channeled in nonessential users to essential users.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.031" offset="1252101">The War Production Board issued so-called the L orders of which this was one and thousands of other type orders which resulted in severe financial losses to enumerable businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.964" offset="1315840">By L orders, the War Production Board stopped the manufacturer, passenger automobiles, stoves, refrigerators, office equipment, bar graphs, vending machine, metal household, furniture and other metal commodities.</text>

            <text syncTime="420.315" offset="1681241">Well, let me tell you what was the result of these orders regardless of technical form.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.713" offset="1714782">In May of 1942, the War Production Board predicted that within six months as the result of their orders, 24,000 manufacturing businesses would have to close.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.748" offset="1782909">Now, what the actual consequences were of these orders, if the Court please, we don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.373" offset="1809450">But we do know that in the years 1942 through 1944, the total business concerns in the United States excluding real estate and insurance, such things, declined by 201,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.137" offset="1888444">And it's certainly fair to assume that a material part of that decline was attributable to this wartime regulation of the War Production Board.</text>
