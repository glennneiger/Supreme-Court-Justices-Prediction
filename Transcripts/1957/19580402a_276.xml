          <turn speaker="leon_b_catlett" startTime="0.000" stopTime="657.464">
            <label>Mr. Leon B. Catlett</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">-- the complaints in this case were filed in the United States District Court at Little Rock, Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.123" offset="40438">One of the complaints is against R.S. Rainwater &amp; Sons, a partnership and other against Citizens National Bank of Walnut Ridge, Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.046" offset="80144">Jurisdiction in both complaints is grounded upon a False Claims statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.681" offset="106684">It's alleged that these petitioners made and caused to be made and presented and caused to be presented false claims to the Commodity Credit Corporation, an agency at instrumentality of the Government of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.599" offset="178364">Briefly, it's alleged in these complaints that these petitioners caused to be transmitted to Commodity Credit Corporation, 14 transmittal letters on which were listed 98 cotton producers' notes, secured by bales of cotton, which was ineligible under the Commodity Credit Corporation cotton program for 1949 and caused Commodity Credit Corporation to pay these notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.159" offset="320575">And as shown by the transmittal letters, which Commodity Credit Corporation would not have done if it had known the true facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.000" offset="355997">Now, motions to dismiss were filed in the United States District Court and those motions were sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.418" offset="389642">The case was appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit.Eight Circuit reversed in 242 F.2d, this case came upon certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.089" offset="440320">Now, as I say, the jurisdiction in each of these complaints is based upon the False Claims statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.634" offset="474488">The False Claims statute was enacted in 1863.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.320" offset="497267">It originally provided in the one statute for criminal punishment and civil recovery against any person who should make or cause to be made or present a cause to be presented, a false claim against the Government of the United States or a department or officer thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.385" offset="589531">It was just the one statute provided for criminal penalties and civil recovery, and that was in 1863.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.772" offset="631014">In 1878, the False Claims statute was divided into a civil portion and a criminal portion, 1878.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.195" offset="676780">The civil portion became revised statutes 3490 and it provided that any person who should do any of the acts -- commit any of the acts recorded in the criminal portion of the statute, which is Revised Statutes 5438, should be responsible to the Government by a suit for double damages and a forfeiture in the amount of $2000.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.006" offset="808020">In other words, the -- the civil portion of the False Claims statute was 3490 and yet adopted by reference, the provisions of the criminal portion which was 5438.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.249" offset="864967">5438 remained that any person should be punished criminally for making and presenting to the -- a false claim to the Government of the United States or a department of the Government of the United States, or an officer thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.531" offset="938109">Now, that's the status in which we find ourselves in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.199" offset="956709">Now, 3490 has never been amended or dealt with or touched in any manner by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.320" offset="989205">Its Revised Statutes 3490 that we're treating with in this case and it adopted by reference the provisions of the criminal section 5438.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.539" offset="1046152">Now, 5438 was repealed in 1909 and superseded by Section 35 of the criminal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.251" offset="1088993">It didn't change it in any other manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.223" offset="1096829">It still says that a man shall be punished criminally for making or causing to be made or presenting or causing to be presented a false claim against the Government of the United States, or a department or officer thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.343" offset="1161300">Now, that's 1909.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.720" offset="1170808">Now, in 1918, due to the Government corporations which had or began to spring up, in 1918, this criminal statute now, 5438 which subsequently in 1909 became Section 35 of the Criminal Code was amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.303" offset="1265162">The criminal section was, to provide that -- add these words, that anymore persons who makes a cause to be made or presents a cause to be presented of -- of false claim against the Government of the United States or a department or officer or a corporation in which the United States is a stockholder, shall be punished criminally.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.127" offset="1352411">Now, that was in 1918.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.807" offset="1367144">Now, at the present time, that criminal section is found in the Code in Title 18 Section 1001 and Section 2 -- Title 18 287.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.660" offset="1430570">It was split but the criminal section is still to all intense and purposes as it was, after it had been amended in 1918.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.565" offset="1478217">But again, we are not concerned with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.121" offset="1496398">It's -- this case is brought under the Revised Statutes 3490.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.115" offset="1524402">Now, in the code, it says that it's Section 231 of Title 31 but that is just the West Publishing Company's idea about it, I guess you'd say, because when I read and traced it back, I wrote West Publishing Company to find out if they haven't made an error and they then gave me the details of the history of Revised Statutes 3490.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.251" offset="1640908">And as I say, that is the section that we are dealing with and that section has never been ordered or amended or dealt with in anyway by our Congress since 1878 and when it adopted that reference 5438.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.875" offset="1723455">And of course, this Court held in the In re East Company and Kendall against United States and of course, it's always been the law that when one statute adopts another statute by reference, any changes in the adopted statute does not affect the adopting statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.590" offset="1810286">So, any changes that were made in the criminal section, Revised Statutes 5438, as it was changed in 1918 did not affect the civil -- False Claims statute 3490 on which these complaints were based.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.924" offset="1887608">Now, the -- this Court said in United States Marcus -- ex rel. Marcus versus Hess case that it was the duty of the Court to discover and not direct the legislative will.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.400" offset="1965558">Now, in this case, we would love to see, what was the intension of Congress in the amending of the criminal statute 5438, the best place to look we thought would be the record at the time of the passage of that Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.020" offset="2052075">It -- Mr. Gard, Congressman who -- Congressman Gard, who was the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee at the time of the proposal of the amendment to the criminal section 5438 said that it was proposed in order to extend the provisions of 5438 so as to cover a corporation in which the United States was a stockholder.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.799" offset="2175164">That is the House -- Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee at the time the amendment was proposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.509" offset="2202018">Now, when it was presented on the floor of the House for passage, in the absence of the Chairman of the Committee, Representative Argall again explained to the House, that the purpose of the amendment was to expand or extend the provisions of that criminal statute 5438.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.925" offset="2291670">Not simply to interpret it but to extend it to make it cover something that it hadn't covered before namely, the pre -- presentation of a False Claim to a corporation in which the United States was a stockholder.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.670" offset="2354678">This Court in a footnote in the late case of United States against Bramblett, I think, it's found in 348 United States, briefly explained the legislative history of the criminal statute 5438 by stating in that footnote that the amendment in 1918 was to extend the provisions of that Section, so as to cover, of course, something that it had not covered before, namely, a corporation in which the United States was a stockholder.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.087" offset="2492291">So, it seems clear to us that the intention of Congress was that 5438, which was adopted by 3490 in 1878, did not at the time of the adoption include a corporation in which the United States was a stockholder and did not so -- and as -- and the criminal statute did not include that until 1918 at the time the amendment was made to that Section.</text>

            <text syncTime="2014.674" offset="8058671">First, as to the fraudulent claims which were made in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.616" offset="8086361">There are two separates suits, one against the Rainwater's and the other against this Arkansas Bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.554" offset="8118126">Now, we alleged that the Rainwater's purchase cotton from producers and at later dates, they arranged for the sellers to sign notes and loan agreements on this previously sold cotton for this fraudulent purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.123" offset="8192418">And that purpose was to put themselves in a position to -- if the market continue to decline and the price of cotton to make this fraudulent loans from the Commodity Credit Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.647" offset="8250514">And that they did that by going to the bank which they control and where officers are and the bank had full knowledge of the fraudulent character of the representations contained in this -- in these notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.024" offset="8324075">And the bank sent forward those notes to the Commodity Credit Corporation and obtained the payment of the value of the cotton with interest and the cotton went up as collateral.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.889" offset="8371513">Now, the fraud was that the Rainwater's and the bank, both had full knowledge that this cotton had not been produced by the persons presenting those notes as was required under the terms of the Cotton Loan Act and the notes did not represent any advances to be made to the cotton producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.976" offset="8475899">Now, the Commodity accepted those notes and it made full payment on the notes with interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="2883.022" offset="11532016">That was from shipyards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.842" offset="11543301">Now, the point is not, that subsequently the United States became the sole stockholder, the point is not, that this Court suggested in United States against Walter that if you construed that statute to apply the corporations in which the United States had a mere stock interest, it might be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.318" offset="11637238">The point is what was the congressional purpose of the statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.219" offset="11656777">What was contemplated by the Congress in passing that statute because the whole argument here relates to the intention of Congress.</text>
