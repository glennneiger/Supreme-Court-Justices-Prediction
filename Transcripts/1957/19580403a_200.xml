            <text syncTime="44.794" offset="179096">The judgment involved is a judgment of the Supreme Court in North Carolina which denied the petition of the petitioner here, Mrs. Kovacs, to enforce in North Carolina an award of the New York Court which had -- which had awarded to her the custody of her child.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.493" offset="285884">The child was then eight years of age, a little girl.</text>

            <text syncTime="79.914" offset="319634">The parties were married originally in New York where they resided.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.694" offset="338756">The marriage occurred in 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.476" offset="349832">The child was born in New York in 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.676" offset="370625">In 1950, the husband brought an action against the wife for divorce in New York and after a trial, judgment was rendered in favor of the husband against the wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.963" offset="431752">With respect to custody, the court held that while it would not have ordinarily taken the child from his mother really by reason of the misconduct which had been found in the case, nevertheless, the Court did so for the reason that he found that the mother's financial situation and circumstances with such as not to promote the interest and welfare of the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.396" offset="549512">There was another problem with respect to custody because the husband was then in the navy and has been throughout this proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="182.857" offset="731324">In 1951 and again in 1952, Mrs. Kovacs made application to the Supreme Court in New York to modify the order which has been made and both of these applications were denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.773" offset="795063">The court presumably finding that there has been no sufficient change in her circumstances as to warrant any change of custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.985" offset="831843">In 1954, however, she married Joseph Kovacs who has been named as correspondent in the original divorce action and she went to live with him in Riverdale, New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.224" offset="892865">Based upon this change in her circumstances, a new application was made, came on to be heard, the Brewers, the grandfather, the father and son appeared by counsel submitted affidavits and upon the basis of the evidence submitted, the court modified its earlier order and awarded custody of the child to Mrs.Kovacs.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.974" offset="995892">With this order, the petitioner here attempted to obtain custody of the child.</text>

            <text syncTime="332.343" offset="1329319">I think possibly, the legal analysis of that situation is that the grandfather is acting pursuant to court order as agent of the father, Brewer, Jr., who was in the navy taking care of the child temporarily pending his service in the navy.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.092" offset="1396297">If he was -- I think the father ever left the navy, the custody of the child would then be turned over to him.</text>

            <text syncTime="1753.102" offset="7012310">There is another jurisdiction which was set forth in the Finley case in the New York Court of Appeals and was actually the origin of the North Carolina Rule about the Reece.</text>
