            <text syncTime="145.256" offset="580963">Mr. Cicenia stated that he was questioned shortly afterwards and then periodically throughout the day.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.621" offset="606459">Many times, he couldn't remember exactly how many.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.915" offset="619624">One of the Newark detectives testified that he was questioned at about 12:30, 12:15, for maybe 30 minutes, 35 minutes, then would return to his cell while other suspects were questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.621" offset="674482">That he was brought out of his cell again at about 3 o'clock, questioned further, returned to his cell and then at approximately 5 o'clock -- 6 o'clock, his statement was taken from him by one of the detectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.589" offset="734354">The detective who took the statement estimated that it was about a three-hour undertaking to write it down in longhand and the petitioner himself recollects about one hour, but I think in this instance, the detective memory would be more reliable.</text>

            <text syncTime="217.390" offset="869460">Now, beyond that, there is dispute in the record and therefore, I would assume that I can't say that that -- there was more.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.922" offset="903628">The petitioner's attorney arrived at the Newark Police Station at 2 o'clock and that is well documented without dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.056" offset="936124">He immediately asked to see the client asking the detective at the desk and he was denied admission at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.946" offset="967784">He was denied admission periodically throughout the afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.752" offset="982936">And the words of one of the detective's, Attorney bother us, comes in one ear out the other, we pay no attention to them, which characterized the attitude of the entire prosecutors and Newark police staff at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.378" offset="1045420">At 9:30, the man's signature was placed on the confession and the attorney was admitted to see him at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.906" offset="1083559">The next morning, he was arraigned before the magistrate and pleaded not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.481" offset="1109891">As the case of the defense prepared for the trial of this case, there was a motion to suppress this confession and there was a motion o inspect it, combined at one motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.161" offset="1164643">Now, the State's brief which says that no effort was made to attack the confession in the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.265" offset="1192960">Now, I would submit that this -- the motion to inspect and to suppress was certainly an attack on the confession and it was raised as early in the proceedings as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.279" offset="1241025">The motion was denied in both respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.373" offset="1249489">The petitioner was neither permitted to have the confession suppressed and he was not permitted to examine it.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.312" offset="1285224">After failing to reach that result, the petitioner pleaded non vult to this -- to the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.324" offset="1325244">He knew he couldn't see the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.098" offset="1332349">He knew it would be a part of the case against him and as the prosecutor of Essex County pointed out, this confession, together with the two others which were taken at the same time constituted the heart of the case against the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.310" offset="1393162">Now these -- these facts raise the question of "When does the right to counsel begin?"</text>
            <text syncTime="354.585" offset="1418240">There's a subsidiary question of whether or not a petitioner in these circumstances may see the statement which he signed prior to his trial, but the emphasis in this case has been the right to counsel during the period between arrest and the arraignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.667" offset="1498593">Now the law has long recognized, and this Court has long recognized, that there is a right to counsel in certain circumstances if the general rights which any defendant may -- may be able to take advantage of.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.193" offset="1560764">Now, the cases have not dealt with this particular situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.951" offset="1579781">It's a right which have been suggested in different context at different times, different places, but the spirit behind all these cases is fairness under the circumstances to an accused.</text>

            <text syncTime="618.345" offset="2473378">The Fikes case which was recently before this Court, again, additional circumstances, but again, it was pointed out that the petitioner was not permitted to see his father.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.961" offset="2515801">He was not permitted to see an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.514" offset="2526041">The case arising in the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the Murphy case, again, great emphasis was placed in the fact that a petitioner was not allowed to see an attorney during the period of his interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.423" offset="2585600">I think when we decide whether or not this is a due process requirement, we are -- Judge Forman stated in the District Court on the boarder line of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.877" offset="2635442">In determining which side of that line we are on, I don't think it's a mess to examine the benefits and the burdens which would result from a rule requiring a presence of counsel during a period of interrogation by police.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.483" offset="2697927">The benefits it would seem to me are substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.924" offset="2711615">In every case, the rights of an accused would be safeguarded by the presence of counsel during or at least from time to time during his interrogation by the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.088" offset="2760307">The situation is one where the accused is alone, is usually confronted with one or many more police or prosecution officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.919" offset="2799595">He's not as advised to his rights, necessarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.089" offset="2812343">The record his statement is not a stenographic record.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.073" offset="2824255">It's a record taken down by a detective or a prosecution official.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.669" offset="2846616">Usually, often, it's leading questions, the petitioner will answer with a yes or a no and then the leading question is written down as if it were an affirmative statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.910" offset="2891546">Naturally, the person can't remember what he said.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.004" offset="2900010">He can't remember what he signed, which is not an uncommon situation even for someone under -- or normal circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.244" offset="2936895">He is not provided with a copy of the statement after he has -- after he has signed it and he usually cannot obtain a copy before the trial when it's used against him by the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.474" offset="2993842">But in addition to this, which is any case where there is prolonged or -- not necessarily prolonged interrogation, beyond this, these circumstances are conducive to much, much worse.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.809" offset="3051207">They're conducive to force confessions, coercion and other unfortunate practices which we know do occur from time to time.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.707" offset="3094779">Now, a criminal case is like a civil case and that it's an adversary proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.764" offset="3119020">Theoretically, the prosecutor is representing the interest of the public, the accused, as well as anyone else but in practice and perhaps necessarily, he has to present the strong points of his own case and the weak points of the defendant's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.752" offset="3178998">But unlike a civil action, the accused does not have the advantage or the opportunity to obtain access to the data, the information, the statements, which are to be used against him at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.641" offset="3234482">His hands are tied.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.679" offset="3238661">They're tied during this interrogation period.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.412" offset="3249633">They're tied right up until the trial itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.893" offset="3263530">Now, the state is partisan.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.410" offset="3269590">It zealously tries to convict the defendants I brought before the court of a state or a federal court if that's the situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="830.694" offset="3322776">But if this zeal is unchecked, we know it can lead to injustice.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.083" offset="3340330">We know for a fact that on occasion, defendants who are innocent have been convicted.</text>

            <text syncTime="2289.267" offset="9157068">Now, if I can explain, we have a system in -- in New Jersey, in -- capital cases of this kind where suspects are taken into custody, we want a representative of the prosecutor's office here to see things are done properly and that's the reason for McCune, McCune did -- he's in and out and so forth.</text>

            <text syncTime="2323.750" offset="9294994">And in the record, you'll find that Cicenia puts it this way, "Oh, they threw, words he used -- they threw a lot of photographs at me.</text>

            <text syncTime="3215.709" offset="12862798">Number two, "He is entitled to know the nature of the accusation and cause of the accusation."</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.744" offset="12894877">Number three, "He is entitled to be confronted with the witnesses against him."</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.490" offset="12921940">Number four, "He is entitled to have compulsory process for witnesses in his favor" and then it ends up the paragraph by saying, "And he's entitled to the aid and assistance of his counsel for his defense."</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.689" offset="12986723">In interpreting that section, if Your Honors please, (Inaudible) I think used this reasoning, is that accused entitled to be confronted by witnesses against them when he is seated in the room alongside of the detective who is hearing this story?</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.395" offset="13073554">Well, of course not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.632" offset="13082436">Is he entitled to have compulsory process for witnesses in his favor?</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.027" offset="13104065">In other words, if the defendant says to the police, "Why don't you see John Doe or Richard Roe held thereof what I say."</text>

            <text syncTime="3308.859" offset="13235409">Now, we have maintained in New Jersey, ever since 1915 and prior to what clearly established by the highest court of New Jersey in 1915 that an accused has the constitutional right to the aid and assistance of his counsel at his defense and that contemplates when he is placed in jeopardy at the trial and not during the time between the arrest and his arraignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.727" offset="13370828">That has been time and time again, Your Honors, State against Murphy, State against (Inaudible) that came to this Court, certiorari denied and I answered exactly the same question.</text>
