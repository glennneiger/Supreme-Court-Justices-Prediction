            <text syncTime="51.226" offset="204904">The Court did so upon the sole ground that Section 21 of the Federal Power Act which provides that licensees may exercise the right of eminent domain, did not and could not authorize Tacoma to condemn a state-owned fish hatchery which is located within the reservoir area and which the project would inundate in the absence of state legislation authorizing a municipality to condemn state-owned lands devoted to a public use.</text>

            <text syncTime="95.564" offset="382224">We are here on certiorari to that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.572" offset="398211">This, however, is not a condemnation action, but a declaratory judgment proceeding which Tacoma initiated to validate a bond issue for a construction of the licensed project after the license was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.321" offset="457247">The State intervened or was added as a defendant upon motion of the State Department of Game and Fishery alleging the violation of its laws and the taking of its property.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.694" offset="510746">This was after the State had unsuccessfully appealed from the Power Commission's order to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and after that Court had sustained the order in a proceeding under Section 313 (b) of the Federal Power Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.311" offset="573231">This Court denied certiorari in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.029" offset="592039">The facts are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.855" offset="603324">On August 6, 1948, 10 years ago, Tacoma filed with the Federal Power Commission the required declaration of intention under Section 23 (b) of the Federal Power Act, and the Commission found that the Cowlitz River was navigable waters of the United States that the project would affect this navigable capacity and the interest of interstate and foreign commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.568" offset="698201">It required a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.175" offset="708650">It entered an order accordingly in March of 1949 and in that order, described the Cowlitz River that appears in your record as a stream with the flow of approximately 10,000 cubic feet per second that is junctioned with the Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.479" offset="769881">The Cowlitz is consequently an important stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.714" offset="782838">That flow is about seven-eighths of the flow of the Potomac at Washington and is about equal to the flow of the Mississippi at St. Paul.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.038" offset="816065">Tacoma thereupon -- thereupon filed its application for a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.504" offset="838008">The project as described by the Commission in the subsequent proceedings in hearings before the Commission would consist of two dams; Mayfield Dam which is 52 miles upstream from the junction with the Columbia, which would rise 240 feet above bedrock and the Mossyrock Dam, 13 1/2 miles further upstream which would rise 510 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.845" offset="935288">The project would cost $146 million and would generate ultimately 460,000 kilowatts.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.157" offset="964545">It would be interconnected through the Bonneville system with the entire Pacific Northwest.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.673" offset="986593">By a comparison, this project is slightly less than the installed capacity of the Bonneville Dam which is just over 500,000 kilowatts.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.715" offset="1022851">The Commission ordered this license issued after hearing objections by the State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.249" offset="1044898">The objections were of two kinds.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.607" offset="1054407">First, that the project would violate the State's laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.528" offset="1070080">It pleaded six of them, including specifically a statute which declared the Cowlitz River to be a fish sanctuary for the protection of anadromous fish, that is, those which spawned in the fresh water, go to the sea, and return to spawn again, which would hatch them, I should say in fresh water, and that that statute prohibited the construction of any dam higher than 25 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.642" offset="1166524">A second group of objections was that the downstream dam, Mayfield, would inundate state-owned lands including a game-fish hatchery.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.442" offset="1205708">The State alleged and its evidence show that the Mayfield Dam were it to create a reservoir which would extend about 400 feet beyond this hatchery and would inundate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.125" offset="1252415">That is beyond the hatchery buildings.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.260" offset="1264953">Tacoma in these proceedings, offered to replace the hatchery.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.193" offset="1280731">The State declined to accept the replacement.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.784" offset="1295047">The State's allegation before the Commission appears at page 292 of your record and is preserved there by the dissenting opinion below.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.626" offset="1334439">The State alleged before the Power Commission, quote “That the reservoirs which would be created by the proposed dams would inundate a valuable and irreplaceable fish hatchery owned by the State of Washington, as well as much productive spawning areas.” It is this same hatchery which brings us here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.277" offset="1417091">Tacoma offered, as I say, to replace that hatchery.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.031" offset="1432033">The Commission refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.374" offset="1445407">The Commission in its order issuing a license, found in the language of Section 4 (e) of the Federal Power Act, that this project would affect navigable waters of the United States and the interest of interstate and foreign commerce reiterating the finding it had made on the initial tender under 23 (b) and that in the terms of Section 10 (a) of the Act, the project best adapted to a comprehensive plan for improving or developing the waterway involved for the use or benefit of interstate or foreign commerce, for the improvement and utilization of water power development, for the conservation and preservation of fish and wildlife resources, and for other beneficial public uses including recreational purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="466.707" offset="1866815">The Commission found -- they called this an exceptionally valuable addition to the Northwest Region power supply because of its size, location and the characteristic of its output and its size I've indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.280" offset="1917074">It is located 60 miles from Tacoma, between Seattle and Portland and as its characteristics it happens that the Cowlitz flows high when the Columbia is low.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.533" offset="1962109">So that the annual peak demand of this entire region comes to the time when the Cowlitz flows at its height and the Columbia is at its lowest.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.592" offset="1998367">The Commission also found pursuant to Section 9 (b) of the Act that the applicant had submitted satisfactory evidence of compliance where the requirements of all applicable state laws insofar as necessary to affect the -- the purposes of a license for the project.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.076" offset="2068271">It found that Tacoma was a municipality within the meaning of Section 3 of the Act and in fact Tacoma has been engaged in the business of generating and distributing power since 1893.It is one of the pioneer public power municipalities of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.206" offset="2140787">The Commission found that the project would create the important navigation and flood control benefits and this order incorporated criteria for the operation of these reservoirs in the interest of navigation and flood control which the Secretary of the Board had recommended and which it's unchallenged, would result in the inundation of this hatchery.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.132" offset="2232424">Confronted by the conflict between power and fishery resources, the Commission ordered Tacoma to install devices which would lift these anadromous fish up over the dams and would get the young fingerlings back down without being damaged by the turbines.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.633" offset="2302433">A complicated set of devices, which together with the hatcheries, which the Commission ordered Tacoma to install, hatcheries would cost all together $9,465,000 at the City's expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.638" offset="2370456">These hatcheries were a part of this large program, were to be designed and installed with the cooperation of the State and --and with the -- the Secretary of Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.481" offset="2421864">The Commission's opinion concludes with the following statement which you will find at -- on page 26 of your record.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.708" offset="2454779">“We are required to consider all of the proposed advantages and disadvantages of the City's proposal from the standpoint of the greatest public benefit through the use of this valuable water and other natural resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.450" offset="2505770">The question posed does not appear to us between all power and no fish, but rather between large power benefits needed particularly for defense purposes, important flood control benefits, and navigation benefits with incidental recreation and intangible benefits balanced against some fish losses, or a retention of the stream in its present natural condition until such time in the fairly near future when economic pressures will force its full utilization.”</text>
            <text syncTime="655.673" offset="2622589">The State, thereupon, petitioned the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to review this order on the ground that the construction of the project would violate the laws of Washington and would take state-owned property which it said Tacoma had not condemned and could not condemn under Section 21 of the Federal Power Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.571" offset="2706181">That court, in 1953, declined to interfere and this Court denied certiorari.</text>

            <text syncTime="1647.495" offset="6589962">And second, as a matter of statutory interpretation, whether Section 21 of the Federal Power Act was intended to vest in licensees who are authorized by the Commission to develop a waterway, a federal power of eminent domain or whether it was intended simply to acquiesce in the exercise by the licensees of condemnation powers derived from state authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.718" offset="6706782">And if a federal power was delegated, whether it includes or excludes property of a State which is devoted to a competing use of the same waterway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.738" offset="6754952">And third, as a matter of constitutional power, whether Congress can lawfully delegate to a licensee the power to condemn state-owned lands which is dedicated to a competing use of a waterway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.621" offset="6806465">And if so, whether it may make such a delegation to a licensee to which the State has not granted that same authority specifically in municipalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.851" offset="6847321">Now, as to the res judicata part, Your Honors, that is briefed at pages 66 to 78 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.097" offset="6876369">The matter we think would be disposed of by the language of the Ninth Circuit, but for a reservation in this opinion which refers to points it's not passing upon.We say that our point is included within the scope of the judgment below.</text>

            <text syncTime="1740.507" offset="6961946">The question of whether or not the Court -- the -- the Ninth Circuit did exclude the question here from its determination relates to the constitutional problem and consequently, I do not intend to argue the res judicata matter, except in connection with the constitutional issue to which I should comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.341" offset="7049300">On the matter of statutory interpretation, we say Section 21 thus clearly intend to vest in licensees a federal power of eminent domain.It is not acquiescence in powers to be derived from the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="1996.618" offset="7986469">And the Court sustained the exercise with the power of eminent domain as being protected by the Federal Supremacy Clause, so also with the Alabama Power Company versus the Gulf Power Company.</text>

            <text syncTime="2067.135" offset="8268487">If we are proceeding now with a -- a specific delegated federal power, the commerce power or the water power, we say that when the States have delegated that power to the Federal Government once, in the Federal Constitution, it is not requisite to the federal exercise of that power that the State is delegated capacity a second time to the agent selected by the United States for the exercise of that power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.683" offset="8374648">If any other conclusion were stated, Your Honors, these federal powers face an embargo or possibility of it from any State because as the cases are clear, there's -- United States has proceeded throughout its history by delegating the power of eminent domain sometimes to federally created corporations, sometimes to state-created corporations, and in some cases, has conferred powers obviously beyond any given them by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.637" offset="8474540">For example, in the early railroad cases in Central Pacific versus the United States, California had authorized, created the Central Pacific Railroad Company with authority to build from Sacramento to the state line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.038" offset="8528144">The United States by statute authorized the same company, a state corporation, to build from the San Francisco Bay, not only to the state line but on to connect with Union Pacific.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.060" offset="8568163">Now, that is one of a series of cases that have dealt with the federal exercise with the federal power of -- over interstate commerce irrespective of whether the agent it selected had state corporate power to receive that authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="2176.148" offset="8704522">It belongs to the Government as of its own right and it may use whatever agency it please, but it doesn't follow because limitations upon receiving the value or the advantage or the need of eminent domain are barred by State as against one of its agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.297" offset="8777143">That is much of an interference with the eminent domain power of the Federal Government because it can choose and select its own agency free from any burden or disability created by a State.</text>

            <text syncTime="2819.846" offset="11279360">The United States, including the Federal Power Commission has three interests in the outcome of this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.161" offset="11304542">The first, of course, is in the completion of the Cowlitz project itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="2851.039" offset="11404121">It is, of course, to the interest of the Federal Government that this long delayed project be completed as was originally anticipated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.203" offset="11440797">At this point, I think it will be appropriate for me to say that as amicus curiae, we did not think it fitting for us to discuss the issue of res judicata which was a subsidiary point in the case and perhaps not the one on which certiorari is granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.289" offset="11497117">But we have no reason to disagree at all with the position of the City of Tacoma that this was an issue which, if not raised before the Federal Power Commission and the Ninth Circuit, should have been raised there.</text>

            <text syncTime="2950.044" offset="11800137">The second ground upon which the Federal Government is interested in -- in the disposition of this case is that Section 21 of the Federal Power Act is an important means for the aiding the development of water power projects in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.600" offset="11866384">It has been used in the past and will continue to be used in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.039" offset="11880072">And since private -- or public bodies are frequently licensees of the Federal Power Commission, it is important to the Federal Government and the Federal Power Commission that the full extent of the powers under Section 21 of the Federal Power Act be presented to in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.434" offset="11945691">And the third reason is, of course, that the Federal Government, wholly aside from the Federal Power Act and Section 21 of that Act, is interested in maintaining its power under the -- and its eminent domain power to take, where necessary in aid of its delegated powers, state property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.467" offset="12017789">Now, before I present the Government's position in the context of this case, I would like to mention two -- or two matters which have been raised in the briefs of the respondent and which will probably be discussed by them at oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.387" offset="12085499">The first is a possible question of mootness.They say that the license given to the City of Tacoma will expire on -- in June 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.009" offset="12128026">And therefore, since it is impossible for this project to be completed in the next few months that the issue of the case is moot and should not be decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.437" offset="12157701">On behalf of the Federal Power Commission, we wish to contravene that position completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.454" offset="12177763">Under Section 13 of the Federal Power Act, the Federal Power Commission, though it can only grant an extension of two years for the beginning of a project, for the commencement of a project, has no -- has no limitation as to the granting of an extension for the completion of a project.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.746" offset="12246936">This project was commenced within the proper time and the Federal Power Commission has before it now an application for extension of time for the completion of the project which is within its statutory power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.286" offset="12297091">So, there is I think no problem of mootness in -- in this case at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="3204.163" offset="12816614">In fact, it has been common for the Federal Government in the aid of its delegated power such as the commerce power to make use of and to endow upon state-created agencies various powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.677" offset="12870635">This includes state corporations, state bridge commissions, state railroads, and state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.006" offset="12895922">The Court is fully familiar with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.610" offset="12906371">They've come to it before the Court very frequently in cases for instance under the Federal Employers Liability Act in which state courts are used for federal purposes.There is a whole history which I believe I will have a chance to go into a bit more in the past, about the use of state courts and state corporations, particularly in the field of railroads and telegraphs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.207" offset="12996754">Now, we draw from this body of adjudications in the Court, this general proposition which we think is all that the Court need go to, to decide this present case, and that's -- the general proposition is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.760" offset="13054955">That in aid, in exercise of its delegated power such as the commerce power, the Federal Government has the right and the authority to grant powers to state-created agencies no matter what the state law may be so long as those additional powers are within the general sphere of activity of the particular state-created agency, whether it be a state court, a state corporation or a state public body that is within the general sphere of activity of -- of the state body.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.453" offset="13177731">Mr. Justice Brewer put it over 60 years ago in talking about railroad corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.797" offset="13199151">He said, “It is, of course, well settled that Congress can grant franchises to state railroad corporations beyond those granted by the State.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.009" offset="13236036">At least, he said a similar kind of franchise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.735" offset="13250873">Well, the term franchise is -- is out of date today, but the concept is -- the concept I believe which I have been stating, that is as long as Congress does not go beyond the general sphere of activity of the particular state agency, the Court or the corporation or the public utility district, or the city, or the municipality, Congress has the power no matter what the State may say to grant this particular additional power.</text>

            <text syncTime="3611.755" offset="14446968">So, we have here a perfectly valid license and all its parts about a license which necessarily requires the taking of this fish hatchery because the fish hatchery is included within the land which the license requires to be inundated by the reservoir which will be created by these dams.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.440" offset="14525753">The third point as has already been pointed out, that all the laws of the State of Washington relating to navigation, the height of dams, diversion, fish sanctuary have been declared to be inapplicable in this situation, both by the Ninth Circuit and by the two decisions of the Supreme Court of Washington in this very case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.045" offset="14600150">Now, I come to a point that -- that we consider very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.319" offset="14613211">Tacoma has the general power under state law of condemnation and it has the general power under state law of condemning state-owned property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.179" offset="14652709">That is, if you look at the -- the statutes of the State of Washington, they explicitly give to Tacoma the power to condemn state property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.680" offset="14686668">Now, the Supreme Court of Washington has said in two cases, one in the earlier case and one on present case, that they had the power to condemn state property if it's not already being used by the State for some purpose, that it's lying idle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3687.916" offset="14751660">But that was the earlier case of Tacoma against State which is cited in the briefs in which the Supreme Court of Washington said that the City of Tacoma had the power to condemn state property which was not then being used for some affirmative purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3702.577" offset="14810279">In the present case, they said, “That does not extend to a property which is being used by the State for some public use.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3712.093" offset="14848313">But going back to what I said before about the general sphere of activity, we think it's fair to say that Tacoma has the general power of condemnation including the power to condemn under state law certain state lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3727.126" offset="14908500">Also, as already brought out, there's no question that this hatchery is necessary for the completion of the project.</text>

            <text syncTime="3884.403" offset="15537528">In other words, what happens is that the Federal Government condemns the project all the cost including just compensation are paid for by the -- the City or the state-created corporation, but the form is used of a condemnation suit by the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3902.742" offset="15610880">Now, that is not provided in the Federal Power Act and we think it's not necessary that it'd be provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3908.662" offset="15634599">My point at this moment is that if that were provided, you have a difference of form but not of substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3916.980" offset="15667827">You'd have precisely that the United States going in and condemning this fish -- fish hatchery on behalf of the City of Tacoma, the City of Tacoma paying the entire cost of the -- of the suit including the just compensation which would have to be paid for the State of Washington and then, the United States would turn over the -- the project to the City of Tacoma.</text>

            <text syncTime="4287.356" offset="17149388">Every time that statute, Section 21 has been cited by this Court, it has always been in terms of a grant of power.</text>
            <text syncTime="4294.418" offset="17177600">It has been the -- the lower courts have treated it this way consistently.</text>
            <text syncTime="4299.272" offset="17197035">The legislative history which is referred to in both the brief of the City of Tacoma and of the Federal Government indicates that there was some objection to it because it was thought of to be a grant of power of the state municipalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4311.294" offset="17245100">Nevertheless, the grant was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="4314.167" offset="17256594">The Natural Gas Act, which 10 years -- 10 years ago adopted the same method for condemnation was considered by Congress to be a grant of power and has been construed by the lower courts that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="4327.554" offset="17310198">And, of course, as Mr. Ely pointed out, such grants of power have been common throughout our history.</text>
            <text syncTime="4331.893" offset="17327543">I also want to point out that the word “all licensees,” in Section 21 must necessarily cover cities and municipalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4339.015" offset="17355964">In fact, s the provision was originally presented to Congress it covered only municipalities and public districts and public service corporations and it was broadened to cover all licensees So, it must necessarily cover a licensee which is a city or municipality.</text>
            <text syncTime="4358.521" offset="17434018">I have -- in relation to the -- the question of the constitutionality of this section as a part in this case, I think I have already stated in general what our position is.</text>
            <text syncTime="4370.398" offset="17481561">That -- that the Federal Government has the constitutional right to confer upon the City of Tacoma, powers which are within the general sphere of activity of the City of Tacoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="4382.653" offset="17530567">The -- this has been -- been decided by this Court in cases involving railroads, bridge corporations, telegraph companies and courts.We think actually that is -- even been decided with relation to licensees on the Federal Power Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4402.836" offset="17611337">I recognize that the First Iowa Hydro Electric case in 328 U.S. did not deal with this precise subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="4409.094" offset="17636310">But the rationale of that case as we read it, and has apparently been read by the Supreme Court of Washington in itself is that a State cannot say, “Our public utility districts or our cities are disabled from performing -- taking a license under the Federal Power Commission if they are otherwise able to engage in that kind of business by enacting various laws relating to navigation and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="4436.615" offset="17746442">It's important to know that the dissent on the first appeal in the State Supreme Court in this case, that a Senator said, ”The legislature of Washington, by passing the Fish Sanctuary Act, by saying the dam -- the dams on the Cowlitz River cannot be more than 25 feet high.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4454.085" offset="17816242">That -- that the legislature of Washington in pro tanto disabled the City of -- of Tacoma from taking this license and the majority said, ”No, they had no right to do that.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4464.945" offset="17859709">The City of Tacoma is still a perfectly good licensee.</text>
            <text syncTime="4468.790" offset="17875069">Now, we think that kind of argument goes as well to the issue which is -- that first appear in this case, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="4474.904" offset="17899520">That is, the power of the state to say, “The City of Tacoma is disabled from accepting the federal power of -- the grant of federal eminent domain in Section 21 of the Federal Power Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4486.895" offset="17947481">We think that the first hydro case, the Oregon case, as well as the -- all the earlier cases involving railroads which companies and so forth, go to the point that once a State has -- shall I say, allowed to come with a plunge into the water, it can't say, “You can't get your hair wet.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4505.847" offset="18023340">That -- that we think is what the State Supreme Court has said here, that under the state law as interpreted by the -- by the State Supreme Court in both of these opinions has said, “Tacoma may plunge into the mill, come with federal power production as a licensee of the Federal Power Commission and then it has said, “But you can't get your hair wet, though you can engage in swimming needs and everything else.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4528.826" offset="18115291">Well, we think that the Federal Constitution prohibits that kind of string from being attached to the -- to an agency, which is otherwise, a perfectly valid licensee of Congress of the Federal Power Commission acting under a statute which is the -- one of the important implementations of the Federal Commerce Power.</text>

            <text syncTime="4841.535" offset="19366139">And the first was that Tacoma hadn't obtained the permit from the state supervisor of hydraulics.</text>
