            <text syncTime="45.759" offset="182962">On Thursday last, I'd made the point that the decision of the court below, the court's holding, was squarely in accord with the controlling decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.686" offset="254642">The Attorney General's letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee which is appended to our brief indicates that the Department of Justice takes precisely the same view of the opinion of the court below as we do, namely, that it applied -- accepted principles of law and simply conformed to the prior opinion of this Court in this very case.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.329" offset="361221">With respect to the factual conclusions of the court below, I pointed out that there are at least a half a dozen independent appraisals of the record that are incorporated in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.975" offset="423811">The trial examiner, the Court of Appeals on the first appeal, the dissenting Commissioners, all of which are in accord with the conclusion, the factual conclusion reached by the Court of Appeals from which I draw the conclusion that it might -- that it should be rather difficult for anybody to assert now that what the Court of Appeals did wasn't rational and didn't reflect a fair assessment of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.565" offset="542198">There were just too many other independent examinations of the record, which came through precisely the same conclusion as the -- as the lower court did.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.220" offset="580859">Now, this morning, I should like to address myself to some of the highlights of the -- of the factual evidence to deal with the competitive offers, the efforts of respondent to retain these four customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.637" offset="654524">I shall refer to the fact that a number of customers were lost to competitors because of even lower offers and then respondent was willing to meet.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.659" offset="698619">I should talk about the practices of -- of respondent's competitors and point out that the -- it isn't true, that -- that all conduct their business in the same way or even substantially the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.411" offset="757551">I shall point out that the offers that were made by our competitors were not unlawful offers.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.798" offset="783151">They were on this record and this -- and this posture of the case of lawful offers of competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.148" offset="804571">And I shall point out that many of the competitive offers were from suppliers who sold only at one price.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.191" offset="836754">I shall have occasion to -- to note that gasoline of the Standard Oil Company of Ohio, the Ohio Oil Company, Pure, Phillips, Cities Service, Aurora, a local refinery.</text>

            <text syncTime="281.763" offset="1127027">This Court doesn't sit to conduct, to make an independent reexamination of -- of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.830" offset="1151269">And I think there's more than enough in this record to reassure, Your Honors, that it isn't necessary to examine the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.219" offset="1176869">If you look at the findings of the trial examiner, if you look at the dissenting opinion of -- of Mr. -- Commissioner -- the Commissioner (Inaudible) and the dissenting opinion of -- of Commissioner Mason and -- and the other -- and that is in the record to which I referred on -- on Thursday.</text>

            <text syncTime="345.316" offset="1381251">Hence, what you mean by -- by response to, we contend that if we continue to give the price, our price, to these customers because of offers made to them at lower level, of lower offers made to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.737" offset="1450945">We were doing so in response to those offers because if we would do our lower price, we would lose in this customer.</text>

            <text syncTime="376.944" offset="1507683">I'd like to deal with how we took on each of these -- and what the record show because I'll come to that -- but -- but for the moment the answer to Mr. Justice Harlan's question, you have this concrete situation in the record, a competitor made an offer to two of respondent's customer, a lower offer than the price that -- that respondent would make, lower than respondent's tank-car price.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.090" offset="1588349">The offer was made to Citrin-Kolb and another jobber that Standard had at that time, Middleton.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.918" offset="1611651">Middleton accepted the offer and was lost to respondent as the customer.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.166" offset="1636624">Citrin-Kolb was persuaded by respondent to stay on despite the fact that the other offer was -- was lower.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.385" offset="1665463">Now, as I understand the argument of Commission counsel here, it is, that the -- that the respondent didn't respond to the offer that was made to Citrin-Kolb because we didn't do anything about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.657" offset="1706527">We simply continued to give the -- the lower price.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.717" offset="1722828">We contend that with lower offers like that being constantly made to our customers, we had no choice but to continue to give them a price not as low as that offered to them by our competitors and these offers were continuous through the -- through the period here in question.</text>

            <text syncTime="458.393" offset="1833482">The issue in the case -- the issue in the case as claimed by the trial examiner in which all the parties agreed to was what the situation was after the enactment of the Robinson-Patman Act in 1936.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.853" offset="1883324">But the trial examiner concerned himself with was whether after that Act became law in 1936, we had a right to keep these four jobber customers and what we have to do in order to retain them as such -- as in the light of the provisions of that statute and whether we have to continue to give them, the lower price that they had received prior to the passage of the Robinson-Patman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.790" offset="1979141">But early history, it did come into the record and it is illuminating on the circumstances under which we did and I'd like to go right to that now, the circumstances under which we did say to go on these customers initially, even before the Robinson-Patman Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="548.558" offset="2194181">Back in 1928 was the -- was the time that the first of these four customers became a jobber.</text>

            <text syncTime="694.753" offset="2779011">And it wasn't until two years later that -- that Standard finally yielded and allowed Wayne to become a jobber.And now, I want to talk about the matter that the Chief Justice laid did they continue to sell at retail.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.088" offset="2832300">Of considerable significance is the fact that when Wayne became a jobber, it discontinued all retail business.</text>

            <text syncTime="725.860" offset="2903353">And Wayne didn't again sell at retail until sometime in 1938 and only under circumstances where being the owner of retail properties and not having an independent lessee, from time to time, Wayne was compelled to operate the station itself at retail.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.342" offset="2973362">And this was also true of Stikeman and Citrin-Kolb.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.097" offset="2992379">They were wholesalers, primarily wholesalers.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.002" offset="3007948">As a matter of fact, after some time in 1938 up until the time of the testimony, Stikeman didn't sell a gallon at retail.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.817" offset="3043265">It just so happened it did have a situation that Wayne had after 1938 where they had to take over a station from time to time and Citrin-Kolb, likewise.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.996" offset="3075971">They sold a very, very small percentage of -- of gas they made -- from Standard at retail.</text>

            <text syncTime="1522.756" offset="6091024">Let me say this, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.904" offset="6095517">First, there's no finding here, although this Court afforded the Commission and the officers to make the finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.744" offset="6118922">There's no finding here that any offers by our competitors were unlawful.</text>

            <text syncTime="1539.428" offset="6157688">But to answer your question further, Mr. Justice Black, it just so happened that these offers that I have in mind that were made at the time of this -- the complaint was filed, one or two -- just after the complaint was filed and before the test was taken were offers by -- by competitors who sold only in one price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.342" offset="6225293">They were not discriminatory prices at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.805" offset="6239190">Let me take one of those.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.289" offset="6245146">The National Refining Company, then a well-known company, in Cleveland, Ohio, that sold throughout the Middle West, in -- in Michigan, but had no outlets in Detroit were seeking to set up a distribution, to set up distribution in Detroit and they went to two of our four customers, Wayne and Stikeman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.172" offset="6332604">They said, “We will give you a better quality gasoline than Standard's at a lower price if you will do business with us.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.408" offset="6361548">Now, it so happens that the precise offer from National to these two customers postdated the complaint, came in after the complaint but the negotiations had been in progress before the date of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.873" offset="6407419">And I don't think the day of the complaint is significant, anyway.</text>

            <text syncTime="1607.092" offset="6428317">As a matter of fact, the examiner ruled out that evidence initially on the grounds that it was evidence after complaint, but the Commission itself reversed the exam and held that the evidence was valid.</text>

            <text syncTime="1767.677" offset="7070616">The fact of the matter is that in 1938, Standard lost another customer to Fleet-Wing Gasoline, (Inaudible) Miller, who -- who did leave Standard to buy Fleet-Wing Gasoline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.333" offset="7109277">And Fleet-Wing had something like a hundred stations with their name of -- and this was the Standard Oil Company of Ohio gasoline.</text>

            <text syncTime="3115.610" offset="12462393">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.668" offset="12478589">One of the real difficulties in clarifying the issue before the Court in this case is the ease with which Standard has repeatedly shifted its position during the course of this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.311" offset="12541179">In the court below, for example, Standard did not attack the finding, the factual findings of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.726" offset="12578900">The Standard said in its brief, the issue before the Court is whether the Commission may reject petitioner's meeting competition defense in defiance of these judicial directors and in spite of its own factual findings that established petitioner's good faith as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.565" offset="12654237">Again, on page 6 of their brief, and these briefs had been filed with the Court, Standard says, “The controlling facts are not in dispute.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.958" offset="12699794">Standard thereupon asked for reversal on the basis of the Commission's own findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.873" offset="12723409">The court below agreed with Standards as to what the question was that was presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.980" offset="12743889">The court below said, “We are confronted here only with a question of law, not a question of fact.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.287" offset="12769071">We are not limited,” the Court said, "by the admonitions in this Court -- in this Court's decisions in Staley and other decisions about interfering unduly with the -- the administrator process.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.903" offset="12819540">The Court said, “We're dealing here only with the question of law and the correctness of the Commission's legal decision depends solely on the correctness of its legal reason.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.232" offset="12860918">That is what happened in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.768" offset="12871053">Now, it is true that toward the end of its opinion, the Court, and what I think was only a matter of obiter dictum said -- it did -- said -- make a statement on what -- what Standard now says is the gist of the entire decision below and on the basis of that statement, it now comes to this Court and for the first time, says that this Court should defer to the decision below of the Court of Appeals because it would be improper to undertake the de novo appraisal of the record in the same way that the court below did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.037" offset="13028101">We submit that the only question is one of law and that Standard at this late date cannot undertake to attack the findings of fact by the Commission, even apart from the question of whether, as Mr. Justice Frankfurter pointed out, the Court of Appeals would have been obliged to defer to those factual findings.</text>

            <text syncTime="4074.367" offset="16297378">As to three of them, there is no evidence, no evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="4086.731" offset="16346906">You will find, if you will look at Commissioner (Inaudible) opinion, not a single reference to a single competitive offer that was made to these three jobbers prior to the time they were granted the tank-car price.</text>
            <text syncTime="4099.285" offset="16397061">In fact, Commissioner (Inaudible) opinion is quite different from Standard's present position.</text>
            <text syncTime="4104.522" offset="16418064">Commissioner (Inaudible) recognized this policy, but said that they had the right to continue it because everyone else in the industry was doing it and because there were certain offers after they had been accorded the tank-car price.</text>
