            <text syncTime="32.110" offset="128418">It was in the light of that background that the Court ordered the production of the grand jury proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.857" offset="167393">Before doing so however, the Court sought to find more specific facts of -- as to the use of these proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.459" offset="217757">Those facts of course, being only known in great part by the Government, and he asked the -- “Mr. McDowell, do you object to submitting a detailed affidavit” --</text>

            <text syncTime="98.444" offset="393718">The answer to that question, which appears on page 197, was slightly less than revealing.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.067" offset="424229">The answer was this, "I am afraid that I would be of little value because I had no connection with this case until last year, and will be unable to address myself to anything in that connection.”</text>
            <text syncTime="123.093" offset="492356">That was followed by a letter, “Well, Mr. McDowell,” saying the question -- this is on 360, "The question which you put to me at the hearing on December the 12 relating to the use by the government of the transcripts of the grand jury testimony have been given serious consideration within the Department of Justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="198.678" offset="794645">Now, the -- the Court specifically adverted in his order to the serious, complex and unique procedural of problems involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.513" offset="850024">And on the question of relevance, we call attention to this fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.666" offset="882625">When the Government sought the grand jury documents and that was contested by the defendants, the only statement they made was that they are relevant or material to the issues of this case and are needed to the aid of the plaintiff in the preparation of it, and that's the limit of their statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.173" offset="980637">The grand jury transcripts were intertwined or became later and were part of the same investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.270" offset="1021074">And this -- these later queries got no additional information.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.136" offset="1044480">These documents and the transcript were jointly used, and I want to add this statement of the counsel, well, of the Court and then of the counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.894" offset="1091500">The -- the Court says the plaintiff has never contended the transcript is irrelevant to the issues in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.150" offset="1140506">Indeed, such a contention would be disingenuous in view of the fact of the plaintiff's use of the transcripts.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.623" offset="1170390">Now, that's on the background, they wouldn't tell him what the use was.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.295" offset="1193169">The plaintiff does not deny that it intends to use this evidence in the -- in the future, if the occasion should arise and they were to place no limits on its use.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.506" offset="1250011">And they are the ones who knew.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.464" offset="1269760">The plaintiff's counsel said, "I did not understand that there was any question whether the Government had the use of the grand jury transcripts.</text>

            <text syncTime="332.409" offset="1329633">Upon this record, the Court has properly found that the plaintiff has used and will continue to use the transcript while preparing for the trial and he's also found that the defendants will be aided hereby with such production.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.345" offset="1429316">He added this little more specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.533" offset="1442064">“I would not grant these motions, if I thought they were useless or necessary or the defendants possessed -- already possessed all the necessary information or could obtain it by any different remedy.”</text>
            <text syncTime="378.017" offset="1511967">And finally, he concluded that clearly, the ends of justice will be attained by plaintiff's disclosure of the grand jury transcript -- the grand jury testimony and the defendants have shown good cause for the production.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.303" offset="1577169">Now, further in that connection, the -- the Court before this judgment was -- this order of production was signed, sought to get from the Government any suggestions they might have as to the limitation, restriction, narrowing of the order of production but with no success.</text>

            <text syncTime="448.280" offset="1793045">He invited them to submit a form of order and he said this, "Because it might be interesting to see what kind of order you would submit, you apparently don't like the one the defendants have submitted because you think it's too sweeping.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.450" offset="1877786">Now, let's see what you would submit.”</text>
            <text syncTime="473.340" offset="1893355">The reply was, “We felt it unnecessary to cross that bridge before we came to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.178" offset="1916656">Well the bridge was right in front of it."</text>
            <text syncTime="482.144" offset="1928568">And then he said, "Again, let's see what kind -- what kind of order the Government is going to submit.”</text>
            <text syncTime="493.478" offset="1973812">The Government did not offer an order, did not suggest a change in the form of order, but on the contrary, consented to the form of the production order.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.025" offset="2036088">That appears on pages -- page 262 to 263.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.886" offset="2067540">Now, the decision of the Court in ordering this production was not a general and sweeping decision applicable to all types of cases, it was made on the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.312" offset="2141205">And among other things he said this, "I don't want to make a burdensome big case more bothersome for anybody.</text>

            <text syncTime="593.326" offset="2373277">Now, I will -- I think the question before this Court on the part of production, is -- to me seems a simple one and that is whether within the discretion of the District Court he can determine what information is relevant, needed and appropriate for the defendants' preparation of a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.163" offset="2488633">The burden of showing an abuse of trust -- of discretion is on the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.377" offset="2517473">I'll give you the background, his efforts to get information which he could not get and having before him only the fact of the statement, admitted statement that they used as transcript, to draw the complaint and to prepare for the case and they failed to give him any more definite information.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.846" offset="2611304">It's been suggested that some of these witnesses were witnesses of the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.324" offset="2633247">The defendants particularly in this type of case wouldn't have much allowed talking to competitors who had charged these other defendants.</text>

            <text syncTime="670.189" offset="2680686">It would be impossible for them to get a sufficient knowledge to equal the knowledge which the Government had and stated it had and use this as the basis for the entire action.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.040" offset="2760098">The -- another feature of this case is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.872" offset="2791445">If with -- if with a judge who's been from the case since it started and with the knowledge and full statement he made of his efforts to get particular information, if his to be overruled then the effect is merely, to transfer the burden of administration of these big cases to a higher court.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.346" offset="2877336">He must be left with that and your remember Judge Friedman's report, which ties in with just the thought I'm giving you.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.728" offset="2914847">Now, the other question I want to make is the question of mutuality.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.852" offset="2943373">We -- the defendants -- the -- the plaintiff has all the information he needs from this transcripts.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.592" offset="2986318">I will bring the suit of an interrogatories, depositions in the case and to determine the witnesses, the type of examination with or without that information.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.408" offset="3065626">And the Court said, the Court concludes this is the plaintiff has used in the transcript containing relevant information, the ends of justice require the Court to order the plaintiff to produce and permit the inspection and copying of the transcripts, equal use of transcripts by defendants, will give them the same knowledge and so forth that the Government has.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.243" offset="3172937">The -- it reminds me which -- of a citation which I know has been said many times to this Court, this question of mutuality, when the Government becomes a moving party and levels the great powers against the citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.043" offset="3264157">It should be held with the same standards of fair dealing, as we prescribe for other legal contest, to let the Court -- let the Government adopt such lesser ones, as suits the convenience of his officers, is to start down the totalitarian path and that's the opinion of one of your members.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.526" offset="3354018">The -- the Government is seeking to convert the grand jury proceedings, not into the shield, it was proposed to be, but into a sword to use against defendants in civil actions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1373.941" offset="5495745">That is a -- an executive action.</text>

            <text syncTime="1384.049" offset="5536183">The first is, I think, it's perfectly apparent that the taking of depositions could not supply particularly, with the lapse of memory and the length of time involved could not supply what the sworn grand jury testimony could.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.515" offset="5614028">And the second thing I want to say, is that the -- the type of case, which is somewhat repetitive, the type of case involved here does not really raise a question of -- of violating secrecy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.751" offset="5698978">There is no absolute secrecy of grand jury proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.390" offset="5717473">I could list you and I listed in my brief on there many ways in which they are known and the courts have decided, and we cite their authorities, that after the grand jury has been discharged, that these -- this secrecy need not necessarily prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.312" offset="5817156">And also, I point out there, the various methods in which with all propriety under the law that they, the grand jury proceedings can be known to the public and that's all I care for to say, at least.</text>

            <text syncTime="1514.764" offset="6059050">Now, this dismissal order that was entered by the court below on the motion of the Government was a voluntary order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.800" offset="6111190">It was voluntary, not merely in the technical sense that the Government made the motion that induced the dismissal order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.528" offset="6150060">It was a voluntary order in a real sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.837" offset="6167301">There was no reason whatever, why the Government had to see dismissal of this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1626.465" offset="6505848">I want to explain quite specifically, the sense in which I'm using the word "voluntary".</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.390" offset="6533538">First, as a matter of background, the Government as a general lawyer has explained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.963" offset="6559765">The Government had no time, although invited by the Court on several occasions, submitted any suggestions or counter suggestions as to the scope of the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.265" offset="6608980">They had no time offered to supply some recent testimony of the witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.773" offset="6631027">They have no time suggested that they give the defendants some of the testimony and not all of the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.173" offset="6664673">There was no suggestion as the record shows at 213, at any time, that any of this testimony was not relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.570" offset="6698214">Now, that's the background.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.554" offset="6706155">The immediate point with respect to the voluntary character of the Government's action here is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.946" offset="6739696">Under Rule 37, the trial court has available to it a number of sanctions and remedies in the event of refusal to comply with a production order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.229" offset="6792882">I respectfully say to you, that upon a reading of Judge Modarelli's opinions in this case, it is quite reasonable to expect that if the Government had allowed this matter to take its natural course without precipitating this test case, if they had allowed this matter to take its natural course, Judge Modarelli might very well have made the order provided for by Rule 37.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.048" offset="6904163">For example, to impound the grand jury transcript -- transcripts to forbid the Government from any further use of that grand jury transcript but the Government didn't wait for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.089" offset="6960274">They had a lot of trouble on this issue in a great many courts throughout the country and they wanted to precipitate, this is my surmise, a test of this question quite understandably.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.823" offset="7011265">And so, they adopted the course of moving for a dismissal --</text>

            <text syncTime="1785.196" offset="7140728">I'm not saying they assented to the order of production.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.899" offset="7151595">What I am saying, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, to use language that I believe appears in your opinion in Calloway is that the Government cannot by this device, so by voluntary dismissal, asked this Court to review a question which incidentally, passed the path of a litigation and that is exactly what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.664" offset="7250651">Now, they had an alternative, the obvious alternative was to do what they did in Bowman Dairy and which Mr. Justice Burton wrote the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.092" offset="7288268">It is -- that they say it would have been unseemly for the Attorney General to subject himself to a contempt order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.239" offset="7320869">On the first place, the Attorney General doesn't do it, he gets one of his boys to do it just as he did in Bowman Dairy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.936" offset="7347722">A contempt order could have been entered here against the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.016" offset="7364023">An appeal could have been had from that contempt order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.006" offset="7380010">Now, if the Court please, the practical consequences of that distinction are important, it is not merely a technicality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.700" offset="7410730">If the Government had pursued the contempt route, the litigation could have proceeded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.247" offset="7432986">Meaning, that this is been a year and a half since he entered that order to this day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.936" offset="7451690">Meanwhile, the trial judge, I'm sorry to say has died, witnesses have disappeared, documents have been dispersed and memories including the memory of counsel as to what the merits of this case is about have become vaguer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.282" offset="7517100">And the Government had the alternative in the first place they had alternatives other than the order of dismissal, such as are the impounding of the documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.750" offset="7554926">And in the second place, they had all alternatives to get the question before this Court, the obvious one being contempt, apart from the extraordinary writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.016" offset="7592020">And I say that to my mind, this is a clear case of the Government endeavoring to get a test before this Court without any warrant in law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.614" offset="7634442">Now, very briefly, on the merits of this case, this underlying order is justified in my opinion and here I may have a little difference with my brother, general lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.941" offset="7691703">It is justified in this case because of the administrative considerations in a big case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.778" offset="7723050">Your Honors will recall that the Government does not claim secrecy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.999" offset="7739977">They say we can use the grand jury transcript to prepare the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.547" offset="7758158">We can use it to impeach the witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.555" offset="7766204">They used it 90 times in the Socony-Vacuum case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.747" offset="7782922">They say that at the trial we'll be able to get it and more than that, they say we can get all this material by depositions but what do they say we cannot do and that the trial judge cannot do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.654" offset="7834540">They say that the trial judge after five weary years of litigation and the Government hadn't completed its discovery -- we have not begun ours.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.313" offset="7873202">The prospect of another decade of litigation and they say it's an abuse of discretion for the trial judge to enter an order, an administrative order if you please, allowing us access to this transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.477" offset="7937881">Now, I submit to Your Honors that if there were parts of this transcript that we should not have seen and I can readily understand that there might be in some grand jury investigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.247" offset="7984901">I submit to you that all the Government had to do was to go to Judge Modarelli and say, "Judge Modarelli please examine the transcript from pages 1000 to 2000 and see if you don't agree with us that the defendant shouldn't get that," but that isn't what they're interested in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.831" offset="8055223">They were interested in a test of the basic question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.375" offset="8069433">I'm not criticizing the very able and dedicated lawyers who tried this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.736" offset="8086883">But I submit to you that that is what this case is about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.711" offset="8102766">Now, Mr. Justice Harlan, my -- I do not believe that in any case where a civil case has been preceded by a grand jury investigation, the defendants were automatically entitled to the transcript, by no means.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.701" offset="8166713">I think that there has to be a showing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.177" offset="8184686">First, that the Government has used, is using and proposes to use the transcript and second, and of basic importance, there has to be a real and substantial showing, that the transcript -- that the furnishing of the transcript for an investigation for examination by the defendants will serve a very -- very important purpose as it would here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.040" offset="8284160">Here there's no question about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.899" offset="8291579">It would have served it would have saved at least a year probably, two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.353" offset="8309342">27 living witnesses one of them had died.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.409" offset="8321567">Just imagine all these lawyers here taking the depositions of each one of those witnesses scattered all over the country and how long that would take and that is the course that the Government here requires and -- and it was to avoid that, in the setting of this gargantuan case as it truly is and was that Judge Modarelli exercised his discretionary power and said, "You may have the transcript," even though he invited the Government over and over again to submit limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.333" offset="8457300">I -- and it's perfectly apparent that if they had -- that if they -- this case had taken its normal course as contemplated by law, and that the Government could have obtained a narrowing down of this order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.827" offset="8523233">That's the way law suits are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.625" offset="8530442">And finally, we know if the Court please, there are many cases that come up, many interlocutory and preliminary orders had come up in the course of litigation which seem tremendously important and the rules of this court, the appellant rules, are based upon a very sensible proposition -- are based upon the very sensible proposition that a great many of those offenses get washed out in a force of litigation, they don't prove to be mortal injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.146" offset="8656562">And the case goes on and its tried, one side wins, one side loses and 1001 questions that might have been appealed are washed out in that process.</text>

            <text syncTime="2307.294" offset="9229166">The gist of it is that matters of administrative convenience, expedition and the handling of a big case justify the order of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.609" offset="9270335">Initially, it may well be subject to challenge as to just how much the blanket turn over the grand jury transcripts would expedite the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.000" offset="9307951">Indeed, Government counsel asked that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.337" offset="9317251">Well, if you had the transcript would that mean, you wouldn't take deposition and response would instantly be, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.909" offset="9343582">But even assuming, this would expedite the handling of the case is that a full answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.383" offset="9365525">Must we not proceed further and say is it worth it in terms of what this does to the traditional function of a grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.186" offset="9400738">The essential position of the Government is that it must be, if a grand jury minutes are to be opened up in this wholesale fashion on the account of showing and I -- my own view is Mr. Justice Harlan, correctly characterized as the sort of showing that could be made not only in every antitrust case but indeed in every complex civil case that follows the grand jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="2376.967" offset="9507840">And it's also true however, that in recognizing the traditional secrecy of grand jury proceedings, that the Government is in that position in this cases where they examine an important witness, they are taking before the grand jury for very good reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.323" offset="9577221">They again under oath and he know and you know right from the minute that you do that, but of course you're going to call it so at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.072" offset="9612225">And this secrecy of the grand jury minutes in the context of these antitrust cases in preparation of civil suits is a wholly different proposition to me than what it is in the case of an ordinary criminal proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="2472.135" offset="9888496">I would -- there are two examples that come to mind, of where I think a showing a good cause might have been made here, even if an advance for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.605" offset="9926322">First, one of the 28 witnesses had died between the testimony of grand jury in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.309" offset="9949205">There is no effort to distinguish the demand that his testimony however, from all the others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.852" offset="9967386">If an addition to his death, it could have been shown exactly that he was likely to have been in a position to speak with unique insight about facts relevant to the pending civil proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.390" offset="10017541">On the basis of that sort of showing, I think, the Court after inspection of his testimony by -- by the Court determine if in fact before on pending civil proceeding might well, have been justified in pointing the defendant had shown good cause within the meaning of Rule 34.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.581" offset="10086296">Another instance which, I think, would make out a showing of good cause is the example I used previously of a witness who could not recollect at the deposition stage whether or not he had done a particular act or attended the meeting, but did recollect the deposition stage that he recalled, whether or not he had when he testified before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.776" offset="10175007">There to, assuming external evidence showed that that witness was likely to be in a position to speak with some insight as to the facts that occurred, the district judge might be warranted in finding good cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.338" offset="10221296">For the turn over of a particular better transcript but not for the blanket turnover of the whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.860" offset="10247419">And again really, our position is much has been made of the fact that the Government never asserted any limitations on the order, never attempted to mold the order to what it thought were appropriate limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.757" offset="10290991">But really, that wasn't our role at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.503" offset="10301962">It's not the role of the Government to call out of the transcript those portions that should not be disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.160" offset="10328607">Instead it's the role of defendants to prove good cause, that particular portion should be.</text>
