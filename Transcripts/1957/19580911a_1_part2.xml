            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">Mr. Butler, you may proceed.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Richard C. Butler</label>
            <text syncTime="3.643" offset="14524">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.957" offset="59768">If we are to read the newspaper reports accurately; it appears that the Government of Arkansas has stated that he would again call out the National Guard if he felt that it became necessary to maintain law and order.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.388" offset="125492">The last time that he did that course under this stated purpose, he issued orders to keep the children out of the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.048" offset="164153">If that is accurate, he says he will do that again and then the President of the United States if we are further to read the news reports accurately, he said that he would call the National Guard and then federalize it in order to prevent the Court orders from being nullified or ineffective or interfered with.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.039" offset="268121">Now, these executives carry out their stated plans and obviously, Central High School will again have troops and if it's true that the education processes cannot effectively be carried on with troops patrolling the grounds and the buildings, then action of this Court if it affirms the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, will by all logic and reason seriously impair, if not, virtually destroy the full potential of a high school education for those children at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.558" offset="398211">Now, in one of the briefs amicus curiae, this statement --</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="109.531" offset="438021">They're not before us, Mr. Butler.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_c_butler" startTime="114.499" stopTime="401.424">
            <label>Mr. Richard C. Butler</label>
            <text syncTime="114.499" offset="457979">All right, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.208" offset="460800">Well, if this -- this statement which I have pondered and I'm sure it presents a problem to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.250" offset="492983">This statement is made that no court in history has attempted to enjoin 50 million people.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.552" offset="534152">Now, the author of course, I presume was not referring to Arkansas alone of course, but approximately where there are some two million people.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.368" offset="577411">But to that vast area which comprises some 12 states that's usually referred to the South.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.014" offset="611997">The area, if you please, referred to by one of the justices as he amply observed that national policy might not be the same in Little Rock, Arkansas as it is in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.315" offset="669257">The point that I get from -- form that comment that no court in history has ever attempted to enjoin 50 million people.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.861" offset="711367">It points up simply the School Board's position that they are not in a position to go out with their very limited facilities and -- and seek injunctions against an entire province and if -- and it -- it's emphasized in this quotation that it's in our brief, Mr. Justice Holmes, some years ago in the case of Giles versus Harris, which we quote on page 33 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.455" offset="825783">The substance of it is simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.651" offset="834560">You will recall that the case involved the registration of Negro voters in the State of Alabama and Mr. Justice Holmes made this observation.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.577" offset="886282">He's talking about the State not being a technical party to the sue, but he says, “And if we leave the State out of consideration, the Court has its little practical power to deal with the people of the State in abiding.”</text>
            <text syncTime="238.537" offset="954096">In other words, he was saying even though the State isn't a party to it, if the people of the State which actually are the State, oppose something in mass as very little in a court of equity can do to remedy that particular situation, unless it is implemented in other ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.870" offset="1031419">And he goes on to say that if the conspiracy and intent exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.197" offset="1052735">The name on a piece of paper will not defeat them unless we are prepared to supervise the voting in that State by officers of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.310" offset="1085231">It seems to us that all that the plaintiff could get from equity would be an empty form.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.578" offset="1114279">And then, he ends up by this which we have supplied emphasis to in our brief, a part from damages to the individual, relief from a great political wrong, if done, as alleged by the people of the State and the State itself must be given by them or by the legislature and the political department of the Government of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.061" offset="1204140">He was just pointing out around the practical problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.674" offset="1226606">Now, if we see the issue in this and I -- even though this is repetition, I think it bears repeating that the issue as we see it and distinguished from the issue as set out in the opinion of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals which we think is not the issue in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.165" offset="1304660">Here's why we see the issue.Can a court of equity postpone the enforcement of the plaintiff's constitutional rights if the immediate enforcements thereof will deprive many others of their constitutional rights to an education in a free public school?</text>
            <text syncTime="344.365" offset="1377384">This Court as well as other courts dealing with this disturbing problem and in fact counsel for NAACP joins with courts in recognizing that in a situation such as faces this Court today, equities must be balanced.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.327" offset="1449273">And as counsel has said, “The irreparable harm on the one side as against the harm on the others,” and we submit that if the equities of the school children in Little Rock are the equities that are to be good -- to be given consideration or among those -- then we submit that the scales weighed down heavily in their favor and in favor of the relief which the District Court gave to the School Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.846" offset="1563376">I'd like to adopt also a statement which seems to me to be (Inaudible) from the brief which was submitted by the Honorable J.W.Fullbright, the distinguished Senator from Arkansas --</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard C. Butler</label>
            <text syncTime="432.275" offset="1729097">This question seems to be appropriate to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.834" offset="1747278">Is it not the province of equity to which this Court was committed by the second Brown decision to adopt its statement of constitutional principles to the purposes, functions and abilities of the institutions to which those principles are certainly to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.243" offset="1820944">That is the public school systems in the south and particularly in our case to Little Rock.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.581" offset="1846230">What indeed is the purpose of entrusting equitable jurisdiction to local Federal District Courts, if it is not to permit an appraisal of what can be done to comply with the orders of this Court in the light of good faith, efforts of local School Boards?</text>
            <text syncTime="483.086" offset="1932330">The Circuit Court of Appeals' majority seems to have been cognizant only of the violent and unlawful acts of individual citizens and groups and did not give proper way to the equitable nature of the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.463" offset="2005786">It seems to us that it failed to recognize that there was involve not simply the violence of individual citizens, but the conflict of two sovereignties, the State and Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.863" offset="2055419">This conflict poses problems which go far beyond in a quite different problem, the problems dealing with lawless mobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.722" offset="2090841">They are problems which are not readily solved by federal injunctions in our opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.098" offset="2116336">One of the essential issues is the refusal of a state government to accept the validity of a federal court decision as being a law.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.700" offset="2150713">The realities are that due to an unexpected and unprecedented development, this Court's original objective of procuring for Negro children, education on an integrated basis cannot be provided under existing circumstances, unless one subscribes to the theory that an educational process can be carried on effectively, while troops are the equivalent or in the -- on the school premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.483" offset="2261891">Time is desperately needed to enable us and enable persons in authority to find an adjustment of this distressing conflict.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard C. Butler</label>
            <text syncTime="604.140" offset="2416536">I think that was generally true, Mr. Justice Douglas, but there was one reference in -- in some witness, teacher's testimony and I believe Judge Lemley referred to it and that was that in patrolling the halls, there were glass doors and children in the classroom would see soldiers going up and down the corridors and that that was destructing influence and I think -- and -- and that's why I had reference to.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.010" offset="2507964">I know that that was in the evidence and I believe that it was mentioned in -- in Judge Lemley's opinion, although I cannot be certain of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.279" offset="2549029">No decision which this Court can make will assure the rights the Negro children more effectively than those decisions which are as heretofore rendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.868" offset="2583406">In spite of the full force of the executive power of the federal government, even the use of Armed Forces of the United States, children did not and cannot enjoy it better, we think not even as good an opportunity for education under conditions of turmoil which result from such extreme measures.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.178" offset="2660624">And of course, the education of all children, Negro and white suffer when such conditions exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.514" offset="2702002">We believe that the argument that to accept the decision of the District Court for two and a half year delay is an abandonment of the integration decision of this Court is without merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.905" offset="2751530">Such an argument takes no account of the difference between the annunciation of the constitutional doctrine and the application of that doctrine through the principals of equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.163" offset="2796565">More importantly, it takes no account of the obligation of the courts to adopt their powers to the purposes for which the institution or activity are affected by this powers exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.054" offset="2844212">This Court has stated that courts of equity may and frequently do go much farther, both to give or withhold relief in furtherance of the public interest than they are accustomed to go when only private rights are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.276" offset="2905025">I believe we cite a case to that effect in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.428" offset="2917669">The processes of public education in this country offer the solution, if any is to be found whereby men of different races may learn to abide one another and in the full enjoyment of their rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.961" offset="2971794">If this is agreed, then the systems of education must be respected and preserved and social experimentation in there made tolerable to their purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.311" offset="3025189">One other point that we feel that perhaps it's justified for this Court to take into consideration because after all it is the top court of equity and expects the lower courts and itself to do equity when equitable principles are involved and we simply pose this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.239" offset="3140859">It can be expected that the control of local school boards will fall into the hands of radicals and fanatics.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.198" offset="3180774">In which event, neither the processes of justice or education would be served, unless some reasonable delay is given in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.208" offset="3224764">Now, we pose that as a question and we also believe that it has merit as argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.809" offset="3263216">Now, in the final analysis, this Court being a court of equity, of course it has the power to do whatever it feels, considering the entire record and all of the factors involved is the proper and right thing to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.057" offset="3352137">We again plead for the opportunity to preserve our public education system and that is our primary plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.044" offset="3396127">In the best judgment of the School Board, it has a chance of survival so as to give effective education to the children, only if some reasonable delay is given, whether that delay should be six months, whether it should be two weeks, whether it should be a year, whether it should be two years, it's certainly a matter of opinion and judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.937" offset="3503647">I say again that it was the earnest belief, the well-considered judgment of the School Board that it had the best chance of arriving at solutions to these distressing problems if it were given the period of time within which to work those out and which time was approved by the federal district judge in his judicial discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.689" offset="3618691">Now, we do not say that that is the only time.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.661" offset="3634573">No one can say that that is the precise time when this can be solved.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.299" offset="3657143">It maybe, that in this Court's judgment, six months maybe long enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.467" offset="3681802">It maybe a year will be long enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.860" offset="3695386">That again is a matter of equity to determine, but the case is before you on the basis of what the School Board felt was the shortest period of time or the best period of time within which these solutions could be final.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.380" offset="3785456">We have described the situation where the School Board, a creature of the State is placed between the millstones and a conflict between the State and federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.885" offset="3835507">We believe that we have pointed out the absurdity of the premise that the School District should keep the peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.091" offset="3864346">We think that that is an incredible argument which does not deserve mush attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.159" offset="3888588">It is obvious that the School Board has no police powers as such.We say again that the problem which we feel has not yet been grasped by the respondents and the Solicitor General and by the Circuit Court of Appeals, that there are two elements which must be present in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.139" offset="3988480">First, that a plan of desegregation, that's the first plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.546" offset="4010109">This Board has had that plan and this, the District formulated several years ago and tried in good faith to put into operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.127" offset="4064444">Second, that a plan of adequate enforcement in a word, there has been despite pleas to the Department of Justice by school officials and by the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.272" offset="4121078">Again, we say we're not being critical of that department, but they have not come forth until recently with the suggestion of this kind and their hands have been tied, we feel, to engage in criminal prosecutions where some were possibly indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.398" offset="4205505">Since these dual plans are required and only one is in existence at this time, the least relief that the School District should have is a stay of the plan of desegregation until the District Court is satisfied that a plan of enforcement is in operation and is efficient to ensure an adequate educational program and an educational climate during the operation of the plan of desegregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.174" offset="4364643">This may take two weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.250" offset="4372898">It may take two years, but until an adequate enforcement is an actuality, the plan of desegregation will be effective only to wreak havoc upon our school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.524" offset="4434024">And this Court, as a court of equity, we feel should remand the case to the District Court with instructions to tell that Court that when and if the conflict between the sovereignties is settled and when an effective plan of enforcement, so that the school system can function, is presented and appears to the District Court to have a reasonable chance of success, that until such time, the School Board should be given a postponement of its plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.217" offset="4612807">And we feel that this Court as a court of equity, of course has with in its power to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.557" offset="4646139">Thank you.</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="1167.062" stopTime="2465.498">
            <label>Mr. Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="1167.062" offset="4668186">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.014" offset="4679993">There are one or two preliminary points and then I think, the argument for respondents can be rather briefed, because I think the issues are so clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.049" offset="4728163">The first one I -- I hate to start again in answering an argument, but I take the flat position that this quote, “battle between the sovereigns” was decided with the Constitution when it was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.770" offset="4783020">That was settled some years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.111" offset="4796395">That leads into the second point which is I think it's one thing for a law politician in the State to argue or a political officer in a State to argue, that the disagreement with the Supreme Court of the United States or the doubt as to the power authority of the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.086" offset="4912274">That makes another thing for a lawyer to stand in this Court and argue that there is any doubt about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.585" offset="4934322">And I think that's where we are in this case, for example, the reason to hold up this for this other lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.368" offset="4977371">Mr. Butler said he wasn't -- he wasn't too sure what was in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.013" offset="5004016">Well, here is one batch of laws passed by the legislature in Arkansas, the General Assembly, giving the Governor his authority and here's what has come about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.928" offset="5067651">Since Judge Lemley's order, as a result of Judge Lemley's order, this is the action we can expect to be amplified for two and a half or more years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.556" offset="5126165">This is S.B.No.2, Senate Bill Number 2 introduced by (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.081" offset="5164304">It says, it -- it has been found and it is hereby declared by the General Assembly that a large majority of the people of this State are opposed to the possible integration of, or mixing other races in the public schools of the State, that practically all of the people of the State are opposed to the use of federal troops in aide of such integration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.759" offset="5270988">That the people of the State are opposed to the use of any federal power to enforce the integration of the races in the public schools, that it has now threatened that Negro children will be forcibly enrolled and permitted to attend some of the public schools of the State, formally attended only by white children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.054" offset="5352176">That the President of United States has indicated that federal troops maybe used to enforce the orders of the District Court restricting enrollment in attendance of Negro pupils in schools, formally attended only by white children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.607" offset="5410377">And that the possible operation of a public school in this State attended by both Negro and white children will inevitably result in violence in and about the schools and throughout the District, both endangering the safety of buildings and other property wise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.632" offset="5474429">And that the state or feeling of the great majority of people of the State is such that a forcible mix in the races in public schools will seriously impair the operation in suitable efficient schools and on and on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.120" offset="5524480">And that exact same section is quoted in everyone of this batch of bills which gives to the Governor the right to close the schools, take away the money, use it for private schools to give the state money to private schools, provided they have operated on the segregated basis, and other means of relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.431" offset="5625626">The other batch of bills are bills that are aimed at and I hope despite references have been made to counsel on this side and not to mention who this bill is directed to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.979" offset="5679856">This is an Act entitled, an act to prohibit the fomenting and education and litigation that interferes with the orderly administration of public schools and institution of higher learning, and to prohibit the solicitation, receipt or donation of funds for the purpose of filing of prosecuting lawsuits to define maintenance, divide a penalty and therefore, statute closely like the one in Virginia, which a three-judge court with an opinion, exhausted opinion by Judge Soper, declared to be unconstitutional in which bills are now before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.884" offset="5843487">If time is given, it's obvious from this that in two and a half years, the law will be so crystalized in Little Rock, I mean in Arkansas that there will be no litigation, and they're protected by making sure that there'll be no lawyers to litigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.792" offset="5931154">And that is the reason that the plea is made for time, and whether or not the School Board believes as they do, time is time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.937" offset="5979742">I don't believe, if it please the Court, that ever before has an effort been made to get a watering down of constitutional rights without any basis and although it was brought out in questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.335" offset="6077336">As of right now, these petitioners in this case had given not the slightest idea of doing anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.304" offset="6117146">And that's what gets me to the point that they say that we agree that we should balance equities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.193" offset="6136686">I never have agreed, as a lawyer that you can balance personal equities against constitutional rights, but even if you go into the so-called, what petitioners call equities, with all of the problems that the children went through in that school and the faculties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.333" offset="6225293">Democracy has stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.407" offset="6237623">There's always going to be a measure of difficulty and problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.225" offset="6260820">The School Board is so worried because they get threat in telephone calls and letters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.550" offset="6286106">I don't believe anybody ever in public office that is worth assaulted and make a decision one way or the other that didn't get telephone calls and letters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.975" offset="6315886">That's a -- that's a part of service to democracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.910" offset="6331559">I don't welcome it, but I -- I recognize it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.813" offset="6347233">But I think we have to think about these children and their parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.821" offset="6367190">These Negro children went through this everyday, and their parents has stayed at home, wondering what was happening to there children, listening to the radio about the bomb threats and all of that business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.750" offset="6418913">I don't see how anybody under the sun could say that after those children, those families went through that for a year to tell them, “All you have done is gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.932" offset="6467709">You fought for what you consider to be democracy and you lost, and you go back to the segregated school from which you came.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.446" offset="6501773">I just don't believe it and I don't believe you can balance those rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.316" offset="6521208">So, don't question here of the right of one group of children against another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.833" offset="6547331">The other side constantly talks and indeed Judge Lemley taught about the injury to education.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.218" offset="6592784">It's according to what type of education we're talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.270" offset="6608980">In our brief, I think it started around page 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.809" offset="6627161">We quoted from the decision in the Brown case and the West Virginia against Barnette and the argument of the Solicitor General two weeks ago, as to what education is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.904" offset="6691527">Education is not the teaching of three hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.714" offset="6706782">Education is teaching of the overall citizenship, to learn, to leave together with fellow citizens and above all, to learn to obey the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.905" offset="6763520">Now, we talk about public education.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.009" offset="6775954">We think from those three quotations there is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.843" offset="6787344">That's what we mean and the damage to the education in Arkansas in Little Rock and in Central High comes about to the order of Judge Lemley, which says that not only the School Board and the State came and ensured to submit to more violence and threats of more violence what did federal judiciary likewise should do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.205" offset="6896744">I don't know of anymore horrible destruction of principle of citizenship and to tell young children that those of you who withdrew rather than to go to the school with Negroes, those of you who are punished last year the three -- the few that the School Board did punish.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.799" offset="6987128">Come back, all is forgiven, you win.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.397" offset="7009489">And therefore, I'm not worried about the Negro children at this stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.128" offset="7028506">I don't believe they're in this case as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.278" offset="7045016">I worry about the white children in Little Rock who are told as young people that the way to get your rights is to violate the law and defy the lawful authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.806" offset="7095171">I'm worried about their future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.391" offset="7105515">I don't worry about the Negro kids' future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.196" offset="7116696">They've been struggling with democracy long enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.192" offset="7124741">They know about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.076" offset="7132264">This is actually laid there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.697" offset="7150759">The State of Arkansas with the Governor holding these Bills, refusing to sign them and say publicly that he holds them to see what this Court is going to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.797" offset="7215125">Maybe it's happened before, but I don't know of any others as where the Governor of a State has tried to hold something over this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.627" offset="7254413">And I think that this Court has to recognize that, not to consider this case as counsel for the School Board would say, as to whether or not the children in Little Rock lost some education last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.117" offset="7320451">The evidence in the record is in complete conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.396" offset="7337482">They say that the -- the great feeling of having troops in the school, for the record shows that the President is responsible for sending the troops to Little Rock, but the record shows and I think it's page 269, that they were put in the school at the request of Superintendent Blossom.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.560" offset="7422224">He's the one who put them inside of the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.425" offset="7433613">The president didn't and he's now complaining about it and to show this horrible effect in the record in this case about the effect of the troops being in the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.568" offset="7502263">There is also a witness who is a band director who has his band class and everything up on the fifth floor to round things up on top of the (Inaudible) so the sound goes up and disturb the -- there are no Negroes in the band class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.015" offset="7564016">There are not even Negroes on that floor that he said he couldn't teach, because of the effect of Negroes being down on the first floor the fact that him teaching up on the fifth floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.633" offset="7606439">Well that's stretching a little in my imagination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.128" offset="7616470">I mean, that's moving a little too far, and I think that that's the type of testimony in this record where -- where there's just no basis for it and I would not urge this Court make this effort to balance the harm -- to one of the harm to the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.790" offset="7691076">The next point I like to make is that in the Deep South today, there are three sets of School Boards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.518" offset="7734021">There's one set that is working along and working it out either with or without court orders and working it out on a procedural basis and ranging over periods of years, varying with each School District.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.818" offset="7787207">In other School Boards, it says, “We just won't move at all.” And there's a third group that says, “The only way to move is over a very gradual period of years,” and in this case, we have that -- it's a gradual plan as you can find.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.746" offset="7870903">There was no ultimate time limit on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.990" offset="7879889">It would just go on and on, and it was approved by the District Court, affirmed by the Court of Appeals and not brought to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.563" offset="7910191">We went back down to see if it worked out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.276" offset="7921058">And now, they say that this -- the most gradual of gradual plans can't work, then that group has joined the other group which says, “It just can't work anyhow.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.233" offset="7976856">And so, the Brown decision means nothing, except in the areas where the people voluntarily accepted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.409" offset="8005590">And in their brief, they argue in -- in one particular place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.119" offset="8028473">It's on page 29 of their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.965" offset="8035788">They argue this after saying after two and one a half years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.107" offset="8052402">They say, “If in the nature of things, there will never be any protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.379" offset="8065463">Operation should be suspended until such time as the people by processes of time are taught to respect court decisions and to be \willing on patriotic grounds to subdue the passions which now control their thinking.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.260" offset="8141009">If constitutional rights are to wait for that period, I submit you don't need the Constitution and you don't need this Court, if everybody was voluntarily do right, but it is interesting on this time element.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.014" offset="8204016">These two and a half years must be measured with three different groups of students, Negro.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.495" offset="8237976">The seven now in the record shows will be graduated at the -- within two and a half years, they'd be gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.092" offset="8272353">Now, when the argument is made that rights are not being destroyed, certainly the argument cannot be made that those children's rights on through.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.969" offset="8299833">They are out -- they are out of school.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.129" offset="8312477">The second group, are those that are eligible under the plan to come in this year and the third group or the others in the class which we furthered down the line from the high school going down to the elementary school.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.072" offset="8384261">And so, we took the position from the beginning of this era, that there where -- these three all fell into to one package and you couldn't strike one without striking the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.025" offset="8436088">And constantly, their argument is -- is understandably aimed and only the seven children and to me, that's the most dangerous argument that can be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.150" offset="8480496">It's one thing to say that we need time to put a plan into action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.812" offset="8519158">It's another thing to say that a plan once in action, in -- once in performance should be suspended and stopped or halted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.292" offset="8561162">We have argued in our brief and we've argued from the beginning of this that any application for time is based on the same principle as those who -- and as it was set out in the Brown decision that you ask for time originally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.305" offset="8609123">There's no difference and certainly public opposition is not sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.568" offset="8638171">The most interesting argument I get from the State, I mean from the School Board is that two partners come in, in the case and say.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.871" offset="8675474">I'm not responsible from non-performance because my partner stopped me from performing.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.041" offset="8696163">I don't see a better difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.434" offset="8705672">The State is a unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.780" offset="8715076">The Fourteenth Amendment was aimed against the State, and all of this panoply of state action from the Governor on down is made against them and in that line, I have to comment on the continued resentment of the School Board at any suggestions that they seek to relieve in Hoxie or the Clinton, Tennessee relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.794" offset="8819148">And they say for example that it's not their job to go into court and get an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.369" offset="8845375">They don't have to go into court and get an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.860" offset="8859376">All they have to do is to go in the Court and say to the Court; I suggest that your adjunction in your degree is being violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.547" offset="8894171">We are prevented from -- that's all they have to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.422" offset="8901590">And in Clinton, the -- the judge called in the United States Department of Justice through the Attorney General's office, but there's no action yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.152" offset="8948506">They stood here this morning -- this afternoon and complained that they've been tied up in litigation in this case for three months.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.148" offset="8972539">They could very well have been tied up three months and seen what could be done there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.726" offset="8986854">And indeed, Judge Lemley could have done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.407" offset="9001587">But from the beginning or the end of this case, the record will show that whenever there was a move against integration at Central High School, each step, the School Board made a move to get the Negro kids out of there, each step of the way and they are still at this late date arguing the same point against public violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.947" offset="9111719">And finally, if it please the Court, on the question of -- although we have respondents, the question of relief is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.833" offset="9151321">In our brief, we requested that the Court reverse -- I mean affirm the Court of Appeals, and that the Court set aside Judge Lemley's order and reinstate Judge Davis' orders and Judge Miller's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.498" offset="9233972">But after thinking about it, we would like with the permission of the Court to amend the -- the request of the Court that if the Court should decide to affirm the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit that even to -- mandate to issue forthwith would not meet the realities of the situation because school opens on Monday, and this is a matter of the mandate issuing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.620" offset="9346403">And we would respectfully suggest that if the Court does decide to affirm, that the Court ruled that Judge Lemley's order be set aside and these other orders reinstated as of the entry of the judgment in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.142" offset="9416516">We think that that would give the type of relief and on that, I understand that both sides of the counsel table are in agreement as to this Court clarifying the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.921" offset="9463641">The only question is about time and I submit that the decision, the clarification cannot be made in time given at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.654" offset="9506586">And unless there are some -- one other point I forgot to mention, if it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.071" offset="9532186">On the last appearance, the Court questioned about Judge Davis' original opinions and original orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.332" offset="9565309">We have with us certified copies of each of his two original orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.250" offset="9588924">With the permission of the Court, I would like to deposit it in the clerk's office in case any one would desire to see them and if there are no further questions, we would submit on the ground that the one single issue in this case where the case stripped down is the issue as to whether or not a federal District Court can delay an integration plan, desegregation plan already in progress, solely because of violence and threats of violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.725" offset="9738867">It's a narrow question and I believe it's the only question in this case and we therefore submit that the decision of the Court of Appeals is imminently correct that it should be affirmed or should be affirmed in such fashion as to make it clear even to the politicians in Arkansas, that Article VI of the Constitution means what it says.</text>

            <text syncTime="2465.498" offset="9861956">Mr. Butler, do you have anything in rebuttal?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_c_butler" startTime="2470.937" stopTime="2706.135">
            <label>Mr. Richard C. Butler</label>
            <text syncTime="2470.937" offset="9883690">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.664" offset="9886616">There are a few points that I would like to respond to, Mr. Chief Justice, in regard of what counsel for opponents has stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.555" offset="9938129">First, I would like to comment that there is not much doubt, although there maybe more than I suspect as to what lawyers as distinguished from the great mass of people think the law to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.406" offset="10013571">I think that virtually, every lawyer that has studied constitutional law in any manner recognizes as the School Board recognizes as -- and his counsel for the School Board recognizes that the federal law is supreme and if you do have a conflict between the two, then of course state law or constitutions must give way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.877" offset="10119419">The point that we have made all along is that when you have responsible public officials, columnists and various other people in whom a populist has confidence telling them differences of opinion about it, it creates in the minds of those people some question as to what the law and not necessarily in the minds of lawyers, but in the minds of the great mass of people and in the minds of people who are I say again not basically law violators.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.241" offset="10264869">Now, counsel has commented on the equities in the situation and of course we feel that in the Brown decision, this Court disposed of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.240" offset="10324950">It recognized that there are equities in it that must be weighed, public and private rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.965" offset="10351804">When the Court said, because of their proximity to local conditions and the need for further hearings, the courts which originally heard these cases can best perform this judicial appraisal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.703" offset="10406766">Accordingly, we believe it's appropriate to remand the cases to those courts in fashioning and effectuating the decrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.495" offset="10441979">The courts will be guided by equitable principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.695" offset="10458697">Traditionally, equity has been characterized by practical flexibility in shaping its remedies and by a facility for adjusting and reconciling public and private needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.494" offset="10517943">These cases call for the exercise of these traditional attributes of equity power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.401" offset="10557544">Now, if the record is in conflict as counsel states, there was not much conflict about the evidence produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.512" offset="10601953">But whatever the conflict may have been, we believe that those are issues of fact that have been resolved by the trial court without any successful attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.086" offset="10652317">As a matter of fact, I didn't realize that there was any real dispute about the evidence, the basic evidence of the problems and obstacles that confronted the School Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.512" offset="10713966">We repeat again just posing the question for this Court that if you in effect drive the School Board out of office than other school boards with less moderate views with considerably less determination to follow the law will be replaced thereby.</text>

            <text syncTime="3044.079" offset="12176300">Now, one last thing that I didn't cover in our principal argument and that is that so far as we know and so far as within the power of this School Board, if this Court orders at any time whether it would be Monday or whether it be at midterm or whether it'd be next spring, so far as the administration of the school is concerned at the present time, not taking into consideration what laws might be signed or put into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.724" offset="12322795">We have no way of knowing that, but at least as of this time, there is no administrative obstacle of the School Board that would keep the present Negro children from being transferred from the all Negro Horace Mann School back over to Central High School.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.374" offset="12413492">Now, it seems to me that questions asked by some of the justices at this hearing and more particularly at the previous hearing were concerned about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.678" offset="12462707">Now, in making that statement, we should emphasize again that there are many things over which the School Board has no control.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.487" offset="12505861">But as of the present time, there is no administrative obstacle of the School Board that would prohibit those children, anyone or more of them from being changed from one school to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.681" offset="12562704">That is a process that is done in a limited way throughout the school year on occasions where circumstances dictate that it should be done.</text>

            <text syncTime="3296.113" offset="13184418">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.661" offset="13222557">The Government comes to this Court and asks to promptly affirm the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.292" offset="13265084">Reinstate the order of Judge Davis and make the judgment or order of this Court in such form that it will be effective without the problem of mandate or other procedures upon notice to the parties, so that the action will be noticed to all interested parties at the earliest possible dates and certainly before school opens on September 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.653" offset="13418580">We think that this case, as I told the Court before, involves the question of maintenance of law and order, not only in this community and the State of Arkansas, but throughout this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.703" offset="13494753">The Brown decision as the Government interprets and understands is quite different from what was related to the Court by counsel for the school district.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.406" offset="13569567">This Court said that segregation in public school system maintained by the State is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.493" offset="13629962">It thereby declared that it is a constitutional right of people not to be segregated by reason of race in the attendance of public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.673" offset="13702687">Now, a constitutional right is what we regard in this country as the most precious rights of all the legal rights we have, because it is declared in our basic document creating a union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.230" offset="13776875">And constitutional rights are present and perceived rights and this Court had that in mind in its consideration of the second Brown decision and what kind of relief should be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.562" offset="13846152">It was greatly disturbed and I -- I for one was also disturbed and I'm sure other counsel were about the question of whether there can be a postponement for one moment of the present and personal constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.424" offset="13937685">And it seemed to us and I think the Court deliberated and thought it through that the right has been declared and then it was a consideration not of how long you can postpone these rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.493" offset="14013962">That argument was made to this Court in the first Brown case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.401" offset="14033502">It was said here time after time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.475" offset="14045832">“If you just leave us alone, we'll handle this problem ourselves and we'll give them equal protection under the laws, just give us time,” and the Court rejected that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.583" offset="14106331">The same argument was made at the time of the argument about relief and the Court rejected it again, but the Court said, “The principle you must consider in this matter is that this relief is to be given forthwith unless there are equitable factors which you with the burden of proof can show justify some delay of this constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.105" offset="14244362">But the principal is that you're entitled to the right forthwith unless there is proof that satisfies a Court that there has to be a delay,” and that delay should be for the very shortest time possible under the efforts of everyone in good faith to give to these people the rights that they have been entitled to for many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.676" offset="14354704">That's the way we read the Brown decision and I think that's what this Court said in clear and unequivocal terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.569" offset="14398276">Now, the desegregation of schools has gone forward in many areas of this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.269" offset="14433071">It has gone ahead in the Border States, many areas without any difficulties whatever and in some of the areas of even of the deeper south.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.137" offset="14496496">What is there in this community, Little Rock and Arkansas was different?</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.121" offset="14528470">Certainly, people with the pigment in their skin, black or white were involved in most cases, in most areas where the schools were desegregated without trouble between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.652" offset="14598583">The element in this case is lawlessness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.892" offset="14615510">It is a community, a small number at first at least, maybe more later who decided they were going to defy the laws of this country and I say to you that that's a problem that's inherent in every little village, great city, or country areas of this United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.619" offset="14734420">There isn't a single policeman that isn't going to watch this Court and what it has to say about this matter that doesn't have to deal with people everyday who don't -- who don't like the law he is trying to administer and enforce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.337" offset="14813309">And he has to go against that public feeling and will and do his duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3711.310" offset="14845179">That's the responsibility of every man in this country that's fit to occupy public office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3723.984" offset="14895856">Now, there is another thing that I object to in the brief of the School Board here and in the argument and that's this idea that there are two sovereignties, one on this side, one on this side and they're equal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3742.122" offset="14968477">Let's see how they fight it out and we'll join up with the one that wins.</text>
            <text syncTime="3748.200" offset="14992718">There's nothing to that stuff and that's all it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3754.105" offset="15016333">This country, a union was created because of the need that the states found for some kind of union that would resolve the bitter controversies that arose between the states and it was because this confederation was so unsuccessful in trying to carry on a Government for the people in this small country then that it was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3792.883" offset="15171500">That was a major force in the creation of this United States and that was back in 1787, a long time ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3809.489" offset="15237956">And in the consideration of the problem, what they'd lived through for years in this unsuccessful Government that they had to deal with, they poured over the problem of what are you going to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3828.151" offset="15312562">We want to keep these two sovereignties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3830.953" offset="15323742">We want to keep the benefit of the State and the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3836.826" offset="15347252">The states to carry out the function of local order, maintaining law and order and the various functions of the state government and on the other hand, the national government with all of the functions that were delegated with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3858.103" offset="15432411">But they passed the laws in a confederation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3861.407" offset="15445577">The laws were good.</text>
            <text syncTime="3863.191" offset="15452682">You look on -- you look at them on the books and you'll find many of them were excellent laws, but the states decided which ones they were going to enforce and some they did and some they didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3877.082" offset="15508271">And so, you had havoc and this country had great difficulty in maintaining the revolutionary war in part because of the condition of its Government and the fact that it could not get support for the laws that were passed that would not be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3898.993" offset="15595938">So, in their contemplation, the founding fathers went over this matter very carefully and they finally concluded that there was only one way to handle it and that was by Article VI in the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3921.137" offset="15684545">And in that, you'll recall the supremacy between a conflict or in a conflict between the federal government and the state government is disposed of.</text>
            <text syncTime="3936.481" offset="15745881">In our basic governmental document for all time and it says this Constitution and the law is pursuant to it and the treaties made under its authority of the supreme law of the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="3964.499" offset="15857894">Now, how anybody could say there could be any doubt about it with that in our basic Constitution?</text>
            <text syncTime="3973.748" offset="15894988">It seems to me, impossible, but they didn't leave it just to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3979.784" offset="15919125">They went on to say that it was going to be binding upon all the courts, not only the federal courts but all the state courts, all the courts of this country wherever they sit are bound by that law not withstanding any laws to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4007.917" offset="16031660">What else could they do?</text>
            <text syncTime="4009.484" offset="16037930">This was their major problem in the Government they had just had that was so unsuccessful.</text>
            <text syncTime="4019.282" offset="16077113">They decided that everyone who was an official in the legislature or the official of the Government, not only the federal government, but of also of every State in the Union should take an oath to support this Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4050.225" offset="16200829">And it was done deliberately and purposefully to deal with this very problem, so that each and every one of them would feel obligated as a man regards his oath to carry out the laws of this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="4071.810" offset="16287138">And then, after that, this Constitution was not imposed upon any states or any people of this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="4082.242" offset="16328934">It was submitted to them for their vote and they have ratified it because they wanted it and they have always wanted it and they want that provision in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4095.789" offset="16383060">So, I say to you, if the School Board has any doubt about what the law is, it can turn to the Constitution that it is under oath to support just as the members of this Court and myself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4115.984" offset="16463935">And in accordance to the manner in which they have regard integrity of their oath, they can find where they should start to find the law and I say to them, “If they can't find it for themselves, they should look first to the Constitution.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4135.595" offset="16542302">That's what the Constitution, our basic document says and then they can look to any federal laws or treaties.</text>
            <text syncTime="4140.715" offset="16562782">And then, they can look down to see if there are anything in the content, if there is anything in the constitution of the State or the state laws or their own regulations that they should enforce, but I say I think without any proper challenge that their obligations before this country in their community and before this Court is to use all the power that they have and exhaust it to try to perform that oath and first start out with trying to carry out the obligations of the Constitution of the United States as interpreted by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4212.491" offset="16849920">Now, the indication in this brief -- argument is that the School Board has found out how the people of this community feel, how strong the feeling is against the desegregation of schools in accordance with the Constitution of United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4238.315" offset="16953260">And so, their plea actually to this Court is very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="4245.377" offset="16981473">Let us wash our hands of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4249.078" offset="16996310">It's a difficult problem and I don't mean to minimize for a moment that it isn't difficult, but I don't think anyone in public office was trying to do the right thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4267.697" offset="17070707">He has ever had an easy time of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4270.669" offset="17082619">He has difficult problems, difficult decisions to make and if you respect his conscience and his honor, he tries to carry it out to the best light he can see regardless of any force or violence or mass opposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4294.804" offset="17179167">I'm not willing to recognize that under the law, the School Board can separate itself from the State of Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4305.382" offset="17221486">It is one of the governmental instrumentalities of that State.</text>
            <text syncTime="4312.276" offset="17249071">This state action we're talking about is a state action that the Fourteenth Amendment prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="4325.017" offset="17300062">And when the State is acting in violation of the rights of these people under the Constitution, whether the School Board participated in it itself, whether it sort of washed its hands of it or stood aside, it is still bound by it because it's in privity with it and this Court must look through it as a legal proposition and see that this in fact is state action that occurred all the time to make it difficult for this program to be carried out in accordance with the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4372.150" offset="17488562">None of the proposals here for delay comply with any of the requirements suggested by this Court in the second Brown decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4384.892" offset="17539553">It requests for delay and modification of the plan should be made, none of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4393.437" offset="17573721">During the argument, if there is any doubt about it prior to that time, it was fully clarified.</text>
            <text syncTime="4400.761" offset="17602978">We want to do nothing, just nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4406.420" offset="17625652">We won't try to educate the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="4409.435" offset="17637669">This is an educational process.</text>
            <text syncTime="4410.940" offset="17643729">At least they could come forward and say, “We'll tell the people that this Supreme Court has spoken.</text>
            <text syncTime="4417.706" offset="17670792">That's the law of the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="4420.850" offset="17683331">It's binding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4422.036" offset="17688137">We've got to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4423.501" offset="17693989">The sooner we do it, the better.</text>

            <text syncTime="4581.044" offset="18324167">It is an expression that has been known to the English Chancery law for many, many years.</text>

            <text syncTime="4605.860" offset="18423432">It was by Mr. Justice Holmes in 222 U.S.in Virginia against West Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="4616.566" offset="18466168">It includes both the elements of acting deliberately and with speed and I think it was carefully chosen because of the problems that the Court recognized their work in this kind of a situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4634.356" offset="18537326">There had to be a deliberate, careful exclusion and inclusion in each case in order to satisfy the requirements of getting this constitutional right into being as rapidly as possible throughout this country and preserve the public school system which was the objective of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4676.436" offset="18705659">And in conclusion, let me say that on this Supreme Court building has carved the inscription “equal justice under law”.</text>

            <text syncTime="4702.624" offset="18810462">It is there as a reminder of a great objective of this Court in all of its decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4713.989" offset="18855915">Now, in the gravity of this new challenge to constitutional rights, I respectfully suggest that each time that it becomes an issue, the Court must say in a manner that cannot be misunderstood throughout the length and breathe of this land, there can be no equality of justice for our people if the law steps aside even for a moment at the command of force and violence.</text>

            <text syncTime="4785.041" offset="19140127">In solving it down, it's simply that equitable principles should apply and that the local District Court should apply those flexible equity principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="4795.537" offset="19182132">The Honorable Solicitor General says that only in cases where there is proof to show a cause for delay should delays be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4806.182" offset="19224660">We submit, Your Honors that this record is replete with reasons for delay and we rest our case on those reasons I set forth in Judge Lemley's decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="4871.567" offset="19486198">I don't know that that's a proper argument in this case, but the Solicitor General has posed a question and I think it is a question that this Court must deal with.</text>

            <text syncTime="4954.155" offset="19816594">But the Honorable Solicitor General has says that there is nothing to discuss, the way he puts it about there being a conflict between two sovereignties.</text>
            <text syncTime="4965.831" offset="19863301">Well now, the School Board has been under the impression that there has been such a conflict, the result of which caused troops to be within the area under one commander and a day or two later, under another.</text>
            <text syncTime="4982.725" offset="19930802">Now, if that isn't a conflict between the federal government and the state sovereign, I'm not aware of what could be.</text>
            <text syncTime="4993.842" offset="19975314">The Honorable Solicitor General refers to the Court provisions that the federal law is supreme and of course as I said before, all lawyers recognize that, but one of the basic problems, there are some students of the Constitution who have read other provisions such as the one that says that, “Rights not specifically delegated to the federal government shall be reserved to the states or to the people.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5022.573" offset="20090253">Now, a good many people, not only in the South have been reading that provision of the federal constitution and have gotten alarm about the disregard of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="5082.248" offset="20328908">Now, the School Board cannot separate itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="5087.036" offset="20348134">It's true, as pointed out by the Honorable Solicitor General, but the prospect of this Board is if the State will separate it from its function and that's what one of their problems that we have involved in this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5105.384" offset="20421486">Now, the School Board, according to the Solicitor General, should try to educate the people.</text>

            <text syncTime="5118.522" offset="20474044">I believe it will in Judge Lemyley's opinion, but the fact is and it's undisputed that the Superintendent of Schools and other members of the School Board or -- or members of the School Board, he is not actually a member, went through the community of Little Rock for at least a solid year after the first Brown decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="5144.072" offset="20576235">I think I'm correct in saying that in over a period of at least two years, he and others explained the plan, explained to the people of the area that in their -- that this had to be done in some form and if this was a plan that the School Board had felt was workable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5167.569" offset="20670276">Now, that was done and it was done to the very best ability of that School Superintendent and that School Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="5176.780" offset="20707056">If my memory serves me correctly, Mr. Blossom appeared some 250 times over a period of time in various groups, both in his office and in the public forum, trying to educate the people of that area as to the distressing problem and the probable solutions of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5198.863" offset="20795350">And he and the School Board felt that they had at least the acquiescence of the people of that community.</text>
