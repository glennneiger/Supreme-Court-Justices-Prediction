            <label>Mr. Joseph Forer</label>
            <text syncTime="15.585" offset="62276">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.345" offset="77322">This is a deportation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.436" offset="89652">The petitioner, Frank Bonetti, was born in France of Italian parentage.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.503" offset="113998">In 1923, when he was 15 years old, he entered to the United States and then was admitted for permanent residence as a quota immigrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.866" offset="159451">In the depression year of 1932 in Los Angeles, he joined the Communist Party of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.233" offset="192888">And sometime during 1936, he dropped out of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.858" offset="223399">He understood that communism meant the public ownership of the principal means of production.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.846" offset="251298">And he did not believe that the Communist Party stood for the violent overthrow of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.173" offset="276689">It is interesting that in both 1932 when Bonetti joined the Communist Party and 1936 when he left the Communist Party, the presidential ticket in California, in those election years, included candidates on the Communist Party ticket.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.767" offset="362998">Some months after Bonetti left the Communist Party, on June 28, 1937, he left the United States and went to Spain to fight on the side of the Spanish Republic in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.619" offset="430393">He did so as he testified because he felt that Franco, in the Franco rebellion, was an instrument of Mussolini and Hitler and he felt that the Rome-Berlin Axis were not stopped in this particular aggression in Spain, they would persist in aggression until the a World War would start.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.107" offset="508343">Bonetti was in active combat in Spain, was wounded and lost a foot.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.819" offset="535197">Late in September of 1938, he returned to the United States with a visa and was stopped (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="143.646" offset="574485">He was given a hearing before a Board of Special Inquiry to determine whether or not, he should be admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.705" offset="598727">At this hearing, he testified fully to his having been a member of the Communist Party between 1932 and 1936 and he testified that he had fought in Spain on the side of the Spanish Republic.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.879" offset="651494">The Board of Special Inquiry ordered him excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.545" offset="666122">That was appealed and that decision by the Board of Special Inquiry was reversed by the -- in Washington, by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.213" offset="708754">So that on October 8, 1938, for the second time, but that he was admitted for permanent residence, under the new quota of for that year, as a quota immigrant and as a new resident.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.481" offset="781897">Since that day, of October 8, 1938, when he was readmitted, he has resided in the United States, in California.</text>

            <text syncTime="218.420" offset="873639">He could not have been -- there was no provision of law in 1938 which excluded persons who had previous -- who had before been the members of the Communist Party.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph Forer</label>
            <text syncTime="230.235" offset="920869">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.645" offset="938527">Now, he has resided in the United States since his second entry in October 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.524" offset="962038">In the summer of 1939, he did leave the country for a one-day trip to Mexico and returned the same day or the next day.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.396" offset="1005505">He has not belonged to the Communist Party since he left it in 1936, so the -- he has not belonged to the Communist Party at any time since he came back to the United States and for some time before that.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.999" offset="1067990">In 1942, Bonetti married a native born American citizen, to whom he is still married and he became the stepfather of her two children.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.551" offset="1114175">In 1940, Bonetti obtained his first citizenship papers and in May of 1943, he filed a petition for naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.895" offset="1155553">The Immigration and Naturalization Service interviewed Bonetti in 1944 and 1946, about his citizenship application.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.874" offset="1191393">In those interviews he testified to having been a member of the Communist Party in the period mentioned and to have been fought in Spain.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.441" offset="1225665">His application was not further processed, and it wasn't passed, and he just never became a citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.056" offset="1256176">On September 23rd, 1950, 14 years after Bonetti left that party, the Congress enacted over the President's veto, the Internal Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.122" offset="1304451">Also known as the McCarran Act, Section 22 of that Act, "Provided for the first time, for the expulsion of any alien who was at that time was entering the United States or has been at anytime thereafter, a member of the Communist Party of the United States."</text>
            <text syncTime="344.106" offset="1376340">A year or so later in October of 1951, the Immigration and Naturalization Service instituted deportation proceedings under this provision against Bonetti and he was ordered deported under that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.767" offset="1443004">In the deportation proceeding, the sole evidence of his past membership in the Communist Party, which was the ground on which he was deported, consisted of Bonetti's own admission, namely, the testimony that he gave before the Board of Special Inquiry at his exclusion hearing in 1938, the statement that he made on his alien registration form which asked the question what organizations had he ever belonged to.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.536" offset="1562122">The statements he made to officials of the immigration in -- of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, when they interviewed him in 1944 and 1946 on his application for naturalization and the statement he had made to an Immigration and Natural -- Naturalization Service Investigator.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.402" offset="1657522">After Bonetti had exhausted his administrative remedy, he filed suit here in the District of Columbia for declaratory judgment and to enjoin the deportation, the District Court gave summary judgment in favor of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.888" offset="1715513">This was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.144" offset="1732545">Now, the statute under which petitioner was ordered deported, that is the Internal Security Act, as well as the current Immigration and Nationality Act, which the court below mistakenly could apply, but which technically does not apply, but we make no point to that because obviously, both acts should have to be interpreted the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.802" offset="1827109">But both statutes provide for the expulsion of any alien who was a member of the Communist Party at the time of or after entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.670" offset="1874651">Neither statute provides for expulsion of an alien merely on account of Communist Party membership before entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.894" offset="1915507">In this case, the alien made three entries, in 1923, 1938 and 1939, respectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.358" offset="1953332">He was a member of the Communist Party after his first entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.531" offset="1970051">He was not a member of the Communist Party after or at the time of, either of his last two entries.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.332" offset="2001293">So the precise question of statutory construction, which is involved here, is which of petitioner's three entries is included in the statutory phrase which expels aliens for Communist Party membership, "After entering the United States."</text>
            <text syncTime="520.909" offset="2083631">Now, we believe that the statute refers only to Communist Party membership after the last of several entries and if we are right, then the petitioner is obviously not deportable under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.848" offset="2139324">But before turning to the affirmative reasons in favor of this interpretation, I want to deal first with the grounds on which the court below held that after entry or after entering in the statute, means after any of several entries or after any (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="555.184" offset="2220722">The court below pointed out that the word "entry" is defined by the Immigration and Nationality Act, to mean subject to limitations that don't apply here, "Any coming of an alien into the United States from a foreign place."</text>
            <text syncTime="574.101" offset="2296372">This definition corresponds to and was derived from the case definition which had evolved prior to the Immigration and Nationality Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.731" offset="2342870">The court below said, “Well, since an entry is any coming, a statute which expels for a membership after entry means membership after any entry."</text>
            <text syncTime="598.458" offset="2393757">Now, this is plainly a non sequitur.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.851" offset="2411311">The statutory definition of entry merely describes what kind of an arrival constitutes an entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.025" offset="2448091">The phrase, "any coming" is used in the section qualitatively, as it were to mean a coming of any kind subject to certain specified exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.672" offset="2494589">For example, it means the coming for permanent residents or as a visitor, or as a seaman, or in transit, or as stow away.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.069" offset="2536176">The exclusions from the definition are also qualitative.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.324" offset="2557283">For example, an entry doesn't include a coming preceded an involuntary departure, nor does it include a coming which consist of a passage by sea from one American port to another, although exceptions being -- having been first developed by cases in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.700" offset="2634710">Now, it's simply a distortion of language to treat a definition of what kind of conduct, what kind of coming constitutes an entry as -- is positive of which particular coming of several comings, is referred to by other sections of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.228" offset="2712869">The fact that a -- an entry is any kind of coming just does not mean that every statutory reference to entry means any entry.</text>

            <text syncTime="1213.329" offset="4853238">Now, I -- I want to get on to the affirmative reasons why we think that after entering in the statute, refers to following the last entry and only the last entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.070" offset="4904229">First of all, this is in accordance with the general scheme of deportation legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.388" offset="4925544">It is a general feature of the immigration statute that -- and this particularly true of the deportation statutes referring to the expulsion of political radicals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.621" offset="4974446">It's a general scheme of these statutes that once an immigrant has satisfied the admission requirements, he is not thereafter expelled for pre-entry conduct or pre-entry characteristics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.586" offset="5026273">As a general rule, when new causes for expulsion were enacted specially for radicals, they were given retroactive effect only to the time of entry or the period after entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.774" offset="5079040">This represents the policy not to upset a governmental determination of the alien suitability on the count of pre-entry conduct, which did not disqualify them under the law existing at the time of entering.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.847" offset="5135360">It recognizes that once the Government has adjudicated the alien's suitability, it would be a breach of good faith if after the alien has rooted himself in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.207" offset="5176738">The determination of suitability is changed because of conduct which preceded the determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.603" offset="5202338">But it is also established that the governmental determination of suitability is made with each entry made by an alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.133" offset="5232431">A resident alien who leaves the country even for only a day is under the theory of the immigration laws, a newcomer on his return, so these two principles therefore, operate together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.870" offset="5283422">First, a governmental determination of suitability protects the alien against expulsion for pre-entry conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.975" offset="5315814">Second on each entry, there is made a governmental determination of suitability as if the alien were a newcomer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.447" offset="5345698">It follows that the latest governmental determination of suitability that is the last entry provides -- protects the alien against expulsion for conduct which preceded that, namely the last entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.197" offset="5396689">Now normally, these principles operate to the disadvantage of the alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.419" offset="5413616">For example, the alien maybe expelled for committing a crime involving moral turpitude within five years after entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.572" offset="5446217">Under the principle that a returning alien is a newcomer, this five year probationary period starts afresh everytime the alien steps across the boarder and back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.061" offset="5492193">But there is no reason for applying the theory that the reentering alien is a newcomer whenever it makes the alien verso and discarding it in the more unusual case like here in which it makes him better off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.542" offset="5554155">This principle that it is the latest entry which is critical is -- manifested in the text of Section 241 (a) which is the deportation section of the Immigration and Nationality Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.404" offset="5605564">Subdivision 6 to that section provides for expelling persons who are members of the Communist Party after entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.135" offset="5640464">But subdivision 1 of that section expels aliens who were excludable at the time of their entry, including persons who are excludable at the time of entry if they entered without a valid immigration visa.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.232" offset="5696888">And subdivision 2 expels aliens who entered without inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.601" offset="5718309">Now, it is impossible to contend and I am sure that the Immigration Service would not contend that an alien who is lawfully admitted on a proper visa and after inspection is expellable because on some earlier occasion, he had stole it into the country and then left on his own volition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.572" offset="5802214">If that were the case, a privilege of voluntary departure which maybe extended to illegal entrance who have been ordered deported, in order to allow them to reenter lawfully, would be of no or little of value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.846" offset="5863340">So it's clear and I don't think that the immigration service could contest it that subsection (1) of the deportation section, when it says that "Aliens shall be expelled if they were excludable at the time of entry," means excludable at the time of last entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.384" offset="5941499">And subsection (2), when it says that "An alien is expellable if he entered without inspection," means he is expellable if he last entered without inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.092" offset="5984340">It should follow that subsection (6) when it says, "An entry is expellable -- an alien is expellable for Communist Party membership after entry," means after last entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.134" offset="6028434">Moreover, there is one subsection, subsection (13) of this deportation section in which Congress, for reasons of its own, chose to depart from the statutory scheme that is the last entry which counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.813" offset="6091233">And here Congress expressly used the words, "any entry".</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.749" offset="6110981">So under one occasion in which Congress meant any of several entries to count and to be critical rather than just the last entry, it was able to and did expressly say any entry.</text>

            <text syncTime="1552.986" offset="6211918">Now, at the very least, the statute is ambiguous and it is an accepted principle of construction often announced by this Court that deportation laws, because of their harshness, should be construed in favor of the alien.</text>

            <text syncTime="1594.071" offset="6376281">Here, as in the preceding cases, an alien is being banished under a statute enacted years after the cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.197" offset="6408777">And what was this cause?</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.269" offset="6413061">The peaceable exercise of constitutional rights of association and political advocacy, in these cases and the others, it is hard to see.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.295" offset="6449110">I think it is impossible to see any rational connection between the legislation and any of the powers delegated to Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="2187.917" offset="8751647">The basic operative language as to going back and getting ex-members, however, was that putting the Act in 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.130" offset="8784457">Petitioner's position in substance says that in 1940, when Congress was reaching back to make deportable ex-members of subversive organizations, organizations advocating to overthrow by force and violence, that at that time, all ex-members who had since leaving the party, decided continuously in this country, were to be deported.</text>

            <text syncTime="2757.366" offset="11029420">The law unquestionably requires a deportation as an ex-member.</text>

            <text syncTime="2771.004" offset="11083964">Once he's here, he is -- certainly, we submit, no better off for having been legally admitted the second time, than the alien who continuously resided in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.073" offset="11128268">Now, whether Congress intended aliens who took a trip, went abroad and reformed to -- intended to give them a different treatment I think is clear right from the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.377" offset="11173407">In the 1918 Act to which the provisions are printed in the supplemental memorandum made available for the Court, given the text to some of this law, that's on page 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.965" offset="11227847">The two line -- two sentences were put in there, the bottom sentence on the page 3 indicating the provisions on this section shall be applicable to the class of aliens mentioned in this act, irrespective to the time of their entry in the United States, has been carried forward continuously showing it is meant to apply to entries and long time back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.544" offset="11314155">But the Section 3 of the 1918 Act appearing on page 4 of our supplemental memorandum, "Suppose that any alien who having been deported so thereafter returned, shall deemed guilty of a felony and deported again."</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.384" offset="11377476">And there was some debate on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.494" offset="11393881">Mr. (Inaudible) thought this was pretty rough.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.507" offset="11406002">This was very severe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.153" offset="11412584">He spoke of the alien who had some really and sincerely reformed having left the country and wanted to come back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.501" offset="11441946">They asked at the end of his speech, is there anything that permit him to come back and of the country under existing law under this proposed law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.082" offset="11472248">Mr. Burnett I think not and I do not think we should adopt anything that would, because it would open the door to too many cases of pretended reaffirmation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.355" offset="11509342">Now, this was dealing with persons who were actually been deported, but it does indicate the total was that the fact person left the country and sincerely reformed and wanted to come in on a fresh start the proposal Mr. Burnett sponsored of the then bill, thinking in behalf of it, opposed the suggestion that he be allowed any reaffirmation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.360" offset="11597427">Now, turning to -- and between 1918 and 1940, there are three cases decided by this Court, which I think are particularly significant, I'll discuss here in -- in connection with the -- the history of this legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.797" offset="11655105">First of these, in 1929 is, Claussen against Day, which is -- where the question a -- an alien entered in 1912 and reentered in 1918 and in three years later was convicted in manslaughter and the problem was whether this is a conviction in fives years, after entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.498" offset="11725949">This Court held that it was and there was not -- the issue there and the issue in the Volpe case was not, I submit, a one of equality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.424" offset="11761685">What kind of an entry in the sense of was it a visit or was it arrival.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.942" offset="11783732">The -- the Court projected the argument that the word, "entries" should be modified or limited in any way and said one petitioner landed at Boston and is returned from South America.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.103" offset="11824379">He made an entry within the meaning of the Act and the Court construed after entry as meaning after an entry and the second entry there accounted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.199" offset="11868787">But the theory was not that it was after the last entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.227" offset="11876833">The theory was that it -- what he did prior to this deportable conduct was an entry, that's coming in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.378" offset="11909433">Now, in the Volpe case, it was a -- it was a matter of a conviction of the crime involving moral turpitude prior to entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.307" offset="11941198">Volpe came to the United States, was here convicted of counterfeiting, left the United States and came back in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.521" offset="11966067">This Court held that his -- his conviction of counterfeiting in this country was a -- a conviction of a crime of moral turpitude prior to entry -- prior to an entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.479" offset="12033881">We -- in the Court's opinion there, quoted in page 12 of our brief, "We accept that view that word, "entry" includes any coming of an alien from a foreign country into the United States, whether such coming be the first or any subsequent one."</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.697" offset="12106710">Now, the -- the petitioner in his brief, in his footnotes, suggest that Volpe was not really arguing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.097" offset="12140356">He was questioning whether the second coming was in fact, an entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.770" offset="12159060">Petitioner's brief in the Volpe case which I respectfully refer to the Court, does not make any such argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.691" offset="12186749">He speaks of this two comings as two entries, as they reentry and argue the question here that the word, "entry" should defined in one way so that pre-entry conduct should be pre first entry conduct rather than just any pre any entry, pre any entry conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.493" offset="12265953">Now the -- in the third case, 1939 was Kessler against Strecker which this Court interpreted in the 1918 statute, as requiring the deportation only of those members of subversive organizations who were still members at the time the -- the warrant of deportation was served upon them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.177" offset="12360620">They -- they found the statute had no -- the 1918 Act was not intended to reach persons who had left the party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.134" offset="12392490">In 1940, right after that statute -- if I have that case was decided by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.743" offset="12414955">Congress amended and adopted the language -- the retrospective language we're here concerned with today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.725" offset="12450900">In the 1940 Act, Congress repeatedly used the phrase, "entering in the concept of after entry", as they had before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.192" offset="12492696">Now, that phrase it since then been defined clearly as meaning the first or any subsequent entry for purposes of grounds of deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.774" offset="12531043">There was no attempt to modify, limit or change that broad definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.080" offset="12548284">However, in the Kessler and Strecker problem of former members, the Court -- the Congress did enact legislation to change the law as to that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.993" offset="12595931">The purpose of the change was to deport former members of subversive organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.598" offset="12618292">Now, the -- in supporting former members, the Senate report quoted on page 17 of the Government's brief, summarizing that proposed amendment and to also provide that any alien, I'm reading from the bottom, two lines of that page -- page 17, "Any alien who has been a member of such classes at any time after the admission to the United States for no matter how short a time or how far in the past, so long as there was act of (Inaudible) entry, shall be deported.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.949" offset="12791745">That we -- we regarded it's inconsistent for them to read providing he had not taken the trip abroad in the meantime, as being a reasonable legislative construction of the -- of the intent at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.450" offset="12841796">That -- that if you read the way petitioner says that anytime after his admission, for no matter how short of time or how far in the past, so as long as after the date of his first entry and so long as he has not taken a trip abroad or left the United States, at any point since then.</text>

            <text syncTime="3408.335" offset="13633306">One is that the statute in the entire law used entry as meaning any coming and it's very hard to distinguish between the alien who -- who -- or they might come from a country such as alien with a quota has long backlog and who could not afford to leave the country and come in on a new quota with that long wait.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.506" offset="13717943">And the alien from a country which has no backlog on the quota list and could leave voluntarily and come in new quota, easily, they could come back in on a -- on this old one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.026" offset="13764023">I -- I think the distinction that any such decision this Court would made would be making paper formalities of which type of paper came back in on that they get a reentry permit after his 16 months, or did he come in on new visa for 16 months?</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.796" offset="13823164">As determinative when there's no indication that it should be and there is nothing in the statutory language or the regulations to slam any support to such a distinction.</text>
