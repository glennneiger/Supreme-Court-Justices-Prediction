            <text syncTime="27.053" offset="108147">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.236" offset="136882">Our argument would be a divided one.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.926" offset="155690">I will make a few of this statement, my colleague Mr. Billingsley will speak in rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.922" offset="195605">This particular case is here in this Court the second time.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.159" offset="220578">Some time ago, back in 1952, petitioner, a young Negro boy, age 16, is arrested in Montgomery, Alabama and was held three to four days in jail and imprisoned (Inaudible) question.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.766" offset="359027">After that time, he was then indicted.On the next day, he was arraigned, charged with rape and subsequent to that, two days later he was tried, convicted of the crime of rape sentenced to the electric chair.On that occasion back in 1952, his counsel was (Inaudible), I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.098" offset="476369">I don't recall exactly what their exact name but he did not have the same counsel as now.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.965" offset="511791">On the day of the arraignment -- I beg your pardon.He was arrested on November 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.446" offset="557767">He was indicted on November 14th, 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.194" offset="572709">Now, from the 10th to the 14th of November, he was kept incommunicado in the City Jail of Montgomery and at Kilby Prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.548" offset="614191">He was not allowed to talk with his parents or to have counsel or have been into the counsel.On the 14th of November, he was indicted by grand jury of Montgomery -- in Montgomery County Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.137" offset="676467">Now, on the very next day, on November 15th, he was arraigned some time between November 15 -- November 14th and November 15th term of arraignment, counsel wasn't good for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.333" offset="737280">On the arraignment, his then counsel asked for a continuance in order to (Inaudible) which request was abused.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.686" offset="790674">Subsequently, on the 17th of November 1952, after arraignment, he was shared with the copy of the indictment and a list of the merit which has been drawn especially on the day of arraignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.529" offset="850024">On the trial of the cause, his counsel sought to withdraw pleas, end it on arraignment, pleas to demerits in order that he might attack the indictment on constitutional grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.802" offset="911151">That request was overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.867" offset="923376">All of this is supplied at the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.390" offset="929541">It appears in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.522" offset="942080">The trial then went ahead to a conclusion at which time Reeves is convicted as I've said before of rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.779" offset="979069">This decision was affirmed by the Alabama Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.354" offset="997355">Subsequently, this Court granted certiorari and after a hearing, the Alabama Court which has raised a reversal which is without directions, Kennedy against Alabama and (Inaudible) against Alabama was cited, subsequently, the State of Alabama against Jeremiah Reeves.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.231" offset="1120862">There's no trial in 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.046" offset="1152104">On this particular trial, there is no reindictment of the arraignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.294" offset="1181153">Counsel for the defendant on the petitioner at that time again moved the Court -- moved the Court for permission to withdraw please in it on his previous arraignment in 1952 for the purpose of attack, the validity of this indictment on federal constitutional grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.031" offset="1264118">We have specifically two grounds which we desire to explore.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.867" offset="1291389">One was the fact that under the reversal of this Honorable Court in the previous case, in the citation of the two cases, Kennedy against Alabama and Vermont against Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.622" offset="1338410">It was our conclusion that certain culprit statements and confessions introduced on the previous trial could not that -- that because of those culprit statements and those confessions, the conviction could not stand and it was our conviction and our argument and the effort to attack the indictment this time, that the only thing before the grand jury that indicted Reeves was in fact the statements and the confessions which had been thrown out and without this, the indictment could not stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.414" offset="1509564">Secondly, it was on the confession that the grand jury, which indicted petitioner contained absolutely no Negroes and that the system of the State of Alabama of throwing members of such grand jury said at that time was designed to exclude members or to discriminate against them by reason of their race and color then tried to the provisions of the federal constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.718" offset="1630772">The trial court without a hearing overruled our motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.864" offset="1663373">We then filed a motion to strike within our drawn to hear this particular case because of exclusion of Negroes from the juries in Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.585" offset="1714260">The trial court set this motion down for a hearing and on the hearing, it appeared that the Commissioners, the Jury Commissioners of Montgomery County at a system of selecting persons for the jury absolutely contrary to the system laid down by the Alabama court and the testimony in fact of the Commissioners showed that they had very little system indeed for the selection of Negroes, although they contended that there was no discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.487" offset="1877891">Judge Eugene Carter, the Circuit judge of the County who testified that he -- members of the Board of Jury Commissioners had been for 27 years -- some years said that his method was to interview some Negroes whom he knew, who suggested names for the -- for the panel.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.955" offset="1979768">But as to identify anyone of such persons, he refused because he said it might embarrass him.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.312" offset="2009234">We asked him to identify anyone particular Negro who might be on the panel jury there at Montgomery County.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.774" offset="2039014">He refused to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.457" offset="2049776">He also testified that he had drawn the grand jury in Montgomery County for the past 21 years that he remembered one Negro and he said on a grand jury, but could not remember as many as two during that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.376" offset="2125427">I also testified that up until the past one or two years, it had been very difficult to get Negroes for service on the jury and that up until the past one or two years, very few Negroes had served.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.708" offset="2194808">Judge Eugene Jones, the Circuit Clerk, Mr. Mathews who also served on the Jury Commission, both testified similarly.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.161" offset="2236604">Their methods of selecting Negroes at the same manner through personal acquaintance by contact of various clubs and organizations, but none of them could designate or would designate a particular club or organization except for the NAACP and the local (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="583.957" offset="2335765">Nor could we get from any of them, particular names of individuals that they knew to be on the jury role of Montgomery County are listed on the jury courts of that County.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.761" offset="2391040">Incidentally, we ask the Court for permission to have the jury role examined by any of these particular witnesses for the purpose of ascertaining whether or no any particular name on such role could be identified by these witnesses who was certainly on a position to know as Negroes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1922.096" offset="7688359">Our contention is that if it was ever introduced, it was introduced this time too, because a prosecuting witness indicates from everything she says and from her actions and the fact that she had to talk with the man.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.329" offset="7749277">She looked at him through a one way window.She did not have to go into the cell.</text>

            <text syncTime="1942.857" offset="7771324">She saw the statement before she went in and then she still had to go in and talk to him and have a conversation with him before she could come out and say she's identified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.385" offset="7813538">But her entire identification was based upon that culprit statement or whatever that confession was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.428" offset="7845616">The State certainly don't have to introduce it into evidence, only by introducing her and letting her point the finger on the petitioner and identifying him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.815" offset="7895249">The State's whole case is grounded upon the identification of the prosecuting witness and the corroborating testimony of one witness called -- his name is Clark who allegedly picked up a colored boy somewhere in the vicinity of the neighborhood where this crime took place on the day in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.579" offset="7990230">And this man, this witness that remember everything in the world about petitioner, but he couldn't even remember the day he talked to him in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.331" offset="8037251">And he -- and the record of the previous hearing, again, this hearing will show that he could identify him until he talk to him, so whatever admissions were made for the basis of his identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.613" offset="8106423">Assuming that we had been allowed on a proper hearing to question those people, those persons who must have appeared before the grand jury and as much as the State's whole case rested up on that identification, if we could have shown that the indictment was granted upon these illegal admissions, then it seems to me on the decisions of this Court and under the Federal Constitution decision and under the law of Alabama which is clearly set out in our statute and in here looking at the State where the Supreme Court is held that were -- the legality of evidence before the grand jury when it's brought up on a motion to quash must be decided by the trial court before they can go on to hear the case on the merits.</text>

            <text syncTime="2403.385" offset="9613479">We have this divided time but we have another argument which we wanted to present, another point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.825" offset="9643259">The petitioner understands that an ordinary circumstances, it's unnecessary to re-indict, to re-arraign a man simply because -- because it's been reversed on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.530" offset="9682024">Usually, the error, if it appears, is some error which goes on the trial of the cause, an error in ruling on the part of the Court, errors of otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.611" offset="9726433">But in this particular cause, we think it is particularly urgent and under the circumstances here, the trial court's refusal to allow petitioner to withdraw his pleas previously in it, which petitioner asked first before attacking the Court's position and asking for reindictment and rearraignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.757" offset="9810965">Petitioner asked that he be allowed to withdraw his pleas in it at his previous arraignment in order that he might attack the legality of his indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.390" offset="9853492">The trial court absolutely refused to allow him to withdraw his pleas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.355" offset="9873345">Now, it is admitted by petitioner that the trial court had discretion to refuse or to grant that request to withdraw pleas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.991" offset="9915873">But we submit that under the circumstances, his refusal to allow to withdraw was arbitrary to the extent that it was -- it's a revisable error and that it did deny the defendant, a very substantial right guaranteed him by these laws of Alabama and by the federal laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="2558.631" offset="10234462">Does due process require the reindictment, rearraignment of the defendant for a second trial?</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.832" offset="10263301">Did due process require the trial court to allow the defendant to withdraw his pleas of not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity entered on November the 15th, 1952 upon a subsequent trial held after reversal of this case by the Supreme Court of the new -- the request being made on May 30th, 1955 and should the defendant have been allowed to inquire into this efficiency of the evidence before the grand jury which indicted him.</text>
