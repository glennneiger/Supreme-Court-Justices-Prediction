            <label>Mr. Leonard B. Sand</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.060" offset="20167">This case arises on the writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which Court dismissed the Government's appeal as untimely filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.056" offset="64157">The facts are not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.795" offset="75128">This was a suit for refund of taxes and the taxpayer moved in the District Court for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.385" offset="109505">And on April 14th, 1955, the district judge granted an opinion which quoted and relied upon the opinion of another district judge in another case.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.028" offset="156108">And that opinion concluded with the language which appears on page 4 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.288" offset="181081">I am in agreement with Judge Leibell's analysis and accordingly, the plaintiff's motion is granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.269" offset="213055">On that same day, the clerk of the Court made an entry in the civil docket which appears at the top of page 2 of the record."April 14th, Rayfiel, J. Decision rendered on motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.946" offset="271778">Motion granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.200" offset="276793">See opinion on file."</text>
            <text syncTime="72.596" offset="290377">On May 24, 1955, the district judge signed a paper submitted not by the Government but by the taxpayer which was -- had a judgment and which appears on pages 4 and 5 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.299" offset="353176">That document after -- reciting that the Court's opinion having been duly filed herein, it has ordered adjudged and decreed that the plaintiff, Schaefer Brewing Company recover of the defendant certain sums spelled out in that document.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.409" offset="421616">The document was stamped, judgment rendered, dated May 24, 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.237" offset="448888">And on that date, the clerk made the docket entry which appears on page 2 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.343" offset="477309">May 24, Rayfiel J. Judgment filed and docketed against defendant in various sums of money that spelled out.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.387" offset="517538">The Government filed its notice of appeal on July 21, 1955 which was 98 days from the original grant of the motion from the decision and 58 days from the filing of the judgment, the form of judgment signed on May 24th.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.426" offset="593607">The taxpayer moved in the Court of Appeals to dismiss the Government's appeal as not timely brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.903" offset="619520">That is not brought within 60 days from the entry of the judgment as required by Rule 73.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.233" offset="648882">Thus, looking at pages 4 and 5 of the record, the first issue in this case is whether the opinion of the District Court granting the motion was in and of itself the judgment of the Court, the final disposition by the district judge of that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.569" offset="726204">Or whether the document headed in a stamped judgment dated May 24th, 1955 submitted by the taxpayer and signed by the district judge constitutes the judgment in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.713" offset="782838">And the second issue, looking at page 2 of the record is whether the April 14th entry decision rendered on motion for summary judgment constitutes an entry of judgment, a docket entry of judgment which contains the nature and substance of the judgment as required by the rules to begin the running of the period within which an appeal must be taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.072" offset="888268">Or whether the May 24th entry is the applicable judgment entry.</text>

            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="229.584" offset="918256">Mr. Sand, may I ask at the outset, in order to appreciate the reach of this -- does the -- in the problem of this kind, appreciate the general problem, but does the specific setting in which the problem arises in the Second Circuit raised the question for all the other circuits or other variations in the different circuits regarding the practice of what they do about, what they say when they file opinions and make docket entries thereon and then later there's a later entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.844" offset="1095367">What is (Inaudible)?</text>
            <text syncTime="276.020" offset="1104039">What is the situation?</text>

            <label>Mr. Leonard B. Sand</label>
            <text syncTime="276.884" offset="1107487">Well, the crucial question that the Second Circuit has -- has held and the other circuits would agree, is the intent of the -- of the district judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.168" offset="1148656">And to some extent in evaluating, in categorizing the words used by the district judge resort has had to local practice.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="297.170" stopTime="308.708">
            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="297.170" offset="1188676">Well, this -- this question may not -- this -- you -- one cannot say that this raises that question of statutory construction which will hereafter govern every circuit.</text>

            <label>Mr. Leonard B. Sand</label>
            <text syncTime="308.708" offset="1234756">I -- I think not.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.807" offset="1243220">I think that one says -- let me make that clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.133" offset="1256490">I think that there is now an explicit conflict between the Second Circuit and the First Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.043" offset="1288150">And -- and that the decision below is also inconsistent with decisions reached in the Fourth and the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.467" offset="1317825">I think that these circuits disagree as to the interpretation of Rule 58.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.185" offset="1344679">Subsequent to the decision in the Schaefer case, the First Circuit in United States against Higginson reached a result which it recognized was inconsistent with the Second Circuit's result.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.817" offset="1411239">The First Circuit said that where the district judge later signs a formal order that becomes relevant in determining whether he intended the first memorandum decision to be his final disposition in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.783" offset="1471112">And referring to the Schaefer opinion said that that was influenced by a local rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.909" offset="1495562">Subsequent thereto, the Second Circuit decided the Matteson case which is reprinted in the appendix to the Government's petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.935" offset="1531716">And in that opinion, Judge Clark said, "No, the local rule merely corroborates Rule 58 and this -- our decision is based on -- on Rule 58."</text>

            <text syncTime="397.447" offset="1589708">I only let you -- see what you have to say but if the thing turns on intent -- intent, maybe what the district judge manage to do, what he sought to be accomplished, then one either has to say that you look for nothing but the word and they must mean the same thing in whatever circuit they arise or if its other things -- other understanding except words, then that's (Inaudible), you must have local differences.</text>

            <text syncTime="427.824" offset="1711229">Well, you -- you look to the words and -- and you look also the words used by the district judge and you look also to the rules of -- of civil procedure which of course a uniform throughout the country to see whether those words satisfy the requirements set forth in the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.560" offset="1782178">But I want to emphasize that there is a clear conflict between the circuits which is in no sense dependent on any local rule of court.</text>
