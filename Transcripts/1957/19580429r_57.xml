            <text syncTime="20.885" offset="83487">Mr. Chief Justice and Members of this Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.843" offset="103340">The rights and remedies here involved were created and controlled by virtue of a South Carolina statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.109" offset="148376">In our brief, we referred to the case of Caughman versus Columbia Y.M.C.A.on page 23 in which case it is stated, "It was stated in Marchbanks versus Duke Power Company, et al., that Workmen's Compensation Acts or in derogation of or departures from the common law and are not a mandatory cumulative or supplemental thereto, nor declaratory thereof but wholly, substitutional in character."</text>
            <text syncTime="72.203" offset="288810">These rights and remedies pursuant to Workmen's Compensation Acts are unknown to common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.287" offset="337084">Certainly, the constitutionality of Workmen's Compensation Acts in the various States have been tested time and again.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.917" offset="379611">I believe this Court held in the Mountain Timber Company versus State of Washington with respect to the Washington Compensation Act, that it's between employee and employer the Act abolishes all right of recovery in ordinary cases and therefore, leaves nothing to be tried by jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.399" offset="465502">Now, the issue of the affirmative defense of the respondent in the present case was before the Court from the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.814" offset="519210">As a matter of fact, this affirmative defense was confronted with issue by motion four times during the trial of this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="151.666" offset="606563">There's one matter I wish to touch on first.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.381" offset="613460">It will revert around to it, Mr. Justice Brennan.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.581" offset="630282">Now, there were four motions made in the trial of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.607" offset="654420">The first motion was by the petitioner at the outset to conceal the compensation issue from the jury because it was a question of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.126" offset="696424">The second motion was made by the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.403" offset="717531">I made the motion at the close of the petitioner, the plaintiff's testimony by way of involuntary dismissal, contending that the plaintiff's own testimony showed that the work being done was a part of the trade and business of the defendant, and therefore the Workmen's Compensation defense was a bar to the plaintiff's action.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.275" offset="821081">Third, at the close of the respondent's testimony, the plaintiff moved to dismiss the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.624" offset="862459">And at that time, the Court inquired of the plaintiff if he had any testimony throughout there and reply.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.070" offset="900180">Then following that, and before exercising his ruling on the motion, the trial judge stated that, “Now, the defendant here is going to make a motion, another motion in connection with his defense at the close of all the testimonies.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.043" offset="984085">Do you have any evidence to put in by way of replying?”</text>
            <text syncTime="250.712" offset="1002789">The plaintiff said, “We make our motion now.”</text>
            <text syncTime="256.648" offset="1026508">Then following that, the district judge said that he would grant the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.841" offset="1055347">But in so doing, and in those pages of the record between 48 and 52, the trial judge said, “I'm going to allow the defendant to make his motion for a directed verdict and I'm going to allow him to include this affirmative defense as a ground of that motion.”</text>
            <text syncTime="288.924" offset="1155657">My point quickly is this, may it please this Court, that the issue was paramount throughout the trial from the outset to the end.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.853" offset="1191393">There was no motion made by the plaintiff to strike his admission with respect to this defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.977" offset="1219814">There was no motion made by this plaintiff to strike the testimony that had been presented throughout the trial with regard to this defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.864" offset="1259416">Certainly, the district judge, the trial judge when he said, “I'm going to keep the matter open.”</text>

            <text syncTime="669.125" offset="2676402">It is an issue of law.In that respect, I wish to refer to our brief again where we cited the Guaranty Trust case.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.872" offset="2715481">And we think that here, it applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.754" offset="2726975">Here is Erie versus Tompkins as applied to our case and if I may to read the quote from our brief with respect to Erie versus Tompkins and then to apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.562" offset="2782145">This Court said Erie versus Tompkins was not an endeavor to formulate scientific legal terminology.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.017" offset="2808059">It expressed a policy that touches vitally the proper distribution of judicial power between state and federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.597" offset="2838361">In essence, the intent of that decision was to insure that in all cases where a federal court is exercising jurisdiction solely because of the diversity of citizenship of the parties and certainly here, may it please the Court, the jurisdiction of the District Court, the federal court was exercised solely because of the diversity of citizenship of the parties and the jurisdictional amount involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.110" offset="2936372">And going on, the Court -- this Court said the outcome of the litigation in the federal court should be substantially the same, so far as legal rules determine the outcome of a litigation as it would be if tried in a state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.492" offset="2997917">The nub of the policy that underlies Erie versus Tompkins is that for the same transaction, the accident of a suit by a non-resident litigant in a federal court instead of a state court, a block away should not lead to a substantially different result.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.339" offset="3065313">And concluding plainly enough, a statute that would completely bar recovery in a suit if brought in a state court bears only state-created right.</text>

            <text syncTime="1009.034" offset="4036127">In that case, if Your Honors please, it appeared that a claim was brought against the defendant, Hollywood-Beaufort Package Corporation, for workmen's compensation benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.617" offset="4102374">And it also appeared that sometime prior to the petitioner's injuries, the employer was engaged in manufacturing rotary veneer which was used in its principal business of also manufacturing shipping containers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.839" offset="4199340">And under the South Carolina statute where an employer is engaged in the business of manufacturing shipping containers principally, he is exempt from the application of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.934" offset="4275722">Sometime previous to the petitioner's injuries, this employer gave up its operations of manufacturing shipping containers but retained that part of the operation of producing rotary veneer which was placed or used for the manufacture of shipping containers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.110" offset="4384392">The petitioner or the claimant sustained an injury at that time at some time subsequent thereto and the employer sought to deny liability of its responsibility for payment of workmen's compensation benefits under the Act on the ground that it was engaged in the business of manufacturing shipping containers principally and therefore, under the provisions of the Act, it was exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.691" offset="4522736">And the Court very empathically held in that case that the only question presented therefore is whether or not, and I quote, “At the time of the injury and death of John Gordon, the appellant, was subject to and bound by the provisions of the South Carolina Workmen's Compensation Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.918" offset="4627644">And the Court held that since it had no facilities to engage in the manufacturing of shipping containers, which it previously had and had given up those facilities, the Court held that the employer was bound by the provisions of the South Carolina Workmen's Compensations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.821" offset="4747180">Of course, the situation in that case is converse from the situation in this case because in this case, we submit, that if the respondent, Blue Ridge, had any time been engaged in such business of manufacturing substations, the evidence is totally clear in this case that it had not performed such activity for a long time prior to petitioner's interest.</text>
