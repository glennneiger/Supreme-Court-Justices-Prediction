            <text syncTime="58.939" offset="235729">In this case, the petitioner was convicted of violating the federal act in that he had in his possession, 11 cans of alcohol without proper stamps affixed thereto and in transporting those 11 cans of alcohol.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.351" offset="333322">A part of this situation, if Your Honor please, is that the police of the State of New York, pursuant to the authority of the State of New York and the law of the State of New York, had tapped a bar known as the Reno Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.382" offset="417437">And on May the 10th, a message was intercepted wherein the petitioner informed someone else that 11 pieces was going that night.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.543" offset="470100">The officers -- the state officers thought that the 11 pieces meant 11 pieces of narcotics, and following that interception and that – that and having obtained that information, they followed the car and when they stopped the car and arrested the driver, instead of 11 pieces of narcotics, they found 11 cans of unpacked alcohol, thereupon -- thereupon turned over to the federal authorities for prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.853" offset="591412">Now, the heart of this question -- this case is whether a federal statute that prohibits both interception and divulgence of a telephone message and which goes on to the -- to prohibit the -- the use of intercepted message thus it's used in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.086" offset="684304">It seems to me that every case that I've read up to the present time even this last case, the Rathbun case.</text>

            <text syncTime="4500.212" offset="18000771">-- to suppress it via divulgence, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4504.765" offset="18019056">As to the question of the -- the valid -- the conflict between the state law and the United -- in 605, we did not really raise that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="4515.192" offset="18060748">The Government raised it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4516.737" offset="18066913">I presume because of Justice Medina's ruling that the -- as soon as the officer testified, he violated a federal act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4525.293" offset="18101081">I'm inclined to agree with the court below because the two -- two statutes are diametrically opposed to each other and both cannot survive.</text>
            <text syncTime="4535.109" offset="18140369">One is destructive of the other because one says no person shall intercept, and it doesn't mean except the office of the State of New York, while the other will say, we may intercept under certain condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4548.040" offset="18192091">Now, this is a law of general application.</text>
            <text syncTime="4551.267" offset="18205048">If it -- it involves the whole United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4555.673" offset="18222602">It does not exclude the State of New York from its -- from abiding by it and the legislature of the State of New York cannot put Congress out of business by legislating in a different way.</text>
            <text syncTime="4566.957" offset="18267742">It would seem to me that they're -- that they're diametrically opposed and there's a be conflict that must be resolved in favor of the Congress of the United States and the policy of the Congress of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4578.528" offset="18314031">Now, may I add and close here that there have been repeated attempts made to outlaw wire -- that is to amend 605 by permitting limited wiretapping by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="4592.363" offset="18369411">And the omission being that despite the pressure from our -- some of our governmental agencies, the Congress of United States has refused and still refuses to change 605.</text>
            <text syncTime="4605.295" offset="18421133">Now, it would indicate that they have a good reason why they don't want to change 605.</text>
            <text syncTime="4611.498" offset="18445897">And on -- if Congress wishes to change 605, and permit the legislature of the State of New York to have limited wiretapping, Congress can certainly do it by passing the proper act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4623.962" offset="18495843">While 605 stands at -- this now that no person shall intercept the communication, as I've said before, no person means zero and zero cannot be made into numerical numbers other than zero.</text>
