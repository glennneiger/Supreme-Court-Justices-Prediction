            <text syncTime="125.284" offset="604557">There is no case where a man has been acquitted in a federal court and subsequently retried for the same conduct in a state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.980" offset="651264">So I can't say that it’s controlled by any precise authority, but I do say that the authorities that I discussed yesterday and the consensus of understanding by Courts I believe throughout the country generally that each sovereign may prosecute without offending due process seems to be an accepted principle of American constitutional jurisprudence.</text>

            <label>Mr. William C. Wines</label>
            <text syncTime="189.352" offset="860766">I find it indicated Your Honor in the cases that I sited yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.250" offset="888351">I find it indicated in the Lanza case, in the Moore case and in Herbert against Louisiana which is like the Lanza case to the extent that the defendants were indicted for violation of the Louisiana statute, prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquors and were then indicted in the federal court for the same alleged offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.459" offset="1001200">And although there had been no trial in the state court, this Court had occasion to say where such manufacturer that is of intoxicating liquors is thus doubly denounced.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.570" offset="1061700">One who engages therein commits two distinct defenses, one against the United States and one against the State and maybe he’s subjected to prosecution and punishment in the federal courts where one in the state courts where the other without any infraction of the constitutional rule against double jeopardy, if being limited to repeated prosecutions for the same offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.350" offset="1172773">Now, it’s contended that because government officers were very largely instrumental in instigating this prosecution in the state courts that even if multiple prosecutions by different sovereigns does not perceive denying due process that agency of federal officers amounted to a double prosecution by federal authorities once in the federal court and once in the Courts of Illinois.</text>

            <label>Mr. William C. Wines</label>
            <text syncTime="332.248" offset="1432325">Only to say Your Honor, that -- there do -- that did seem to be a -- a general principle and does seem to be a general principle against repeated prosecutions for the same crime and there are I do think old English authorities do tend to support his contention, but those authorities found utterance at a time when there was no doctrine of dual sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.778" offset="1598464">Britain didn’t have the doctrine of dual sovereignty and we say that when the United States was born, as a result of our dual sovereignty, the citizen or the denizen of the United States became amenable to both federal and state prosecutions when his activity offended the laws of both sovereigns.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.180" offset="1708074">We say that implicit in the conception of dual sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.469" offset="1749243">Now, Your Honors, if I am correct in arguing that due process is not offended by a state’s prosecution of one who has been tried in the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.109" offset="1815803">I submit that it should follow that if the State’s Attorney, as we call our state prosecuting official in Illinois, can indict and if the state courts can try the petitioner, the prosecution -- Prosecuting Attorney has the right to avail himself of the testimony of any witnesses who’s testimony is competent under the ordinary rules of evidence, that is they have knowledge of the facts, and may use any evidence that was lawfully obtained even though it was obtained by federal officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.039" offset="2051532">And we do not think that merely because federal officials bring to the attention of the state prosecuting authority, the Commission of a state act and furnish and provide him of -- with evidence of the defendant’s guilt that that constitutes a federal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.961" offset="2151215">Nor do we think that it’s like the case where federal authorities have unlawfully and unconstitutionally seized evidence and not being able to use that evidence in a federal court, try to make it available to state prosecuting officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.156" offset="2240031">We don’t think that a prosecution, not only in the name, we pay no attentions to name, conducted by the authority of state prosecuting officials, the State Prosecuting Attorney before state judges and before a state jury and in a state court constitutes a federal prosecution even if the evidence was obtained by federal officials and we submit that there was no denial of due process in those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.330" offset="2396662">Now, petitioner did not argue orally, but he does urge in his brief that it was error not to permit petitioner to show that he had been acquitted in the federal court if he could be tried at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.205" offset="2476178">We say that -- that raises at most a question of the state’s law of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.031" offset="2503450">Ordinarily, one jury isn’t told but another jury has done with a case involving the same parties and the same factual issues and we see no denial of due process in that ruling on law of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.320" offset="2580668">To sum up and conclude, we think that every utterance of this Court supports the proposition that due process is not denied by prosecution by both sovereigns for the same act offends the laws of both sovereigns and that if that the State may prosecute at all, it may use any lawfully acquired evidence to support its prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.365" offset="2720789">I will remind Your Honors again that in Palko against Connecticut, this Court held that due process does not per se inhibit second trial even by the same State if that state’s laws permit such a trial and if -- if it doesn’t appear that there is simply an intention to harass the defendant and prosecuting him time after time for the same offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.180" offset="2840116">We respectfully submit that the judgment appealed from should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="718.636" offset="2977938">It was found and settled in common law involved in more than one case, and in the Hutchinson case, which we cite in our brief particularly that murder -- the man had been convicted of murder in Portugal, he could not be tried over -- he’d been acquitted -- acquitted of murder in Portugal, he could not be tried over again in England.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.357" offset="3060799">Thus it -- thus it was established that -- that the common law -- due process of law at common law meant that the policy of Portugal was not sufficiently separate in a crime like murder where the gist and gravamen of the offense is the same under Portuguese law as under English law is -- is therefore settled that due process did -- did prevent the man being tried over again in England for that same offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="775.672" offset="3206040">There would have to be of course concurrent jurisdiction Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.500" offset="3217324">We only get this difficulty at all in these narrow classic cases where there is concurrent jurisdiction, a case -- kind of a case where I suppose if somebody shipped poison candy from one jurisdiction to the other, I suppose the murder would be committed in both cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.661" offset="3274062">I think it’s on the high seas as I recall the case that it will show -- it will show there.</text>

            <text syncTime="990.073" offset="4063692">And that is the Fox against Ohio and Moore against Illinois, and Herbert against Louisiana that Mr. Wine’s mentioned are -- are not double jeopardy cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1004.951" offset="4123146">And all these cases were cite -- and that’s how this confusion arose originally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.727" offset="4142268">They all recite the definite doctrine that Mr. Wine has pronounced that in the American system of concurrent jurisdiction, both the state and the nation can prosecute until the field has been taken over by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.135" offset="4195871">They both can prosecute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.560" offset="4201618">They both can try the man.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.767" offset="4206425">This said over and over again and those expressions have led some people to believe the additional fact -- this does not follow at all that after one jurisdiction has completed it’s proceeding, has acquitted the man that then the other one can start in and then try him over again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.383" offset="4276955">That is not necessary, and it is not been held ever in any case except in the conviction case of Lanza by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.196" offset="4308198">That’s the only case, that was the conviction case and that case is separate as I argued yesterday.</text>
