            <label>Mr. J. R. Goldthwaite, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="34.762" offset="138971">Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors, last night the hotel some of my brethren who were admitted to the Court yesterday were teasing me about having a dubious distinction of having been admitted to practice in a sport coat.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.308" offset="197172">I was afraid that in as much they noticed my improper tie that some member of the Court might have.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.498" offset="229982">And I wanted to assure the Court that it was not the lack of respect but for lack of anything else at the time to wear and lack of capacity on my suitcase.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.060" offset="272196">This case is here on certiorari to the Supreme Court of Alabama to review a judgment in the amount of $10,000 awarded to Paul Russell for alleged interference with his right to work during and admittedly lawful strike in an industry affecting interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.975" offset="383896">The phrase therefore raises a question concerning the extent of preemption on the field of interstate commerce by the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.831" offset="447321">The -- I will refer, if I may to the petitioners who are the United Automobile Workers and Michael Volk, a business representative for the union as the union and to the respondent and plaintiff below as Russell.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.491" offset="529868">The union was certified as the bargaining representative for all hourly paid employees of the Calumet and Hecla Consolidated Copper Company plant in Decatur, Alabama in early 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.576" offset="594233">After approximately ten weeks of fruitless negotiations to procure a collective bargaining agreement, on July the 17th, 1951, the employees and the union voted to go on strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.085" offset="664242">The strike began the following morning, July the 18th and beginning on that morning until August the 22nd, a period of approximately five weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.510" offset="713979">The -- Russell was out of work because the plant was closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.436" offset="745744">Almost a year later, approximately, the first of July, I don't remember the exact date, Russell and 29 other individuals whom he had solicited filed damage suits against the union alleging that the union had represented the employees, and if they had call the strike at the Calumet and Hecla Consolidated Copper Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.852" offset="859324">And in order to make the strike effective, they had established a picket line on the public street where it entered the employer's premises and by mass picketing and threats of violence had interfered with his right to work during the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.513" offset="946051">The trial court, upon motion or plea of the union, dismissed the plaintiff's petition, Russell's petition, quoting that the subject matter of the action that is the rights of employees to work during a strike and the rights of other employees to participate in a strike and concerted activity and in picketing were matters which had been granted by Congress to the exclusive prudence of the National Liberations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.885" offset="1087530">Russell appealed to the Alabama Supreme Court, this was in 1952, and the Alabama Supreme Court reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.482" offset="1133923">That is not the judgment here being reviewed but their decision was upheld in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.525" offset="1154090">And in that case, they held among other things that they didn't think that the National Labor Relations Board had authority to award, affirmatively relief in the form of back pay to an employee and that they thought the question ought to be decided by this Court before it said that the jurisdiction of a state had been so drastically succeeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.396" offset="1273522">They also held and I think this of much importance that the action in the trial court was not an action to seek the exercise of the police power of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.682" offset="1338723">They recognize that an individual's action for redress for interference with his right to work was not an exercise of the police power of the state but was an exercise of the state's judicial power.</text>

            <text syncTime="1145.930" offset="4583654">Yes, sir, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.116" offset="4600372">Briefly, the facts which illustrate this point that federal rights granted to the custody of the National Labor Relations Board were adjudicated were that on July the 17th, approximately 400 out of 550 hourly paid employees voted to go on strike the next day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.292" offset="4725133">Immediately, after they had voted to go on strike, a committee of the employees went to the company's bargaining committee and advised them that there had been a strike vote and offered to furnish hourly paid employees to work during the strike, in order to maintain the company plant and equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.298" offset="4829100">Now, that offer was declined by the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.755" offset="4846968">Now, we mentioned that because we think that is an indication along with some other factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.396" offset="4865567">I'll briefly mention that the company voluntarily elected not to try to operate the plant during the strike, and it throws a light on whether or not federal rights were adjudicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.458" offset="4917812">They said that they had supervisor employees who could attend to the plant maintenance during the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.517" offset="4949995">Another indication that the company decided to close down was at 7:30 on the morning the strike began, the company began to close down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.136" offset="5008509">They began to discharge copper out of the furniture of the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.308" offset="5029198">A procedure which normally was done only when the company was preparing to close down and mind you this was 30 minutes before the next shift of employees was due to come on work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.141" offset="5080503">In other words, they began to close down before they knew whether an employee -- employees were going to come in on the next shift or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.711" offset="5118746">One of the foreman Mr. Bevis testified that he advised some of his employees that the company was not going to operate during the strike and that he did that because he had been advised by top management of -- that the company was not going to operate because of an agreement between the company and the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.819" offset="5219265">And the agreement was the meeting on the afternoon of July 17th when the company declined the offer of supervisory employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.390" offset="5265554">There were other indications which I mentioned in the brief that the company didn't intend to operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.965" offset="5291781">Mr. Russell, just before 8 o'clock on the morning of July 18th, approached the picket line and as he came up, one of the employee says, “Paul, the plant is on strike and there is no any work today” or words to that effect, and he replied, “Go to hell” which shows he is animus, I think toward the union activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.419" offset="5401600">He then drove on down this was about 200 yards from the picket line, he drove going down to the picket line which had been established at the end of a public street where it entered the plant premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.720" offset="5454785">In other words, it was established at a dead end of plant -- of public property at the edge of the plant property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.954" offset="5487804">There were about 300 employees there picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.566" offset="5514240">They were there having been instructed to come down so that picket schedules could be organized and I assume in the interest of their personal interest in the strike as they had a constitutional right to assemble peaceably.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.217" offset="5580800">He came to the picket line and the picket line did not open for him to take his automobile through, although it was opening for supervisory employees to go through.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.559" offset="5638165">As one -- as a bus started through, Mr. Russell tried to follow the bus through the picket line, and when he did -- when he did try to follow it through the picket line, closed back in front of him and someone shouted, “Turn him over.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.471" offset="5701799">Someone else shouted “Shut up” so he stopped and sat there about an hour and a half.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.118" offset="5736385">The picket line didn't open and he turned around and left.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.654" offset="5750596">And he testified himself nobody touched him, nobody touched his automobile or harmed his automobile, some of them leaned on it, there was no damage to him personally or damage to his property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.970" offset="5807856">There was no actual violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.362" offset="5817365">Nobody was arrested on that occasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.486" offset="5833874">There was no -- no actual violence on that occasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.502" offset="5849966">So he left, and immediately began a back to work movement, began circulating petitions which were addressed to the company saying, “If the company will reopen the gates to the people, we will cross the picket line and return to work,” which we think is an indication that they knew the company had closed the plant down, because of by the wording on the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.046" offset="5956127">After starting the petition, he went to see his attorney, Mr. Harris and advised Mr. Harris according to his own testimony that it would take the company from 200 to 250 employees to operate the plant, because the plant was a highly integrated continuous processing operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.948" offset="6047765">So Mr. Harris advised him, according to his testimony, well had have to get many people to sign a petition before the company would agree to reopen, and they send him out to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.977" offset="6091860">And in suing five weeks, he was successful along with other employees in getting about 240 signatures to a petition which was worded and prepared by Mr. Harris, to the effect that if the company will reopen the plant, we will resume work on the same terms and conditions of work as existed at the time the work stoppage began.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.616" offset="6198439">Now that petition together with a letter from Mr. Harris was delivered to the company just about August the 20th.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.712" offset="6230831">With the letter explained to the company in substance, National Labor Relations Board decisions to the effect that the company had a legal right to hire employees and reopen the plant even though other employees continue to strike and picket.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.545" offset="6302093">So during this period of five weeks, Mr. Russell didn't go down to the picket line except on two occasions, he went down too see what was going on, see whether the pickets were still there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.101" offset="6352353">He didn't go down or making an attempt to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.364" offset="6377430">He said that he assumed there was no work and didn't contact the company to see if there was any work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.825" offset="6407210">During this period of five weeks from July the 18th until August the 20th, the company showed not the first intention to want to operate the plant by any action whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.388" offset="6473456">They didn't procure an injunction, they didn't attempt to bring in any materials, they didn't attempt to have anybody arrested, no one was arrested not until they got this petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.080" offset="6524238">They didn't do a thing to indicate any wish to -- for the hourly employees to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.001" offset="6563944">Now, and as I say, there had been absolutely no actual violence up to that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.701" offset="6586723">Immediately, upon receiving the back to work petition, the company advised all employees by newspaper ad and by letter, that the plant would reopen on August 22nd and they were urged to come back to work at 8 o'clock, all employees and they would be reassigned later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.341" offset="6661329">On August the 28th, preparatory to opening and this was after they had gotten the back to work petition, they sent a dinky locomotive out of the picket line to bring in five railroad columns of copper which had been left to the picket line by the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.054" offset="6740114">When they did, the picket line moved from the street over on to the railroad track and obstruct its progress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.603" offset="6762371">The police were there and determined that there would be a violence if they try to bring in the columns of copper so they started back with the train and found that the tracks had been braced and the -- ignition wires and distributive head on the dinky engine had been removed and air hoses removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.462" offset="6841783">That actually was the only actual violence up throughout the entire period of the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.147" offset="6872503">Now, not a single representative of the union was present on that occasion and neither was Mr. Russell was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.114" offset="6896431">We object to the introduction of that evidence because we said there had no indication or no tendency to show any damage to him which it accrue as a result of the plant closing down and shared no light on why the plant closed down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.764" offset="6950975">But it was admitted on the theory that it might show intention on our part to engage in violence if it had been necessary on July the 18th.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.756" offset="7003011">So he returned to work on August the 22nd after five weeks.</text>

            <text syncTime="1994.416" offset="7977587">Now, prior to the Taft-Hartley Act, Your Honors, there was no attempt made by the National Labor Relations Act to regulate conduct on the part of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.549" offset="8026175">But in 1947 in customs to public demands that unions be made responsible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.253" offset="8064940">The Congress amended the National Labor Relations Act by enacting the Taft-Hartley Act and there were several changes among the most material here are the amendment to Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.100" offset="8116349">Prior to Section -- to 1947, Section 7 had provided that employees shall have the right to engage any concerted activity, and that's about the substance of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.047" offset="8164101">That was the only guarantee that employees shall have the right to engage in concerted activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.878" offset="8187507">The 1947 Act, however, added before the right that employees shall also have the right to refrain from any such activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.804" offset="8231184">Now, that was construed by this Court and in accordance with the statements of Congress, that is employees are guaranteed by the National Labor Relations Act the right to work in the face of a strike if they so desire.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.978" offset="8295863">In order to implement that guarantee, Congress amended Section 8 by adding Section 8 (b) which defined unfair labor practices on the part of unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.795" offset="8351138">Among which were interference with the right of employes to engage in Section 7 guarantees, so interference to the Section 7 guarantee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.695" offset="8390740">And of course discrimination in employment and secondary boycotts in 8 (b) (4) and jurisdictional strikes and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.882" offset="8443507">And to implement that they gave the Board of course a continued authority under Section 10 (c) to remedy unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.018" offset="8504007">In explaining the purpose of the amendments in Section 1 of the Labor Management Relations Act which is 29 U.S.C. 141, the Congress said, “It is the purpose and policy of this Act in order to promote the full flow of commerce to prescribe the legitimate rights of both employees and employers and their relations affecting commerce to provide orderly and peaceful procedures for preventing the interference by either with the legitimate rights of the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.590" offset="8662309">To protect the individual rights -- the rights of the individual employees and their relations with labor organizations who activities affect commerce, to define and prescribe practices on the part of labor and management which affect commerce and economical to the general welfare and protect the rights of the public in the connection with labor disputes affecting commerce.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.268" offset="8765022">Now that declaration of purpose in the light of the congressional history in Section 7 and Section 8 induced this Court in the bus driver's case to say that Congress and the Labor Management Relations Act and the amended Act had regulated and defined the rights of employees and had protected the right of employees to work during a strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.373" offset="8881424">And he said it is clear that when Congress took those rights in hand by the National Labor Relation -- by Section 7 that the states could not exercise any jurisdiction over Section 7 guarantee.</text>
