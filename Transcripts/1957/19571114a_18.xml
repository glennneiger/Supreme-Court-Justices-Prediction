            <text syncTime="180.753" offset="722965">I'd like to suggest that this is -- would require not only overruling Allegheny and Kern-Limerick, but if they're correct if we are correct, the United States owned this property.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.213" offset="776777">Their position would require overruling 100 years of cases saying that property of the United States is not subject to a personal property ad valorem tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.547" offset="814184">We think that Congress which has legislated in this field for 100 years based on the assumption that Government-owned property is not subject to a personal property tax, should make any changes of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.363" offset="861414">Congress had the power and it would be a -- upsetting ruling to reverse the 100 years of decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.283" offset="893074">The third argument is that the United States Executive Branch has no authority to acquire material or semi completed goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.296" offset="941140">They argue that the executive branch does not have -- it's prevented by the revised statute which they cite, requiring material or goods that are not completed items.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.317" offset="981264">We believe this argument is wholly without merits, that their argument really turns on their conclusion that the United States did not own the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.410" offset="1017626">They say this is an advanced -- and advanced payments are prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.959" offset="1035807">If the United States actually acquired all the own -- incidents of ownership, the bulk of the bundle of rights in this property, their argument would be if United States cannot buy materials which is clearly wrong, that we cannot buy uncompleted items has been well settled since Ansonia where the United States bought a vessel in the process of completion making payments of 10%, 20% and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.942" offset="1139670">But the vessel throughout the stage belonged to the United States at least as against a lien of any state property supplier.</text>

            <text syncTime="346.260" offset="1385012">These are cases, the first one where United States sold property, homes to buyers.</text>

            <text syncTime="359.307" offset="1437153">The United States wrongly refused to convey the title after the payments were made.</text>

            <text syncTime="368.216" offset="1472784">This Court held that the owners, the buyers of that property were the equitable owners and that even though the United States held the legal title because it has refused to convey a deed, the property was subject to tax since all the possessory rights, everything was in the purchasers except the United States' legal title.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.179" offset="1564630">In S.R.A. against -- Incorporated against Minnesota in 327 U.S., a similar situation existed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1141.202" offset="4564741">Appellants state in their brief, how this clause operates which is unfortunately incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.695" offset="4610717">They say, "But the provision of this contract permits the Government title -- I'm reading from page 64, appellants' brief -- "Permits the Government title to revest in the contractor or subcontractor as soon as the Government has been delivered goods equivalent to the value of its investment therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.655" offset="4690547">This assumes that deliveries under the contract are applied first to the partial payments."</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.076" offset="4716251">So that if, that the example I gave on page 65 with partial payments were equal to 20 -- a quarter of the total contract price and as soon as goods have been delivered to a quarter of the price, they contend that the title would revest back or vest -- would go with vest into the Murray Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.190" offset="4792738">And that is one of the major things upon which they rely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.085" offset="4804336">It comes from a misreading of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.870" offset="4819383">The clause controlling this appears on page 175 of the record, it is subparagraph (c), immediately preceding subparagraph (d).</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.233" offset="4876852">In making payments for the second payment for the supplies furnished hereunder, there shall be deducted from the contract price therefore, a proportionate amount of the partial payments theretofore made to the contractor under the authority herein contained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.360" offset="4953339">A proportionate amount, so that if we have paid 25% of the -- if by partial payments, we have paid 25% of the contract price for the finished items, that he should deliver 25% or deliver a certain portion of the -- a number of items being delivered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.993" offset="5043931">The partial payments would be reduced in proportion so we would still have a partial payment of 25% outstanding on the balance of the property and it would not revest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.533" offset="5086041">The only way that -- that the -- the only way the Murray Corporation can get title back is upon completing the contract, delivering every item which it is -- which is provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.231" offset="5148839">He then gets title to the scraps, the remnants and the jigs or consumable tools which are worth nothing by hypothesis.</text>

            <label>Mr. Hobart Taylor, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="2109.316" offset="8437238">Thank you very much, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.321" offset="8449254">First, I should like to address myself to the remark which had just been made with respect to the Government's great desire for control over the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.581" offset="8494289">It seems to me that if partial payment are made only at the option of the contractor that the Government is not overly concern about it because this contract, that has the power to finance this contract by any private means if he so desires.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.084" offset="8560327">The cost of which would be an element of cost to him and to the Government eventually.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.714" offset="8578821">But if he chooses to take money from the Government rather from his bank then this so-called title comes into existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.072" offset="8612258">Now, the Government obviously could not be so concerned about having control over the goods as my brother indicates, otherwise, that would not be this option on the part of the contractor whether the Government would provide that the moment that materials were required for the purpose of the contract title would vest in the Government and no parts of him should be required at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.315" offset="8705254">So, it seems to me that what we actually have here is a security arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.704" offset="8734720">Now, I would like to say one or two more things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.945" offset="8747677">Yesterday the impression may have been given that this was some type of peculiar, an unusual personal property tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.999" offset="8791980">We don't think that that is so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.478" offset="8801907">I think that what my brother meant yesterday was and as he explained it to me or is it he was drawing a distinction between the tax in this case and the tax been allegating, but this is an ad valorem personal property tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.818" offset="8859272">I should say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.290" offset="8873064">Our research in this matter has tended to indicate that perhaps Allegheny should be reconsidered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.045" offset="8900127">But we do not believe that it is necessary to reconsider Allegheny or to do anything to Kern-Limerick to decide in this Court's and a title this case can be decided on whether or not the Government had title to the property or whether or not this was a security title or a lien as was held in (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.434" offset="8981734">But if we -- you wanted to go back to reconsider the problems that were present in Allegheny and perhaps some very broad language in Kern-Limerick as the Government can do whatever sound business practice dictates words to that effect, which is rather wavering on uncertain standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.986" offset="9055922">Why -- I think that perhaps what would not be inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.934" offset="9075670">But so far as we're concern, we have here what amounts to no more than an overreaching on the part of Government contracting officers you know no doubt to their feeling that the Congress has been somewhat penurious in their granting of moneys to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.118" offset="9144424">And an effort to further finance Government contracts at the expense of the State government because this amounts to an invasion and encroachment and to appeal which has been traditionally one on which the states could tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.042" offset="9204088">Raw materials, things or which had not been put into their finished forms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.897" offset="9223523">With respect to this particular matter, too, I think it's in order to emphasize, the partial payments are not made just on property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.004" offset="9255915">Partial payments are made on cost incurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.713" offset="9266782">And in the partial payments in these case as the stipulation shows, there were such matters including this traveling expenses, make ready cost, liaison work, all sorts of items, of course, which they allocated to this contract but which were not in fact property or anything that would give the Government any type of security or anything that they can take over.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.480" offset="9357897">And Mr. Chief Justice, I think the theories which you expressed with regard to contract is overbearing are -- are quite real because if a contract had made a mistake, let's say an over purchased property for the purpose of this contract knowing that he was nearing the completion of it and that therefore the title would revest in him and be useful for his ordinary business and affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.845" offset="9447340">If he did it, the only real remedy that the Government would exercise because as this stipulation shows also all they did was check their accounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.906" offset="9479523">That was all that was really done in reference to this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.538" offset="9494152">The only thing that would be done is that the contractor would not receive partial payments based upon the excess property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.579" offset="9526230">As a result therefore, he would still be in a position after tax day, he'd have a whole year in which he could divert upon the completion of this contract in which he could divert the property to his own uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.545" offset="9574087">And it seems like to me that this is indeed a very dangerous clause because it not only inhibits us in an area where we should be permitted to tax but it also permits evasion on other taxes.</text>
