            <text syncTime="123.535" offset="494132">Now, the next aspect of the -- of the activity is the activities in the part of the strikers on a vacant lot, strikers and representatives of the Amalgamated on a vacant lot across the street from the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.587" offset="550348">The location of the plant was on Rowena Street and Martin Drive.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.600" offset="566335">Across from Rowena Street, there was a vacant lot which the Amalgamated leaves during the strike as strike headquarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.762" offset="594965">And it was on this lot, they erected a tent, they serve meals to the pickets, pickets would wait there for their turn to take their turn at picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.071" offset="632268">And it was on this lot too, they -- on occasion, they would meet and discuss the strike and how it was going and there was a telephone there too, in event, they had telephone from the strike headquarters anywhere else.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.182" offset="688692">Now, this was the strike headquarters immediately across to the plant and it was here that we find that persons, the Amalgamated testified some four to eight would gather there normally times a few more than 10, 12, 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.115" offset="752431">The Court found that it's high as 35, as I recollect, gathered at this place.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.204" offset="772807">As high as that and ranging from 8 to 35 would gather on this vacant lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.009" offset="803944">The street, Rowena Street there was some 20 feet wide.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.122" offset="816483">There are some questions as to whether there was a ditch on both sides of the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.185" offset="828709">The record doesn't make it absolutely clear but there is at least one ditch of some 10 feet on one side of the -- on one side of Rowena Street.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.744" offset="858906">So, there's at least 30 feet separating the vacant lot and the plant premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.419" offset="877610">The plant gave itself to some 35 to 40 feet from the -- from the street and the tent itself on the vacant lot was approximately 40 to 50 feet from the -- from the lot line.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.990" offset="935915">It was here that the strikers would gather and if -- if this conduct that particularly challenged by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.531" offset="970083">The strikers would gather there and they would -- they would sing the songs that are traditional to the picket line.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.622" offset="1010416">These songs are the -- one of the songs to which the Court made reference, it was “When the Saints Come Marching In” was changed to “When the Scabs Come Marching In.”</text>
            <text syncTime="261.754" offset="1046988">This is normal with picket lines normally, as we -- we point out in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.999" offset="1075931">It's to take songs which are religious songs and which groups can sing on the favor, appealing and to convert them into union song.</text>

            <text syncTime="363.565" offset="1454184">And what -- but if we come though, as we come to the question here, you'll see that the court -- the court below does not rely on the so-called incidence of violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.888" offset="1495458">The court below pays rather special and careful attention to the picket line activity as described on the vacant lot to wit the singing and the calling to the strike breakers as they enter the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.091" offset="1556271">The court particularly, the court below particularly states -- I'm -- I'm reading on page 202 of the record and the first complete paragraph, “It is true that an injunction prohibiting all picketing may not be based on isolated and episodic acts of violence or other unlawful conduct.”</text>
            <text syncTime="406.293" offset="1625130">Even if it would be conceded that the acts of violence involved here, fall in that category and they then proceed to go on into the, a holding which I read to the Court in the beginning of my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.678" offset="1674658">So, the Court doesn't rely on these so-called acts of violence, to which I will come in a moment to this so-called acts of violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.487" offset="1705900">They relied particularly and principally on the strikers calling across the street to the strike breakers as they entered and left the plant that they were scabs and variations of that word.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.118" offset="1752398">And as to the songs, they mentioned the fact, there were this song -- there was this song that I've just referred to when the scabs go marching in and also, they took the song “Davy Crockett” and -- and utilized it there to the striker's purpose -- to the striker's purpose thereto and we have the -- we have the language of that in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.888" offset="1827527">Now, the thing that the Court drew particular attention to and which throughout the trial of the case was the main thing was that it -- as the people would come in and go out of the plant, these persons, numbering from 8 to 37 in terms of the Court and we don't ask this Court to go behind that finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.606" offset="1894400">Numbering somewhere between 8 to 37 would stand and would -- would shout to the strike breakers as they would walk in.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.566" offset="1938181">They would -- they would as the court below found, used such terms as “fat scabs,” “yellow scabs,” “pony tailed scabs,” “crazy scabs,” “cotton patch scabs,” and “fuzzy headed scabs.”</text>
            <text syncTime="495.962" offset="1983843">On a few occasions, the court below noted, the strikers were referred to as “fools,” or “cotton picking fools.”</text>
            <text syncTime="502.135" offset="2008503">These were relevantly few occasions as the Court makes perfectly claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.962" offset="2027833">So, we come down then to using these word “scab.”</text>
            <text syncTime="511.054" offset="2044134">I assume that this is a qualifying adjective which drew the attention or ire of the Court and brought down this injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.340" offset="2077257">Presumably, it's the one word, that word is “scab.”</text>
            <text syncTime="523.985" offset="2095856">Now, nowhere in the Court's findings is there any indication, if there's any obscenity, there's no profanity, no rudeness of any kind, must be remembered also, as I've stated at the very outset, they were women talking with women.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.230" offset="2164820">The -- there's no real question here -- there's no real question here of any fear on the part of any of the strike breakers.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.563" offset="2202227">And as a matter of fact, a careful reading of the record as demonstrated that as far as any of the employees who walked across that picket line, day in and day out for these four days that not one of them testified that they're reporting fear of physical safety, not one.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.742" offset="2282893">The only evidence along those lines comes from the plant manager without any support whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.327" offset="2309224">But not one of the employees stated that she was put in fear of physical safety by the women across the street shouted at them.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.758" offset="2342975">Now, throughout the strike, throughout these four days, all of these strike breakers continued to walk in and out of that plant just as they customarily did.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.924" offset="2379651">They came down to Rowena Street, which is the street on which the vacant lot is located where they could have used Martin Drive have they had any feeling there, as they have any feeling that they were disturbed about coming into that plant but they did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.938" offset="2431687">They came to -- where they normally came and it was down Rowena Street they would come across the -- as they came down to Rowena Street, they would turn over a ditch and park with their -- the front end of their car right at the building line of the plant there.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.310" offset="2497202">They would leave their cars, in other words, on Rowena Street right across to where the strikers were located, no fear whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.625" offset="2526459">As a matter of fact, during the lunch hour, they would go out and they will have their lunch at the -- at the street there and that there's no violence here.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.247" offset="2564911">That there was no violence whatsoever in connection to this picket line or with the activities on this vacant lot as demonstrated from the plant manager's testimony at the trial and also from testimony of the Chief of Police, who said that he had been there everyday, he would go down there everyday to see what was going on and never an arrest, never attempted an arrest and his testimony is.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.959" offset="2655817">Now Chief -- I'm reading from page 14 of our brief and it's 153 in the record, that this particular question and answer took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.547" offset="2694165">He said, “Now, chief, you don't know of any actual violence having occurred down there, do you?</text>
            <text syncTime="677.576" offset="2710256">Do you know any?”</text>
            <text syncTime="679.062" offset="2716212">And the answer is “No, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.437" offset="2721646">We have none.”</text>
            <text syncTime="681.849" offset="2727393">This is the Chief of Police of Wynne.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.841" offset="2739304">As to the plant manager and this is also on page 14 of our brief, 126 in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.258" offset="2768980">Now, Mr. Bonady, when the picket line was thrown up the second time, do you know of any actual incidents of violence that have occurred out there in connection with the picket line?</text>
            <text syncTime="700.778" offset="2803043">You are talking about physical violence?”</text>
            <text syncTime="702.945" offset="2811716">That's the answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.944" offset="2815687">“Is that what you call violence?”</text>
            <text syncTime="705.714" offset="2822792">Question.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.238" offset="2824882">“Yes, physical violence.”</text>
            <text syncTime="707.422" offset="2829688">Answer, “I've never observed anybody.”</text>
            <text syncTime="711.509" offset="2845989">Now, this comes from the principal witness in behalf of the company, the plant manager and on behalf of the Chief Police Officer of the community in which the strike took place.</text>

            <text syncTime="757.338" offset="3029264">Now, on the -- still talking in terms of the -- of the picket line, every precaution was taken on the part of the -- of the representatives of the Amalgamated to avoid any violence because they did, they were quite conscious of the fact that they were in an area where an injunction might very well -- might very well issue and they did not -- they want to be perfectly playing that there would not be anything that could smack a violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.553" offset="3130201">As a matter of fact, on several instances, one of the representatives of the Amalgamated asked the Chief of Police to be sure and be there just to check up, so that the event, if his testimony wherever necessary to any proceeding, he could tell that there was no violence whatsoever in connection to this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.822" offset="3191223">And as a matter of fact, the Chief of Police did testify, although as a company witness that there was none.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.317" offset="3213166">There was also an instruction by sign.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.476" offset="3221838">It was posted on the -- on the vacant lot which was used as strike headquarters to the effect that there'd be no violence and they meant this completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.629" offset="3254439">They meant this officially and unofficially that there would be no violence whatsoever or any threat.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.970" offset="3275860">Now, in addition to Court refers still -- if I may, on the picket line activities themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.664" offset="3302609">They refer to two incidents, and one of these incidents is that the two other women strikers make fun of the pregnancy of a strike breaker.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.903" offset="3347540">This could take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.261" offset="3352973">Two of the women strikers did judge a -- one of the strike breakers on the fact she was pregnant.She said later -- she said, “I thought I was friend of -- I thought they were friends of mine before this thing all began but nevertheless, this is what they did.”</text>
            <text syncTime="852.287" offset="3409084">She did not feel intimidated about it and she felt -- she felt somewhat hurt that they -- these friends of hers would do this kind of a thing during this particular period.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.502" offset="3445969">Another one of the women on which the Court placed a very heavy reliant, is the fact that one of the women, they judge with one of the women about the fact that she had a low-cut dress and she wore a big earring.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.142" offset="3492467">The Court felt that this woman felt very angry as the result of this and that she felt it's necessary to work because she had children to support and she took very unkindly to this -- to this comment that is made to her, she walked in and out of the picket line.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.016" offset="3552026">The fact of the matter is though and I think it is some significance to show the lengths to which this Court went to support this all embracing injunction and how little -- how little there really is in this record of anything other than what I have related up to now.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.784" offset="3615033">And that is -- that is the -- the testimony of a particular employee in question that appears at pages 13 and 14 of our brief at 146 and 147 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.392" offset="3673548">The question, “Would you--” this is on -- on direct-examination by Mr. Shaver, who was counsel for the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.423" offset="3697685">“Could you please tell the Court what they called you?”</text>
            <text syncTime="926.843" offset="3707298">“Well, one afternoon I left as I've started to leave the plant when I got off and I was walking by the warehouse and my friends always parks their car in the Martin side Drive and I was going around and Louis Morrison, one of the strikers hollered, “Oh, look.Look there at that low-cut dress and big earring girl” and the speech referring to the manager of the plant, the speech “still like low-cut dresses and earrings and I said, “I don't know, you will have to ask him”.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.180" offset="3816699">And she said, “If he does, I think I would get me one” and I said, “It won't do you any good, you don't have anything to fill it up.”</text>
            <text syncTime="964.279" offset="3857032">Now, the Court -- the Court felt this woman was very -- very angry and this is one of the -- this is one of the main incidents outside of the calling of -- of scab on which they play such very heavy reliance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1544.088" offset="6176287">At the outset, may it please the Court, the -- I've gotten seriously whether we would be the termed strike breakers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.222" offset="6212859">That puts us on defensive to be a strike breaker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.981" offset="6239922">I'd like to drop that in because we were working at the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.638" offset="6254550">These employees were working at the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.437" offset="6265731">They had the right to work at the plant and they wanted to continue to work at the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.338" offset="6289345">49 people went out on strike and when they went out on strike, the rest of them did not go out on strike but continued to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.104" offset="6344411">So, as to whether we are strike breakers are not under Arkansas law or scabs or whatever, the union which is to call us, we say that we are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.738" offset="6394880">Now, the case to -- to us seems simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.858" offset="6423406">Rainfair Incorporated manufacture slacks and they have been in a little town of Wynne where I was born and raised and I like it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.586" offset="6466247">And there are 107 employees, the people of Wynne are trying to get in the industry and they donated and put up money and got industry, got the one little plant there to manufacture slacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.206" offset="6544823">Well, on the week ending before May 2nd, I believe on Monday, May 2nd, on Saturday or Friday, everybody was happy and quit work and on Monday, when the management got there, there's a picket line around the plant in about 10 o'clock and 11 o'clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.085" offset="6644297">The union warns management that a strike was going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.883" offset="6679510">Now, 29 of the employees struck and they picketed there for I'd say two weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.916" offset="6715664">I -- I believe, I'm correct on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.805" offset="6727158">Nobody -- May the 19th, they quit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.280" offset="6741055">Now, doing that picket line, they didn't do very much damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.907" offset="6767595">They threatened to whip the manager, Mr. Bonady said he's a northerner came from Wisconsin and that he was going to run back to Wisconsin and wipe up the conflict with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.088" offset="6836349">Around the plant is parking places for cars, there was nails found strewn all of over parking area one morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.244" offset="6884937">And those, as I've said found strewn on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.232" offset="6908865">And another time, there was a cart of roof intact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.259" offset="6933002">Beautiful shining roof intact, it was thrown in Mr. Bonady's driveway and in the driveway of the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.173" offset="6984620">And they were no -- I say, they were found that the next morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.313" offset="7013251">But with all of that, there was -- there's nothing that was done about the picket line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.814" offset="7047210">On the 19th, the union warned that they were sending back this 29 employees or they notified mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.686" offset="7102694">When the -- I forgot to tell you this, when the 29 refused to report for work Monday morning, management wrote them a letter and asked them to come back and said, “if you don't come back, we presume that you do not want to be an employee” and I think three came back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.574" offset="7194227">Now, when these other employees came back to work, the management didn't take them, they employed 13 additional people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.532" offset="7238113">And then it brought their own until about June 20th and they had the meeting down at Forrest City, Arkansas and what happened at that time was simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.440" offset="7297672">They voted to go on a strike and I believe it was started, I think, I say the picket line was started in the middle of the night.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.982" offset="7343856">Now, if you would listen here to Mr. Isaacson, you would think that with this woman that was pregnant and the snake in this garden -- you'd think that we're in the Garden of Eden when he talks about what happened but the picket line started at 12:30 at night because two of the strikers who didn't did like Mrs. Newby who was a worker, drove up in front of her house and Mrs. Newby lived in a trailer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.788" offset="7479066">And Mrs. Newby wasn't asleep.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.096" offset="7492336">She had a daughter stay in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.801" offset="7507174">So these two strikers had been going back and forth on Rowena Street which runs north and south in a little town and the plants on the west side and Mrs. Newby's trailer is on the east side of Rowena and just north to the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.223" offset="7588885">That was her home and she will sleep there and she had gone down and wasn't asleep, she was leaning down and all of a sudden, she stepped out and two of these strikers, I believe Roberts and someone I don't know, punctured two of the tires of other one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.945" offset="7671745">A punctured toward the tires of the automobile that Mrs. Newby's daughter owned and was parked in front of her home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.773" offset="7707063">She immediately got up and called the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.622" offset="7718452">The law arrested them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.478" offset="7721900">They went down and try them and was convicted and fined and that's undisputed in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.292" offset="7753143">Well, about 5:30 or 6 o'clock, the law was called again and one of the windows of the plant was knocked out and there was a five foot black snake laying closed to the broken window.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.405" offset="7817613">And the city marshal down there (Inaudible) he goes own and he captured the snake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.786" offset="7847079">So, we've got -- we've got a snake in the plant at 5:30 in the morning and we've got these two strikers operating at 12:30 that night.</text>

            <text syncTime="2003.005" offset="8011964">And right over here was the lot, they put a tent and three benches and some chairs, and that was the focal point for the -- what the union folks called “picketing activity.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.642" offset="8066508">And that was a place that all the trouble start.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.114" offset="8080405">Now, they said that they just walk up and down the street out there and having a picket and add something on it -- some kind of a sign on it but that didn't work out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.256" offset="8136934">Now, what -- what really happened out there, when the picketing was resumed then usually one or two pickets would walk and carry signs up and down Rowena Street.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.094" offset="8196284">Other union staff members strike as they sympathizes would assemble under and around the tent in groups estimated at different time from 8 to 37.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.146" offset="8268487">It was a focal point of all these picketing and the headquarters for the concerted action will be the name calling, singing or jeering.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.039" offset="8316134">As the employees would go to and from work at the plant, or go to lunch, or take a recess, this was a persistent thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.902" offset="8347585">This was a combination of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.936" offset="8371722">The strikers would contemplate along the west edge of their lot and sometimes in Rowena Street engaged in loud and offensive name calling, singing, and shouting directly at the workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.855" offset="8419370">Now, what did they do?</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.245" offset="8440895">This group fair would insult these workers and when we were asked -- when Mr. Youngdahl, Mr. Becker and the other gentleman that represent the union was asked “Why did you insult them?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.311" offset="8517172">“Oh, was that insulting them?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.484" offset="8525845">”Yes, it was insulting them.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.634" offset="8534518">“Do you mean calling them those names was an insult?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.553" offset="8550191">“Yes, that was an insult.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.127" offset="8556460">“Do you think you could persuade people by insulting them?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.665" offset="8578612">“No, I don't think we could.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.407" offset="8597525">Now, the question here with reference to the meaning of scab right there, I say, that question is outside of this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.640" offset="8642560">Now, when the people themselves who used the word and who construed it to be an insult and who said that if they had been called those names, they would have been insulted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.008" offset="8695954">I don't see why we have to go to Webster or Merriam or Greenway, or any of these people that defines the meaning of various words.</text>

            <text syncTime="2326.518" offset="9306070">In other words, aren't we weighing and equating here just enough in this little Rowena Street strike, the question of the right to work, the police filed a state, the criminal laws of the state, the right to strike.</text>

            <text syncTime="2403.949" offset="9615778">And I'm coming to make another payment on the baby, call doctor beat” and here last week, I went to the doctor and one day they said, “well, you can work another hour until you go into the delivery room.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2424.277" offset="9697071">And when I came back, they asked me, “Did I go on a false alarm.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.154" offset="9716611">Yes, conditions like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.062" offset="9732180">There's the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.014" offset="9736046">Does the Fourteenth Amendment -- does the Fourteenth Amendment deal to anybody that wants to strike, a constitutional right to insult a woman because she has to work and carrying a baby?</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.293" offset="9837087">Now, let's see what they said about it.This is their construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.454" offset="9877734">On page 58 of the brief, when taken place between women, either who have grown up together in a rural community, who have attended the same school, and who now attend the same church, they appear to be little more than good natured man.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.024" offset="10000091">In this category or the jocular remarks addressed to one of the women who was pregnant, and another whose dress was cut somewhat revealingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.238" offset="10088908">They not only called those workers persistently, call them “fools”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.056" offset="10120150">Is any -- does that convey any idea?</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.632" offset="10130495">Is there something society gets out to call a man a fool?</text>

            <text syncTime="2538.734" offset="10154841">I -- I think it's an insult.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.589" offset="10174276">They call them “yellow scabs”, “cotton patch scabs.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.213" offset="10200816">Now, who did all these?</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.797" offset="10211161">Mr. Youngdahl, Mr. Becker, and I can't recall the other man and the two other staff members who were Ruth Kimsey (ph) and (Inaudible) that was the staff there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.740" offset="10294857">They did this thing persistently and continuing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.116" offset="10312411">There is one -- one instance -- let's take this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.142" offset="10332473">Perhaps it shows what they did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.200" offset="10340728">Two of those young ladies left in the car and went downtown to get some gasoline and two of the strikers drove up and said, “Don't wait on them.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.710" offset="10374792">The filling station man says, “Who got here first?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.657" offset="10398616">And he said, “Don't wait on them because they are scabs.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.149" offset="10432575">Now that happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.375" offset="10437486">Now, what did they do to the manager?</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.614" offset="10450442">Well, the manager would leave and go to town or go to different places and they followed him in the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.728" offset="10478864">They just -- the strikers would follow him and they'd go where he went and just followed him and escorted him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.744" offset="10502896">They say, “That's not intimidation”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.633" offset="10514495">“I guess the man has got a right to drive his car downtown without being followed”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.078" offset="10532258">I don't know whether he has not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.672" offset="10542602">Now, what did they do to his home at night, the phone would ring, they add on party lines out there, like 61F and so forth and then you -- everybody rings on the party line and he answers and he can't find out who's calling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.245" offset="10620970">So, it continues to ring until 12 o'clock at night and finally he has to have it shut off and that -- and that's what happened in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.187" offset="10660676">So these things continued on to four days until we got the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.681" offset="10682723">Now, something has been said about this one snake in the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.834" offset="10739252">During the trial of the lawsuit, there was a lot of glass found, strewn all over the parking lot and during that trial they didn't -- the Court didn't like it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.073" offset="10812291">They had issued the temporary injunction and on its motion, the Court turned the glass over to the sheriff and asked the sheriff to find out who did it or the city marshal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.891" offset="10867461">And they found out that two boys did it and he cited the boys and their parents to show cause, why they shouldn't be adjudged and contempt to Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.311" offset="10933185">During that hearing, the -- one of the called boys said, the reason he did it, he just didn't like Mrs. Newby.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.520" offset="10970070">She was a worker and she was -- she was -- they didn't want to have anything to do with Mrs. Newby.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.479" offset="11001835">The other boy said he didn't know why he did it but there's a good friend of mine, we know everybody down there in my town.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.196" offset="11040705">I know all these person and I know Lee Hamrick was one of the boy's father and Lee had been a striker in the first strike and had a home right there where Ms. Newby's home was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.635" offset="11114475">So, Lee got up to testify because he -- he was cited for contempt and just before he got out off the stand, I asked him this questions and I'm reading from 189 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.084" offset="11696274">Question.</text>

            <text syncTime="2979.764" offset="11919047">But anyway, we do have here the findings of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.196" offset="11936705">We have the -- of the lower court, we have the -- the recruiting of people to throw snakes in the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.284" offset="11985084">We have a snake in the plant and we have two girls sitting in the lawn one afternoon when two of the strikers went by and said, “You better shake your sheets tonight.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.724" offset="12030851">You might find some snakes in your sheet.”</text>

            <text syncTime="3015.600" offset="12062302">It was enough testimony for the lower court and it was enough testimony for the Supreme Court on -- on that one basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.733" offset="12106919">But in order to sum up as far as the facts are concerned, it would seem that the tacks, the nails, the snake, the testimony of Hamrick, the congregating, the blocking of the workers coming in and going to the plant and coming in to the highway and backing the cars out, what I call mass picketing, they call it concerted activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.197" offset="12236696">I call it as much picketing as to come out in a group and have a plan to stop people from going to work, as much picketing as it is can assign in walking down the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.517" offset="12298031">So, as far as the facts are concerned, I take it that it's still the law that the Court will forward the facts here that is defining of the state court would be supported and these cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="3310.699" offset="13242723">And it was decided in 1918 and it is a question of first impression in this State and a number of other States like this one have no cases on the subject.</text>

            <text syncTime="3347.114" offset="13388382">It quotes here from a Georgia Court, in discussing a similar question, the Supreme Court of Georgia said that the conduct which operates upon ones fear rather that upon his judgment or his sympathy is coercive, crowd is naturally collect, disturbances of the peace always eminent.</text>

            <text syncTime="3421.133" offset="13684506">And in this -- in this case, they answered our procedure down there and I don't know where the -- and in this case came up from Fort Smith and it's a question of an injunction being all inclusive and this injunction, it's drawn in this case, it was drawn from the worrying of this -- the Tuckers case and the Riggs-Tucker case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3454.024" offset="13816059">The objection of that injunction against all picketing of appellee's place of business whether done peaceably or not was too broad and in access to the jurisdiction of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.929" offset="13859631">The grant could not be sustained where the answers to the complaint asking that the injunction be made violent, did not raise such an issue or denied that the picketing had been conducted in an unlawful manner and there was nothing to indicate an intention to modify the methods used.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.553" offset="13934132">No legislation has been enacted in this State, depriving the courts of power to issue injunctions and labor strikes and proper cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.642" offset="13966524">While labors have the right to organize for the purpose of collective bargaining or improve the conditions upon which they work to go on strike if these demands are not met and to peacefully picket as a means of enforcing their demands, they may not use force, violence, coercion or intimidation but must so use their right to strike and picket as not to interfere with the rights of others.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.390" offset="14061505">When picketing is so unlawful as to indicate the defendants do not intend to use their right in a lawful manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.899" offset="14087523">It may reasonably be expected that such unlawful conduct will in the absence of an injunction continue and the trial court may in exercise of their discretion enjoined further picketing all together.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.093" offset="14140291">Where picketing conducted by defendant consists of one continuous transaction involving unlawful conduct on their part and showing by a systematic course of conduct and concerted action, their intention to accomplish their purpose even by unlawful means, actually will do complete justice by enjoining the whole of the unlawful proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.232" offset="14240914">Now, over here, that -- that has been the law in our States since 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.750" offset="14290965">Now, the last -- on page 584 of the opinion, we repeat again the issue involved in the trial of this Court and the court rule was not that of the right to picket peacefully.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.934" offset="14351673">The Chancery on his opinion quoted from Mr. (Inaudible) case which expressly recognizes that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.255" offset="14376960">The appellants did not ask a modification of the temporary restraining order to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.325" offset="14401202">On the contrary, they denied having violated any law or any of the rights of their employer and there was manifested an intention to continue the conduct they had previously pursued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.196" offset="14452715">It was evidently the view of the court below that the right of picketing peacefully could not be made excuse for the concerted plan of intimidation, coercion and violence which the pickets were employing, not only with the approval but with the instigation -- instigation of the leaders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.707" offset="14534740">Now, that -- that has been our law down there and it -- the question is whether that violates the -- it's too broad or violates the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.205" offset="14580820">We don't think it does in this case because as we quote in our brief, Milk Wagon Drivers versus Meadowmoor and also, 132 A.L.R. and down the proper procedure is for respondents to file a motion to modify the injunction in the trial court even when respondents are able to show the trial court, that peaceful picketing would be carried on by the union, they are free to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3685.312" offset="14741211">The union does not attempt to make any such showing.</text>

            <label>Mr. William J. Isaacson</label>
            <text syncTime="5042.873" offset="20171442">The Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="5043.899" offset="20175517">I'm sure there is inadvertent on Mr. Shaver's part to indicate that there was anything -- for example the mass picketing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5050.770" offset="20202998">There is no such finding in this record on the court below, none whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="5056.163" offset="20224627">There was no mass picketing here of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="5058.944" offset="20235703">People walk in and out with no blockage or interference or interest here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5063.988" offset="20255869">Now, I want to turn for a moment to the -- to the Meadowmoor point that seven of the justices raised in the question of Mr. Shaver here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5072.306" offset="20289202">I think that it was explained from the -- some of the questions were put that there's a complete understanding as to what Meadowmoor meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5080.223" offset="20320862">Meadowmoor meant that where you have violence in such frequency in depth and the character that you had in Meadowmoor is there, such intensity that you had in Meadowmoor that if you have a course of trust into the future so that any beholder of a picket line knowing of the past would look upon that picket line as -- as a arm with a club, so to speak, or arm with a bomb which is true in Meadowmoor then under those circumstances -- under those circumstances you can prevent -- prohibit all picketing including peaceful picketing because there is no such thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5111.520" offset="20446041">It's been transmuted into something quite different than peaceful picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5115.303" offset="20461192">This is not the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5117.202" offset="20468715">Here, as a matter of fact, the very image was not sufficient to deter or persuade anyone not to enter.</text>
            <text syncTime="5124.259" offset="20497032">Certainly, the after image if there is an after image here of the speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="5129.363" offset="20517407">This is what you have to find.</text>
            <text syncTime="5130.627" offset="20522423">There is an after image of the speech, certainly wasn't sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="5133.406" offset="20533603">Now, turning for a moment to the violence, so-called acts of violence which the court below apparently considered to be violent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5140.561" offset="20562233">I just wanted to point out that these several incidents, as Mr. Shaver has indicated, two of them took place during the earlier proceeding there and which is not -- which is not the subject matter of the complaint and certainly cannot be a -- a matter concerning which a -- a Court can utilize the support for an injunction This was a matter at the prior proceeding there.</text>
            <text syncTime="5164.163" offset="20656588">Now, as to one of the matters there, I think, Mr. Shaver press inadvertently didn't elaborate upon and that was the so-called threat.</text>
            <text syncTime="5171.747" offset="20686890">It's only the threat in the record to personal safety of any of these -- any person and that I'm sure its inadvertence in his part when he failed to mention the plant manager, that he's doing the threats addressed about wiping up the walk with the sending back to Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="5190.655" offset="20762540">That was made by a woman and that Mr. Bonady, the plant manager said in the record personally, “I don't think she's big enough to do it unless she's going to have an awful lot of help.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5202.700" offset="20810710">This doesn't sound to me -- this doesn't make any seriousness or take it with any degree of seriousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="5208.160" offset="20832549">As to the -- as to the incident concerning which Justice Whittaker asked me, that is the snake, I think it's plain the from the testimony that -- that Mr. Shaver himself read into the record there, at great length that there is no connection whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="5223.970" offset="20895869">None whatsoever in the Supreme Court of Arkansas doesn't find the connection between the snake incident and strikers.</text>

            <text syncTime="5247.262" offset="20988970">I just -- I will now -- will now come back to the -- to the question here which is -- which as I see it and it would appear from the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="5255.312" offset="21021153">The only question we -- before this Court really at this point is the right of strikers to stand on their property by the way and the Court makes this point on their property for the most part.</text>
            <text syncTime="5268.469" offset="21073816">There are some indications there may have been on the street on occasion that the court makes no real point of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5273.496" offset="21093982">It would appear that to the most part, they stood on their property on strike headquarters and call the strike breakers scab.</text>
            <text syncTime="5280.217" offset="21120836">I would like to say as to that, particularly relating it to questions of Mr. Justice Black and that is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5287.859" offset="21151347">That this is the precisely the kind of question on which the expertise of the Labor Board must be brought into.</text>
            <text syncTime="5295.816" offset="21183216">This is the kind of question in which the Board has passed several times now and has been referred to these cases in our brief and has found this kind of activity to be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="5305.610" offset="21222400">We're not only talking now about the preemption in the terms of Garner.</text>
            <text syncTime="5311.407" offset="21245597">We were talking about an interference with protected activity under Section 7 and Section 13 of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5319.609" offset="21278407">I submit to this Court where you have this kind of a question, certainly, it should in the first instance as this Court has said in countless preemption cases and all.</text>
            <text syncTime="5328.344" offset="21313306">There'd be some 16 since Garner by this Court and countless of those cases, this Court has said in the first instance where you have this kind of a question, where you cannot be sure as to whether it is a protected activity or a proscribed activity that it must go to the Labor Board in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5348.080" offset="21392300">And I say to you that if it is a proscribed activity, then certainly as Mr. Justice Black indicated, then it certainly a matter for the Labor Board and this is not the kind of situation which was meant in the Kohler case which came up here under the name of UAW against Wisconsin Employment Relations Board at the last term or the term preceding the last term and that is this is not the kind of situation where you have violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5371.738" offset="21486864">This is not the kind of situation where you have overt threat or violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5375.026" offset="21500029">It's not the kind of situation where you have mass picketing where you have this kind of post question, I say it must in the first instance go to the Labor Board to determine whether it's protected or whether it's proscribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5387.212" offset="21548826">And let me just make the final observation, had it gone to the Labor Board how different -- how different the circumstance would be now.</text>
            <text syncTime="5393.554" offset="21574113">Had it gone to the Labor Board, the Labor Board would have done probably what the Wisconsin Labor Relations Board did if it found -- if it found this to be appropriate activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5401.694" offset="21606713">It would have -- it would have limited its injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5404.115" offset="21616431">If you recall in the Kohler case, when it came before this Court, in the Kohler case, the Wisconsin Labor Relations Board despite the fact that they were dealing with threats, despite the fact they were dealing with mass picketing, despite the kind of rather intensive conduct that they had -- misconduct that they had there.</text>
            <text syncTime="5421.315" offset="21685185">Despite all of that there is a limited -- a limited cease and desist order that -- that issue certainly in this particular proceeding, I am certain that this Labor Board would issue a cease and desist order of a limited nature applying only to the calling of the term scab if they found it to be an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5440.198" offset="21760731">And one final observation, if I may, and that is that this Labor Board would certainly have considered the fact in coming to the question that whether or not strikers, standing as a minority here in this small community in Arkansas whether or not strikers have the right to utter this kind of thing, they would have considered the provocation and unfair labor practices on the part of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="5465.138" offset="21860519">This is what this Court had reference to in the (Inaudible) case when they made this point so very carefully there that there is something quite different when it comes before the Labor Board which has the power to go in and look into all of the surrounding circumstances and break the barrier of its expertise upon the entire Labor Relations controversy not piecemeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="5484.033" offset="21936065">I say that the Board would have under those circumstances look into the entire controversy and into the unfair labor practices which were I believe they would have found on the record here.</text>
