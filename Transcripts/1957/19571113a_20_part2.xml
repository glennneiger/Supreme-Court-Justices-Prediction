          <turn speaker="amos_m_mathews" startTime="0.000" stopTime="554.020">
            <label>Mr. Amos M. Mathews</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">-- continuation of the argument, first I want to go back to this matter of rates that has been talked about.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.722" offset="46811">I said at the recess that when the commission, when Congress wants to give unlimited discretion to an administrative body they use the term public convenience and necessity, but when they want to attach some condition such as appellants are seeking to attach to the Commission's authority here, then Congress uses specific limiting words.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.610" offset="158407">Now that was evident in the Natural Gas Act; the Natural Gas Act as it first was enacted was held by the Federal Power Commission to prevent railroads and coal and labor interest from objecting to the extension of natural gas lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.868" offset="227370">But as the legislative history shows, that we set out in our brief, Congress amended the act for the very purpose of permitting coal, labor and railroad interest to come before the Federal Power Commission and object to the extension of natural gas lines, and how did Congress bring that about?</text>
            <text syncTime="74.928" offset="299677">Congress brought that about by incorporating in the Natural Gas Act the language of 207 (a) of the Interstate Commerce Act, the very act we have under consideration here.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.687" offset="350668">And the same committee of Congress that brought about that result and intentionally so as the legislative history shows, I haven't time to read it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.804" offset="391210">The same committee -- the House Committee on Interstate Commerce, the same men within two months of that also approved the Freight Forwarder Act of 1942.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.938" offset="439693">And they provided in that act that the Commission could not deny authority to engage in business as a freight forwarder because another freight forwarder was rendering service in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.061" offset="508238">That proved to allow entering into the freight forwarder business and make it too easy and it didn't protect freight forwarders already in the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.941" offset="547736">So in 1957 Congress amended that act by changing those conditions and providing that any one entered -- wishing to enter the business of a freight forwarder must prove consistency with a public interest except that a rail controlled freight forwarder -- the application of a rail controlled freight forwarder could not be denied on the ground that there was another freight forwarder operating in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.388" offset="677512">I have gone over those very hastily.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.405" offset="689528">They are all set out in our brief, but they show very clearly that Congress knows exactly -- Congress didn't reach into a hat and draw out a collection of words and as it sometimes do throw it to this Court to determine what Congress meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.821" offset="755252">Congress says use this term, the term public convenience and necessity in these statutes and has used variance of that phrase over the past 37 years in such a way to demonstrate that the language of 207 (a) of the Interstate Commerce Act comprehends that the Interstate Commerce Commission has power to determine that public convenience and necessity does not require motor carrier service in an area where there is adequate railroad service despite the fact that there maybe no other motor carrier service serving the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.290" offset="901120">Now that is very clear in that course of legislative history and as I say I think that was made clear back in 1942 in the decision of this Court in Alton Railroad Company against United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.622" offset="950439">Now going to this matter of rates, it is -- it would seem perfectly clear that in a certificate proceeding where a motor carrier or any carrier for that matter files application for authority to institute new service that that cannot possibly be the occasion of determining questions of rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.594" offset="1090351">There is adequate rate machinery provided in the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.668" offset="1110622">Just as a rough illustration let me show you what I mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.668" offset="1126609">Supposing a motor carrier applies for a certificate for a new service between A and B, and the railroads come in and they show that they can furnish better service at cheaper rates between A and B than this motor carrier offers, is that to be an answer in a certificate case?</text>
            <text syncTime="306.006" offset="1223993">The Acts of Congress that I've referred to make it very clear that public convenience and necessity comprehend service and that the rate factors are to be handled in other situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.656" offset="1286583">Now getting down to this case, it seems to me there has been -- the rate argument has taken much wider scope than it should have, because there isn't a word to proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.342" offset="1337365">The applicant here didn't even try to prove that he would give a better rate than the existing rail rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.533" offset="1370070">He tried to prove that he would give better service, but the commission held that he would not and that finding has not been attacked in anyway, shape or form.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.908" offset="1419598">One consideration here, this is certainly not a perishable commodity, granite monuments, and the evidence shows that the reason, the rail -- for complaints against slow rail service was that shippers waited as much as 99 days I think in one particular case to accumulate a carload, so as to take advantage of the rail carload rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.310" offset="1541224">The only -- and the evidence is conclusive on this also.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.224" offset="1568810">A few shippers testified that if, on cross examination, that if Schaffer, the applicant, charged a higher rate than the railroads, he wouldn't get their business.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.649" offset="1626593">Now – so I – the -- if you just think over a certificate case, and an application for authority or see that it just would be impossible to try out all the questions of rates involved and as I say the conclusive answer I think here is that the applicant didn't even try to make a showing that he would give a better rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.294" offset="1729097">There was nothing in here at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.049" offset="1736098">A few shippers said they'd like to have better rates, but the applicant himself didn't make any such showing.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.612" offset="1758354">Now, there has been a statement made that there is no evidence of the impact of granting this service upon the railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.426" offset="1813629">All of the traffic that is here in controversy upwards of 4 million pounds a year have granite from Vermont to the 16 Midwestern states is now moving by rail.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.957" offset="1855739">Any of it that would taken by the result of granting of this application would be taken from the railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.719" offset="1882802">Now there again, that was considered a sufficient -- in the Alton Railroad case, there was no evidence as to the specific amount of traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.912" offset="1907566">There was only evidence of the railroads were serving all the points in question, and that was held in that case to give the railroads to require the economic status of the railroads to be given consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.643" offset="1962527">Now the commission considered the adequacy of the railroad service and nobody has attacked its findings in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.379" offset="2005473">They considered the need of the shippers, found they were adequately being supplied by the railroad service, nobody has said the Commission's -- the evidence before the Commission doesn't support that finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.467" offset="2081855">Of course the rate question sort of came in -- sort of through the back door you might say, simply a few shippers said gratuitously that they'd like better rates, but the applicant didn't respond to that by saying well sure you're going to have better rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.108" offset="2160431">Thank You.</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter T. Beardsley</label>
            <text syncTime="557.551" offset="2230126">Agreed that the question of rates came in here by the back door.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.531" offset="2246113">The applicant didn't try to make a showing that he would quote lower rates for the simple reason that had he done so the Commission would have told him, the commissioner or the examiner on the objection that the rail (Inaudible) would have said rates are not relevant for a proceeding like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.606" offset="2302328">By and large the question of rates came into the record because of rail counsel, on cross examination of the shipper witness brought out that they would like lower rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.799" offset="2339109">Now there isn't a shipper in the country I contend, I talked to a few of them, that won't tell you no matter what form of transportation he uses, he thinks his rates are too high, and if all that remains to be done in cases of this kind is for rail counsel to innocently inquire of a supporting shipper in a motor case, do you think your rates are too high and if he is honest he will say yes they are, then they come back to the Commission and say these shippers are motivated by desire for lower rates, their goal is to dismiss the application and that is the gist of their argument no matter how they try to feather it up.</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter T. Beardsley</label>
            <text syncTime="621.637" offset="2486544">No, I really don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.036" offset="2496052">I really don't think that rates as such are relevant except to the extent that the Commission has allowed this rate argument which crept in sideways into this case to deprive the shippers of a opportunity by utilization of this motor service proposed to be run to first get an improved service and second to get the benefit rate wise if you please of competition between the true forms of transportation within this so called zone of reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.281" offset="2613081">Obviously if there is only rail service, the rail rates are going to be at the top of zone of reason.</text>

            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="659.112" offset="2636382">Well if rates are irrelevant what were the considerations, the shipper's point of view of having this service unless the record discloses that the railroad are not -- transportation is taken care of it.</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter T. Beardsley</label>
            <text syncTime="677.384" offset="2709525">Well, Mr. Justice Frankfurter I will simply refer you to the report of division five, where at the bottom of page 21 of the record and the top of page 22, there are laid out many complaints as to the existing rail service.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.667" offset="2762606">Now the Commission on reconsideration didn't say that Commission-5 was wrong as to these findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.845" offset="2787370">They simply said we find that rail service is adequate and (Inaudible) we deny the application.</text>

          <turn speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="701.931" stopTime="717.279">
            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="701.931" offset="2807641">Well suppose if it is a question of Division 5 of the whole Commission on those items of inadequacy, isn't that a question of fact on which unless it is taken out of the thin air, this Commission -- this Court is bound by the Commission.</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter T. Beardsley</label>
            <text syncTime="717.279" offset="2869081">I would go so far to say that and that is precisely the reason why rail counsel is correct when he says we have not challenged the commission's findings of fact because we are implicit in their conclusions of law that the existence of adequate rail service bars a grant of motor carrier authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.546" offset="2938149">And we say that no matter how adequate the existing rail service is, shippers are entitled, as this Court held in effect in the McLean case with respect to water transportation.</text>

            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="768.333" offset="3073254">Well, that's a question of facts but I am – Division 5 said there are inadequacies, the Commission overruled them, you say we can't reveal that and therefore we must take it on the assumption that Commission found there was adequacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.116" offset="3128424">Now what is left is the legal proposition that a motor carrier came in and said I wanted to compete with adequate rail service, and you say, they must grant it because if the general interest of competition, is that it?</text>

            <text syncTime="798.849" offset="3195298">As I said earlier in the answer to Mr. Justice Harlan's question that I think what the commission may have done here is to confuse the element of proof in a given case with the requirements of Section 207.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.723" offset="3242841">Now that's the only other thing I want to touch on.</text>

            <text syncTime="812.749" offset="3250991">But if you want to – if you – does that mean that -- if that means that the report of the Commission is so obscure that we can't tell the ground on which they were, if that's the issue you are tipping, I understand that too.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.799" offset="3311177">But that's a very different thing from saying as I thought you indicated, and I can understand that too, I just want to know that although the Commission found as a non reviewable facts here were no inadequacy the rail service because it is a carrier and thereafter it competes with all the potentialities of competition, they must give them the certificate?</text>

            <text syncTime="852.465" offset="3409816">And all we are saying is that the question of adequacy is not properly his burden as far as the other type of service is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.021" offset="3443984">Now the other thing that I want to touch on here is the argument of rail counsel confined almost entirely to Section 207 and his contention that in effect the commission has been given absolute discretion to determine in any given case what is PC&amp;N under Section 207?</text>
            <text syncTime="876.814" offset="3507200">Well that argument entirely overlooks the provisions of the national transportation policy which govern – which are -- have to be taken into consideration in that determination under 207 as well as on the other factor as well as on the other part of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.576" offset="3566237">And certainly to say that the Commission has been given on limited discretion in the face of language in the national transportation policy which says it shall positively preserve the inherited advantages of the motor transportation that just seem to me to be overlooking the obvious meaning of (Inaudible)</text>
