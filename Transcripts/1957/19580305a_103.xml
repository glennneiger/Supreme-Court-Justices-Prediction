            <label>Mr. Joseph F. Grossman</label>
            <text syncTime="38.982" offset="155899">This case is here by writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.361" offset="189440">The suit was instituted in the United States District Court for a declaratory judgment and injunction by 21 frontline railroads operating to and from the City of Chicago in the interstate commerce and in the intrastate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.925" offset="275644">And the respondent, Railroad Transfer Service, Incorporated hereafter called “Transfer” for short, an uncertified motor carrier transferring passengers between terminal facilities of the various railroads of which there were I think eight in number in the City of Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.016" offset="431961">None of the railroads pass through the City of Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.751" offset="450978">There are eight terminals.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.102" offset="460382">Two of them on the west side of the Chicago River and six of them on the south and east side of the Chicago River, some distance south.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.609" offset="514403">The distance between the terminals vary from about a quarter of a mile to two miles distance.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.171" offset="572604">The case involved the construction or in the alternative as the pleading showed, the constitutionality of a city ordinance licensing the -- and regulating the use of the city streets by a motor vehicle for hire.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.531" offset="658077">The ordinance was known as Chapter 28 of the Municipal Court of Chicago which appears in the record at page -- beginning at page 171.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.388" offset="741460">Parmelee Transportation Company, another uncertified motor carrier intervened in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.095" offset="796317">The Parmelee Company having -- have a contract of the railroads to operate at the -- the motor vehicles in the transfer of passengers in interstate commerce and intrastate commerce prior to the termination of that contract and the substitution of the Railroad Transfer Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.596" offset="926302">At that time until -- October 1, 1955, the terminal line had a contract arrangement with Parmelee as I said to furnish their service.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.144" offset="984503">But that operation was not limited to interstation service on through route railroad carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.476" offset="1017835">It also carried passengers for cash fares between terminal stations and from substations to hotels and other places within the central business district of the City of Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.053" offset="1080111">Parmelee's operations were licensed as terminal vehicles under the city code relating to the public passenger vehicles, the licensing of public passenger vehicles.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.951" offset="1147716">At that time, referring to the ordinance, a public passenger vehicle was defined by the code as a motor vehicle which is used for the transportation of passengers for hire accepting those devoted exclusively for funeral use or any operation of a Metropolitan Transit Authority or public utility under the laws of Illinois and the terminal vehicle was defined as a public passenger vehicle which is operated under contracts with the railroad and steamship companies exclusively for the transfer of passengers from terminal stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.116" offset="1344366">Then Section 28-2 provided, it is unlawful for any person other than the Metropolitan Transit Authority or public utility to operate any vehicle or for any such person who is the owner of any vehicle to permit it to be operated on any public way for the transportation of passengers for hire from place to place within the corporate limits of the city except on a funeral trip unless it is licensed by the city as a public passenger vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.700" offset="1502772">Those are the pertinent provisions of the ordinance which are involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.217" offset="1552823">Parmelee's operations as I said were licensed as terminal vehicles.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.816" offset="1575184">Early in June 1955, the terminal lines notified Parmelee that their contractual arrangement would be terminated and other provision made for the transfer of passengers on through route tickets between terminal stations in Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.006" offset="1659925">On July 26, 1955, the City Council passed an ordinance amending the city code by eliminating the requirement of a contractual arrangement with railroad companies to qualify terminal vehicles for license and limiting the number of such vehicles to those licensed unless after a public hearing is provided by the ordinance, public convenience and necessity require additional service of the character described.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.412" offset="1817600">That provision in the ordinance was the -- in 2231-1 or 28 -- no, excuse me, it was 28-31.1, Chapter 28.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.475" offset="1929822">It was amended at the same time that the definition of terminal vehicles was amended and also the section relating to the operation of terminal route vehicles which was limited to the central business district of the City of Chicago and it provided for a determination of public convenience and necessity prior to the issuance of any licenses for additional terminal vehicles.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.576" offset="2066286">Now, Parmelee was then operating of course not in the transfer of passengers on through routes either in intrastate commerce or interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.874" offset="2131487">It was operating after termination of its contract as a local public passenger vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.381" offset="2173492">Still under license, transporting for a cash fare, passengers who happened to be at any railroad station to the hotels and to any destination which the passenger himself directed.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.712" offset="2282789">The case was submitted in the District Court on the question of the construction of the contract both by the complaints and by the motion of the City of Chicago for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.038" offset="2364082">The motion for summary judgment by the City of Chicago requested the Court to determine whether the Plaintiff by virtue of its contract with the plaintiff railroad company is operating its vehicles within the City of Chicago as exclusively as agent born in behalf of plaintiff railroads as public utilities under the law of Illinois, whether the plaintiff's operations are confined, the transportation of passengers on through route railroad and steamship transportation tickets between point out -- points outside of the corporate limits of the city in intrastate and interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.176" offset="2592601">Now, the plaintiff in this case of course or the railroads and the Transfer Company, the Railroad Transfer Corporation under the new contract and whether said the plaintiff operates any vehicle on any public way for transportation of passenger for hire from place to place within the Court limits of the city as provided by Section 28-2 of the Municipal Court of Chicago, whether said plaintiff is operating terminal vehicles within the City of Chicago as defined in Section 28-1 of the Municipal Court of Chicago as amended in 1955, whether any of the said plaintiff's operations are in local transportation of passengers at rates of fares subject to Section 28-31.2 of the Municipal Court of Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.257" offset="2840973">Now, I ought to make reference to 28-31.2 to indicate what kind of an operation it brought because under the powers of the City Council in the City of Chicago, the city has the right to determine the rates of fare of these passenger vehicles.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.844" offset="2931357">And 28-31.2 provides that the rate of fare for local transportation of every passenger in terminal vehicles of the licensee shall be uniform regardless of the distance traveled provided that children under 12 years of age, when accompanied by an adult, shall be carried not more than half the fare.</text>

            <text syncTime="829.291" offset="3317133">And the point to that I make is that the Court of Appeals determined that 28-31.1, the public convenience and necessity provision gave Parmelee in effect a monopoly of the streets of the City of Chicago for the transfer of passengers between terminal stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.411" offset="3421623">Whereas the point I make is that 28-31.1 was applicable to Parmelee because it was a local transportation facility after the enactment of the amendment, but 28-31.1 could not be applicable to the transport corporation because it was under the -- under its contract exclusively for the transfer of passengers between terminal stations in intrastate and interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.290" offset="3597061">And so far as the intrastate commerce is concerned of course, there's no question about there ever having been required to have a license and even so far as the interstate commerce is concerned.</text>
