            <label>Mr. Silas Blake Axtell</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">-- back towards the reach of this modern steamer.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.160" offset="48588">Now, I want to discuss the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.944" offset="71680">It was just 50 years ago that I first met Andrew Furuseth who designed the LaFollette's Seamen's Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.001" offset="107938">I was a clerk in the office of the Seamen's Branch of the Legal Aid Society.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.058" offset="132180">Continued there for 8 years, and eventually I became officially counselor for Mr. Furuseth's union called the International Seamen's Union of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.679" offset="202710">The first edition of the Seamen's Act was not signed by President Taft because it affected foreign ships, and there was so much protest from foreign governments who didn't want any changes made.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.692" offset="278674">The Titanic disaster happened April 15th, I remember it distinctly; 2000 people nearly drowned, more than half of the people on the ship, the ship and though advertised is the safest thing ever built, had life preservers and rafts enough for only, 40% of the people on board.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.288" offset="397061">So we seized that opportunity to frame up a safety law that would apply to all foreign ships as well as American in carrying of passengers.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.754" offset="447007">The Jones Act, Section 20 was my idea, that is the, to try to modify the fellow servant rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.430" offset="485669">You would laugh if I read to you from our old brief in the Chelantis case.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.023" offset="520046">We argued that the case was governed by the common law, not by the maritime law.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.665" offset="546586">The source to that idea was The Osceola case which court had said formally that fellow servant rule is a defense and our lawyers and judges all believe it.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.621" offset="610429">Then came the great decision of Justice McReynolds for this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.337" offset="629342">When we went back to the (Inaudible) 1774 and discovered that it had been effectively and intelligently stated then, we have a general maritime law of our own.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.165" offset="696633">And thus the Compensation Act which we since learned were originated by Mr. Marks, adopted by people everywhere to overcome the terrible defenses of the common law, the assumption of risk doctrine and contributory negligence which defeated so many claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.530" offset="806034">He said that the Compensation Act of Maryland, and New York were varied the uniformity of the maritime law, and so of course the seaman and the longshoreman were relegated to the maritime law.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.201" offset="888790">The thing came to a head with me in the Bird case in Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.290" offset="913136">I was on trial 1919.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.269" offset="925048">I had been to sea that summer.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.433" offset="957649">The court was seriously considering for several months, the Circuit Court, whether the Judiciary Act of 1331 really saved any remedy for seamen of a trial by jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.765" offset="1027030">Some of our district judges of that age, of that date who have died long since, were quite reactionary and hard, and it was very difficult to get what I as a lawyer of the Legal Aid Society considered justice.</text>

            <label>Mr. Silas Blake Axtell</label>
            <text syncTime="280.532" offset="1122116">No, I have adopted his decision as a very divine thing, because he has laid the groundwork for word of law, adopting the ancient maritime law, modifying it as we can.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.299" offset="1209156">It's what we say it is, all foreign ships entering here are subject to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.722" offset="1230785">If they don't like it, they can stay out.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.433" offset="1241652">That was the argument that brought the great Justice Sutherland into this thing in 1919-20, the decision in the Dillon-Strathearn case.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.370" offset="1285433">Within 37 days after the decision in that case, Senator Jones pushes through this Jones Act that contained about 100 or more amendments of the Maritime Law, three relating to seamen; one of them the provision that changed the (Inaudible), the courts have found that it was not effective and we have modified it, Senator Jones and Mr. Furuseth (Inaudible) in office, it was Senator Sutherland, he'd only a -- well, it was just like next week to see him.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.928" offset="1463693">They had taken the act and amended it to read that the seamen were entitled to half the wages earned and unpaid, because under the articles where we'd provide it in the original bill, they should get half the wages due them.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.911" offset="1559615">The Court concluded that there wasn't anything due them because their contract said that there wasn't anything due them.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.650" offset="1590544">We got John W. Davidson to help us in the Jackson-Archimedes case that he was not successful.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.567" offset="1626175">They held that even those advances made in foreign ports were valid, even though our act said in anticipation that it could not be considered in figuring accountable wages of the seamen here.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.432" offset="1689704">I speak to you intimately of this thing because it's been my life.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.868" offset="1715409">I have carried on so far as I was able, the work of Andrew Furuseth or tried to.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.549" offset="1742158">It's the greatest example of this country's development that I know.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.943" offset="1771729">This humble man from Norway, educating himself, coming here conceiving, that under the Thirteenth Amendment it was illegal to have men arrested for quitting their jobs, carrying a thing through as he did in 1897 to the Supreme Court in which Justice Holland dissented and Mr. Douglas pointed out in 1898, the White Act, destroyed, arrest for desertion for American Seamen on American ships, but we wanted it to apply to the foreign seamen on the foreign ships and we devised and amended the act in every way we could think of to extend it to foreign ships, to give them freedom too, so that their visit to the shores of America meant a better freedom to anybody and everybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.124" offset="2016444">Where we went back, we went in the Southern Building, Furuseth and I, and Senator Sutherland to the office of Senator Jones.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.158" offset="2052598">You won't find any hearings on this Section 33 of the Jones Act, why?</text>
            <text syncTime="519.630" offset="2078511">Because I had argued the Abdu Nigretia case before the Supreme Court reported 247 U.S. 27, and lost it on the ground that we had not in saying that courts in United States are open to seamen included the words, including the appellate court and this Court under in a established rule held that the act did not benefit the Hindus who demanded half wages in Brooklyn unless they are shipped.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.411" offset="2221558">Well, Senator Jones remedied that, give me your amendment boy.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.334" offset="2241306">He was about 6 feet 6, black-haired, ex-Methodist minister from State of Washington, (Inaudible) he says none of the congress, none of the senators won't go home at government expanse until this bill is signed, and he tacked it on the Civil Sundry Appropriation act and you find, the decision was April 21st of the Supreme Court and the amendment was July 1st at the same year, phenomenal, wasn't it?</text>
            <text syncTime="589.181" offset="2356663">Now, I'll natural to go to the Supreme Court to Mr. Jones about our amendment in the Jones Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.091" offset="2384353">Senator Reynolds had -- McReynolds judge McReynolds, I think a great decision I say this more sincerely.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.250" offset="2420924">I was so ignorant of the history of our Maritime Law and I began that it wasn't funny.</text>

            <text syncTime="614.070" offset="2456242">The Chelantis case.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.553" offset="2466168">That's where he implied what he'd already said in Southern Paciﬁc against Jensen and we discussed the question of the jury trial on account of the threat of an appeal of the Supreme Court in the Bird case and what I've seen happened in the Chelantis case, I said I'm going to write this thing and a seaman may elect, write an argument about that, Senator Sutherland said that it isn't necessary, constitution's got a right, don't have to have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.546" offset="2630113">I insisted.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.565" offset="2638158">They let me have my way and the rest of the act was written by Senator Sutherland, making a Railway Act applicable to seamen by reference.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.554" offset="2690194">Well I've tried five time before this to get here.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.427" offset="2717675">(Inaudible), Hogan against The Hamburg-American Line, Holler case, one of them – Judge Learned Hand in his Taylor against Atlantic Maritime which was reversed by this Court, the opinion by Mr. Justice Jackson, he, when the case, the Jones Act came before in the 1924 on a motion made by Vernon Jones of the big firm of Kirlan, Campbell &amp; Keating, denied the motion to dismiss and said I think it's ridiculous to argue that Congress intended this act to apply only to American seamen, why it would American shipping at such a disadvantage?</text>
            <text syncTime="737.783" offset="2951105">They settled the case, never went any further.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.249" offset="3008993">In the Paula case Justice Learned Hand sat and my brief was simply a restatement of his decision in Stewart against The Pacific Mail Steamship Company and his answer was, well I was just a District Judge then.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.205" offset="3104810">That made any difference in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.454" offset="3121737">He didn't say a word about it in his decision, Taylor against Atlantic Maritime, not a word.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.098" offset="3148382">In the Taylor case he adapted a compromise.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.527" offset="3166041">He along with a judge who wrote the opinion in Paula had said we think that we couldn't apply this law to foreign ships unless Congress makes it more clear that that was the intention.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.121" offset="3240438">I say to you that if the defendants here want relief from the Jones Act, they must apply to Congress to get it.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.796" offset="3283174">In the absence of treaties, they are governed.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.288" offset="3301146">What is the source of it?</text>
            <text syncTime="826.871" offset="3307416">Harden against Gardner, could you read those all cases Read against (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="836.016" offset="3343987">He opened the doors of American courts to all seamen and they were seamen from all country then just as same as the Reynolds.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.293" offset="3377110">And after that for 50, 60 years these foreign governments to home or here now started writing treaties, commerce and friendship they called them, and Article 23 and 24 related to control of the crewmen who are visiting our ports that those matters internal regime with the ship including torts, injuries, neglected treats would it be governed by the law over the flag of the ship?</text>
            <text syncTime="879.515" offset="3517962">When we stripped that away, I wrote that provision too in the Seamen's Act, Section 16, I think Mr. Furuseth is set to talk about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.333" offset="3565296">I knew enough about the constitution, I know that there is provision that said that the treaties are the highest law of the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.806" offset="3603122">So we directed the President to abrogate those treaties.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.630" offset="3626423">Mr. Taft wouldn't sign the bill, but Woodrow Wilson signed the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.989" offset="3667905">Judge Denman, former head of the shipping board, Honored Circuit Judge of the Ninth Circuit, the oldest living judge I guess in the federal judge sitting today, was counseled to the ship honoring crowd in their dealings and knew Furuseth and Woodrow Wilson happened to ask him, Mr. Denman what shall I do without this thing?</text>
            <text syncTime="945.171" offset="3780650">He says, sign it.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.772" offset="3795069">A letter from Denman and then the rest by him is in this little book, that I've taken the privilege of putting in the library of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.267" offset="3832999">You find on page 222, a picture of the seaman and the senators and the congressman and the Seamen's Act and Woodrow Wilson at the top and here in the third line is Judge Sutherland, read the citations quoting from his findings and Senator Jones on this very law, read the decision of Judge Sutherland in O'Hara against Luckenbach, where the ship owners had disregarded the provision that required that the crew be divided in the equal watches and that caused several disasters, (Inaudible) one of them, (Inaudible) didn't -- wasn't prevented by Judge Sutherland's decision, but this great lawyer designed this Jones Act and it was his considered judgment and I heard in the discussion with Senator Jones that the amendment of the law giving the seamen election any seaman election gave the individual the choice, he could invoke jurisdiction of a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.289" offset="4205087">That's what America is for, that's our trouble to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.687" offset="4218671">Then (Inaudible) has saved us from discretion of Sputnik Business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.176" offset="4236643">He came from Germany.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.873" offset="4243435">So he said was the first American to learn that the Thirteenth Amendment was in conflict with a provision to the Seamen's Act that permitted the man to be sent to jail for refusing to work, the very essence of our freedom, isn't it?</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.936" offset="4327654">It took a foreigner to do that and no reason, a poor man, self-educated person, man of the greatest culture and aesthetic, who said a labor union leader could be youthful should have nothing in his own and want nothing for himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.572" offset="4402260">I spent 30 years with that old man, always at the Capital Hotel before the decisions of this Court, in the case the (Inaudible) case, the Abdu case, I don't know, six different Chief Justices who sat on cases I'd had the opportunity to come here in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.938" offset="4487732">This isn't a great, great experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.190" offset="4516676">Any lawyer who had the ability training, a lawyer ought to have would have done better than I have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.559" offset="4570175">All I have had to contribute was persistence, not too much intelligence, but I have learned with Andrew Furuseth that to work is to worship and to labor is to pray and in my labors I pray that god will tell you how to decide this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1203.453" offset="4813740">I address myself first to the interest of the Spanish Line, Compania Trasatlantica.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.159" offset="4848536">The single or rather major point by the respondent Compania in the lower courts and here is simply whether this seaman can maintain suit under the Jones Act and under the General Admiralty Law against respondent Compania Trasatlantica.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.221" offset="4972878">I would like to touch on the facts and the procedure as it went on in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.783" offset="5011122">In the answer of Compania Trasatlantica and it appeared generally and it does not say that the District Court did not have jurisdiction and does not have a jurisdiction of a complaint upon which the face of it stakes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.788" offset="5075069">There is an action under the Jones Act, no question of the jurisdictions of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.446" offset="5101714">The point we raised in our pleadings and the point we raised in the District Court was that this Spanish seaman could not maintain suit against this Spanish corporation under the Jones Act and under the General Admiralty Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.178" offset="5176633">The suit was on the law side of the Federal Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1307.478" offset="5229819">The authority for that, the authority for that is in Rule 12 of The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, I've quoted that rule on pages 25 and 26 in my brief and that rule provides that where defenses such as those raised by the Spanish Line and its answers are presented and the party asked the District Court to consider the defenses preliminary to trail, those defenses, the rule said shall be heard and determined before trial on application of any party unless the court orders that the hearing and determination thereof be deferred until the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.023" offset="5436082">The rule further provides that a defense which they have numbered six, failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, but if that rule is considered the District Court can go outside the complaint, outside the pleadings, take testimony or consider other factors and other matters and shall treat the motion as one for its summary judgment under Rule 56.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.068" offset="5580173">The purpose of the rule is quite simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.017" offset="5596056">If we accept the petitioner's position, no motion after a defendant has appeared generally in an action, no motion addressed to the right of the plaintiff to maintain the action could ever be heard in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.651" offset="5666586">We have to go through a full trial even it took weeks and then at the end of that trial with the court undoubtedly in many cases its mind made up that the action could be maintained would then briefly in an, a matter of second say this action can not be maintained.</text>

            <text syncTime="1636.382" offset="6545450">A Spanish National, resident of Spain on a Spanish flagged vessel, registered in Spain on a voyage from Spain out and returning to Spain under a contract or articles of agreement providing that in the event of injury his rights shall be governed by the Code Law of Spain and Spain only has Code Law, I say that the District Court cannot apply the General Admiralty Law to this man for the very reasons this Court said the Jones Act could not be applied in the Lauritzen against Larsen case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.689" offset="6730710">That the law of the flag prevails, that the man's contract with his employer must be respected and I say further as in that case, in this particular case, this man, this seaman, the law of Spain gives him adequate remedy and compels his employer, the Steamship Line, to ensure his rights under those remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.644" offset="6838544">This man, under Spanish Code Law, applying to Spanish seaman on Spanish flagged vessels, will receive for life and this is far more generous than most of our United States State Compensation Acts, will receive for life from between 35% and 50% of his wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.558" offset="6942198">He can have a hearing in the Compensation Courts in Spain which they refer to as a Labor Court and within that Compensation Court or Labor Court he establishes that his employer, the Steamship Line was negligent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.331" offset="7013251">His compensation can be increased, 50% for a life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.617" offset="7046374">Under another section of the Code Law of Spain his medical bills are paid by his employer's insurer as the same as our cure here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.567" offset="7118263">He is furnished maintenance the same as under American Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.350" offset="7137384">Under Spanish Law he has remedies identical with those of American seaman, except for an American seaman sues for a lump sum, Spanish seaman gets his compensation right and maybe far better off because he never has to prove negligence to get the original 35-50%.</text>

            <text syncTime="1813.089" offset="7252323">It is far older that our compensation, any compensation act we have in this country and has existed for many, many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.829" offset="7291298">On the assertion that the Spanish Line did not pay the hospital bills for this man I want to say briefly on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.533" offset="7338109">Garcia &amp; Diaz, the agents for the Spanish Line, it all appears in the record, all this is in the record, informed St. Mary's Hospital in Hoboken as well as the attending physician that their bills would be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.707" offset="7394743">About June 11, the attending physician advised Garcia &amp; Diaz, the agents here, that this man could leave the hospital, was well enough to leave the hospital and enquiry was made of him, is he in sufficient condition to repatriate to Spain?</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.747" offset="7470916">Now it was the duty of the Spanish Line to take this seaman out of the port of the United Station and if it didn't, be fined to thousand dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.386" offset="7497456">They come in on a 29-day leave; they must leave with their vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.880" offset="7515429">But if they're injured they can stay here till they are ready to leave, but then it's incumbent on the employer to take them out of the port, that's why the enquiry was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.457" offset="7553776">The surgeon attending the man in the hospital said yes, he is fit to travel to Spain, particularly because we had aboard this as Mr. Axtell says modern two-year old steamship with all winches from Denmark on it, which is not the fact, there is nothing in the record it, but it was very modern new ship; it had a ship surgeon on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.194" offset="7644682">And this defendant Compania through its agent tendered the man repatriation and this defendant through its agent Garcia paid the doctor his bill to that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.155" offset="7708526">And informed the doctor that it could not commit its principal Compania to any further medical charges, it had no authority to do it and should it do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.571" offset="7754188">And its employer has to pay, it would be highly questionable whether Compania could be reimbursed to those by its insurer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.634" offset="7786475">And Spanish Line informed St. Mary's Hospital to the same effect and asked St. Mary's Hospital for a bill to June 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.844" offset="7827331">They send a bill to June 14; we asked them again for a bill to June 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.423" offset="7845616">This agent here had to pay a bill to June 11, had to account to its principal and had to hand proper papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.402" offset="7877590">And on the trial this action before Judge Sugerman the hospital was again told that if it would submit a bill to proper date the bill would be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.526" offset="7926073">This defendant Compania has furnished maintenance and has furnished cure and the record discloses it has through the National Insurance on Spain setup the pension of this man for life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.360" offset="8001411">That has been established, it awaits him, he has been tendered repatriation, but if it any time he wanted his compensation he did not have to go to Spain because it's in the record clearly that he could have gone up on 5th Avenue, I think it's New York City to the Spanish Consulate asked for his compensation and asked for a hearing on it and get a certification from a doctor and he would have been furnished his compensation, Spanish compensation here in the United States, he did not have to return to Spain for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.150" offset="8136516">Now as to the position of Compania with respect to the Jones Act and the General Admiralty Law, this Court decided in the Lauritzen case that that Danish seaman could not maintain suit under the Jones Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.518" offset="8209972">That case did not involved General Admiralty Law, only the Jones Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.054" offset="8228153">And the only difference between the Lauritzen case and the present case on the Jones Act is one, the accident in the Lauritzen case happened in Cuba, the accident in this case happened in Hoboken, New Jersey and a port of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.002" offset="8307984">I say that everything this Court said in Lauritzen and denying that man Larson, the right to man -- to stay in suit under the Jones Act applies equally and fully to this man and of the place of accident has no bearing on the decision of the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.278" offset="8401084">If this man could maintain suit under the Jones Act as this Court has pointed out in the Lauritzen case as to Larson, if this vessel or any Spanish vessel, the vessel of any nation called at 20 different countries on a voyage or 10 different countries and every point it entered, it would be subjected to a different Workmen's Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.767" offset="8491050">It would be compensation, and in many of the ports injury to a workman involves penalties and sometimes imprisonment if the negligence by the (Inaudible) is semi-criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.390" offset="8549460">If it's what we would call gross negligence, they would call in some countries criminal and a man could be put in jail for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.757" offset="8578926">But every port this vessel would go into, this employer would be subjected to different law and in the Lauritzen case this Court said that should not be.</text>

            <text syncTime="2325.562" offset="9302204">And when the La Follette Act was amended, that was 1950 and amended in 1920, they then called it the Jones Act and as I say it broadened liability, didn't create any new plaintiffs, any new defendants but wiped out more of the fellow-servant doctrine.</text>

            <text syncTime="3247.606" offset="12990380">May it please the Court, I represent Quin Lumber Company who is the fourth named defendant in this action and was one of the respondents in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.826" offset="13035207">The question of law that was presented to the United States District Court in which thereafter was presented to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and which is presented to this Court is whether the district court as a court of limited jurisdiction by virtue of Congress enacting Sections 1331 and 1332 of the Title 28 of the Judicial Code could have heard this case on the merits and have determined liability or the absence of liability on the civil or law side of the court where the plaintiff insisted on staying and on which side of the court and only on which side of the court, he has the right to trial by jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.470" offset="13233842">Now I say that for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.087" offset="13244291">At the conclusion of the pretrial hearings by Judge Sugarman in which he sought the jurisdictional facts as to whether he had the inherent right to hear this case on the law side of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.362" offset="13309388">He gave two plaintiffs' counsel, the opportunity to have the whole case, transferred to the admiralty side of the court where he as the trier of the facts could have heard the case without the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.271" offset="13369051">The plaintiff through counsel refused to be transferred to the admiralty side where he had no right to trial by jury and therefore Judge Sugarman dismissed the case since he found on all the causes of action which had been set forth in the complaint that he had no jurisdiction over the subject matter which was before him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.179" offset="13456614">And this question of humanitarian quality which missed a point he raised in his opening argument to this Court might indicate to this Court that by virtue of the dismissal and the affirmance of the dismissal, this plaintiff is without a remedy even in our American courts and I think that is a disingenuous argument for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.616" offset="13550446">After the complaint had been dismissed or after the affirmance of the dismissal, this plaintiff as was his right, instituted an action in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, in New York County suing the exact four defendants that he has here, alleging in four causes of action, the identical facts which he has alleged in this case, so that at this point of the proceeding he is not out of court, as far as the American courts are concerned, but that doesn't determine the issue that was presented to Judge Sugarman.</text>

            <text syncTime="3433.701" offset="13734766">He could have done so as far as I see because this was not adjudication on the merits, but what this plaintiff wanted throughout the entire case is to have in one lawsuit the four defendants whom he says are the tortfeasors so that he doesn't stand in the position of having to try his case as against one, two, or three and they are pointing to the fourth defendant who is being suited in another court, solely by himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.129" offset="13840509">He wanted to try his case as against the four defendants at one time in one court and he invoked the jurisdiction of the District Court on the law side setting for in his complaint four causes of action; the first one of which was directed against Spanish Line and Garcia &amp; Diaz under the Jones Act and under the General Maritime law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.284" offset="13941133">The second cause of action sought wages to the end of the voyage and maintenance and cure and again was directed as again the Spanish Line and Garcia &amp; Diaz.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.871" offset="13987422">The third cause of action was directed against International Terminal Operating Company and said that there was diversity of citizenship between plaintiff and defendant and the court has jurisdiction under the General Maritime Law and the fourth cause of action was identical, but only it was directed against my client Quin Lumber Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.402" offset="14069551">Now the plaintiff in opening to this Court said he used the magic words that he was suing under the Jones Act and that brings to the fore I think the argument that I make on behalf of Quin Lumber in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.037" offset="14128065">If a plaintiff can merely in his complaint say I am a seaman and I am suing you defendant A under the Jones Act and if the District Court by virtue of that allegation and that allegation alone is precluded from enquiring into the jurisdictional facts as to whether the Jones Act applies to this seaman, then I say by such an allegation even though it defaults the plaintiff has vested jurisdiction upon the District Court and as I understand the law, you don't vest jurisdiction on a court of limited jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="3745.855" offset="14983419">It has been urged here Your Honor, It's urged here in this respect that if Your Honors say that there never was jurisdiction under the Jones Act because the jurisdictional facts show that there wasn't, a Jones Act suit here, then you must get to the next question and the next question is nonetheless could you have brought this suit as a Spanish alien against the Spanish alien and three American citizens in the Federal Court on the civil side because this being a Maritime tort, a Maritime tort is a case which arises under the Constitution and then the third question is if there was no good lawsuit to begin with in so far as a Jones Act suit or the other and I respectfully submit that there couldn't be pendent jurisdiction which is urged here because pendent jurisdiction by it's very nature presupposes a good jurisdiction to begin with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3798.487" offset="15193861">If you have no Jones Act jurisdiction in that, he never could have asserted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3802.393" offset="15209535">Although there is a sham allegation all the Jones Act sued against this defendant and if you don't have jurisdiction under the lowest constitutions then you don't have pendent jurisdiction at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3814.579" offset="15258227">And I think that roughly is the position that I took in the courts throughout the Jones Act suit and I might indicate to Mr. Justice Whitaker the reason that Judge Sugarman went into the question on management, control and operation, all this vessel and so far and Garcia &amp; Diaz was concerned is he had to determine since the plaintiff in the first cause of action had asserted a Jones Act suit against Spanish Line and Garcia &amp; Diaz, he had to determine whether conceivably Garcia &amp; Diaz was the employer of this particular man so that he could have asserted a Jones Act suit as against Garcia &amp; Diaz in contrast to Spanish Line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3854.417" offset="15417574">He found that under the facts that were presented to him, Garcia &amp; Diaz was not the employer of the plaintiff, therefore could not be sued under the Jones Act and under the McAlister case which he cited in his decision which this court handed down some time ago, he said that therefore there is no Jones Act suit that could be brought against Garcia &amp; Diaz and that's why he took the evidence in so far as the relationship between Spanish Line and Garcia &amp; Diaz to determine whether conceivably Garcia &amp; Diaz was the employer by virtue of contractual arrangements or as approved that was in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3890.016" offset="15559993">I respectfully submit having invoked the jurisdiction of a court of limited jurisdiction, this plaintiff had to sustain it and he didn't sustain it by virtue of the facts that had been found by Judge Sugarman and which have been affirmed by the Second Circuit on an expression on the workman like opinion of the court below and the treaty question which was raised in Second Circuit has been disposed off in that plaintiff withdrew it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3916.276" offset="15665006">So that there is represent to Your Honors report questions that I have presented in my brief on behalf of Quin Lumber Co. and which I respectfully submit dictate and affirm to what has taken place here.</text>

            <text syncTime="4009.976" offset="16039811">In order to try this action – it was originally instituted in the District Court of New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="4014.860" offset="16059350">And there he succeeded in getting jurisdiction over the persons of three of the defendants and not my client, because my client didn't do business in New Jersey and therefore could not be sued and process could not be served there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4026.977" offset="16107833">He then came over here to New York and he sued originally the three defendants in that he had two companion actions going on, one in New Jersey and one in the Southern District of New York and then not being able to get jurisdiction over my client in New Jersey he served an amended complaint with process issuing out of District Court which added my client for the first time in the Southern District of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="4049.156" offset="16196545">And when he added it, he alleged, as he has alleged it against every other defendant a separate cause of action, but I respectfully submit to Your Honor he has a cause of action for personal injures against many defendants, but the basis of jurisdiction have been set for as separate causes of action but that doesn't save him.</text>

            <text syncTime="4074.876" offset="16299468">Your Honor this case has been a very hard fought case, not only on the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4082.464" offset="16329770">A statement was made here by Mr. Quinlan that he has been furnished with maintenance and cure, Mr. Remero hasn't a received a Nickel.</text>
            <text syncTime="4092.127" offset="16368431">The statement was also made that all he has to do is go up to Spanish consulate and get in workman's compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4098.745" offset="16394971">There is a letter which has been filed here which my client received in which he is told by the Spanish Line that all they need is a doctor's report and he will get his workman's compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4111.265" offset="16445022">It's a fact that the captain and the surgeon of this ship went to the Hospital at St. Mary's had attempted to get him out of the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="4123.006" offset="16491938">They tell us to save themselves from a fine, that's what they tell us.</text>
            <text syncTime="4128.028" offset="16512104">But their background is, if you get them in, in fact to stay, he never comes back here to sue and the case is finished.</text>
            <text syncTime="4135.595" offset="16542302">That technique has been used by other steamship companies; they get these people out of the country and quick.</text>
            <text syncTime="4144.348" offset="16577306">Then the last point, they speak about the hospital here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4150.765" offset="16603011">It has not been paid, we all know that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4154.478" offset="16617848">Now the question has been made that -- a point has been made about the contract that it was signed individually.</text>
            <text syncTime="4161.144" offset="16644493">This contract was not signed individually for this trip; there was no contract for this trip.</text>
            <text syncTime="4167.837" offset="16671347">There was a round trip contract two voyages before this accident and a contract said right on top round trip contract, when he gets back to Bilbao, finished and he came over to more trips.</text>
            <text syncTime="4184.305" offset="16737176">Yet, we're led to believe that he signed a contract in Bilbao when he took this trip.</text>
            <text syncTime="4190.679" offset="16762671">Now as to the Larsen case, I would like to point out that there is this very important language where the court said at page 1224, we do not think the place of contract is substantial influence in the choice between competing laws to govern a maritime tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="4216.500" offset="16865907">Since the accident in the Larsen case occurred in the Port of Havana, Cuba we conclude that the accident in the case at bar having occurred in the territory of United States, the rule of lex loci delicti commissi will govern for the court, said in the Larsen case and this is very important in last quotation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4235.332" offset="16941244">On 1291, place of the Wrongful act, the solution most commonly accepted as to torts in our municipal and in international law is to apply to law of the place, with the act giving right to the liability occur, the lex loci delicti commissi.</text>
            <text syncTime="4255.876" offset="17023478">This rule of locality often applied to maritime torts would indicate application of law of Cuba, the accident happened in Cuba and whose domain the accident took the place.</text>
            <text syncTime="4268.011" offset="17071961">In our case the accident happened in the Hoboken, New Jersey, the United States waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="4274.166" offset="17096620">And then the last point we have had here I think a little presentation here on what the Jones Act is.</text>
            <text syncTime="4285.417" offset="17141656">The Seamen's Act was passed in 1915.</text>
            <text syncTime="4288.974" offset="17155866">As Mr. Quinlan stated that was -- law was written to promote and help American Seamen, but the Jones Act which was in 1920, which was a separate act and where the provision Section 33 appears, which amends Section 20 which was knocked down by the (Inaudible) decision, that Section 20 -- Section 33 exist both in the Jones Act and it also exists in the Seamen's Act, it has a dual existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4326.505" offset="17306018">And in the Jones Act we have a different legislative intent and I'm reading now from Page 61 of the petitioner's brief on the merits, which reads from the policy -- from the policy of the Jones Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4348.619" offset="17394416">I'm reading in the middle of the page and it is hereby declared to be the policy of the United States to do whatever may be necessary to develop and encourage the maintenance of such a Merchant Marine.</text>
            <text syncTime="4361.520" offset="17446034">And then you'll find here in this brief a discussion of the legislative committee hearings, where they wanted to equalize the course of the American Merchant Marine, they want to save the American Merchant Marine.</text>
            <text syncTime="4375.584" offset="17502250">And yet today by the action of the Spanish Line in not paying its hospitals bill, and not sending any money to the seamen, not offering an artificial limb, just say come back to the Spain or go to your Spanish Counsel, we won't do anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="4391.409" offset="17565571">The Spanish Line is saving money.</text>
            <text syncTime="4395.619" offset="17582393">Not only that they've got to appoint where on St. Mary's Hospital they say fine the man stay there till January, beside we're going to pay till July 14th.</text>
            <text syncTime="4404.953" offset="17619801">Who has to pay for the balance?</text>
            <text syncTime="4407.262" offset="17628996">Saint Mary's Hospital and they're the ones who are going to suffer, not the steamship company.</text>
            <text syncTime="4413.227" offset="17652820">So these foreign steamship companies are taking advantage and thus our Merchant Marine today is going down further and further and I just want to make one last statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4427.991" offset="17711961">In the New York Law Journal there appeared a decision, just recently dealing with the taxi cabs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4438.769" offset="17755011">Apparently they are now using a device in New York, where a man will have a 150 taxi cabs and he puts two cabs to each corporation that way he limits his liability on two cabs to each cooperation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4451.605" offset="17806420">There's been a great healing try because the taxi cabs companies only have 5,000 to 10,000 liabilities, whereas the individual had 10,000 to 20,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="4461.058" offset="17844140">They are going to do something about it, but yet we have today, where many steamship companies have one ship or one co-operation, nobody has done anything about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4469.649" offset="17878518">It's the old story of the public being aroused and may be this case can solve this whole dilemma.</text>
            <text syncTime="4476.160" offset="17904640">Thank you.</text>
