          </turn>
          <turn speaker="j_r_goldthwaite_jr" startTime="121.257" stopTime="681.527">
            <label>Mr. J. R. Goldthwaite, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="121.257" offset="484937">That's first time sir we've had that case brought to our attention at all and didn't find any so ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.000" offset="523912">The House Bill 3020 in 1947 in Section 10A specifically provided that an individual, an employee whose right to work during a strike was infringed would have a right to bring a suit in a, any court of competent jurisdiction, as I recall, the words, venerated, provided a court remedy for interference with the right to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.116" offset="648464">The Conference Committee of the house and Senate specifically rejected the house proposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.963" offset="683781">And in lieu of the house proposal to provide a court remedy for the same type conducts involved in this case provided the amendment to Section 7 which guaranteed the right to work and provided Section 8 (b) (1), given the National Labor Relation Board jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.871" offset="767478">Therefore we think it's pretty, it's quite clear from the Congressional history that Congress specifically rejected the right to bring a legal action to enforce the rights involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.297" offset="833097">Therefore, if we are correct and we are quite sure under the rulings of the Court which held that the board has the authority to grant any relief it deems necessary -- any remedial relief it deems necessary to effectuate the policies of the act, the board does have that power.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.910" offset="927556">Therefore, necessarily the remedy provided by the National Labor Relations Act is in direct conflict with the remedy provided by the state court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.579" offset="974263">And therein as Mr. Justice Douglas asked about the Laburnum case yesterday, therein lies the distinction we believe between this case and the Laburnum case.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.266" offset="1037061">The Laburnum case was a case of an employer whose lawful right to conduct his business free from interference was interfered with by violent conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.885" offset="1087530">The Court there held that there was no parallel remedy provided by the National Labor Relations Act to redress the injury which was the subject matter of that suit and that of course is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.086" offset="1152313">The National Labor Relations Act makes no attempt whatsoever to guarantee the right of an employee to conduct his business.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.358" offset="1185332">There is no guarantees which parallel to the employer, the guarantees afforded to the right of an employee to work and that I think is a primary distinction between Laburnum and the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.145" offset="1264536">We do believe that the Laburnum case, if it were before the Court for decision again would probably be decided differently because the adjudication by the State Court in that case necessarily involves the adjudication of concerted -- of the right of employees to engage in concerted activity and the extent of the -- exercise of that right is a matter which has been given to the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.204" offset="1380728">At any rate we think that the Laburnum case carries the, to the fullest extent the line of demarcation within which the state can act upon the subject matter which has been covered by the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.865" offset="1467455">Mr. Justice Frankfurter in the Weber case I think very clearly pointed out that it was necessary that the National Labor Relations Act provide a damage suit remedy before the remedies would be in conflict but that -- he said that if there was an administrative remedy which is clearly provided in this case then the Weber case -- in the Weber case instead of the Laburnum case that the Court would have decided it different.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.273" offset="1593051">Well here there is a remedy provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.878" offset="1615412">Secondly, we do not think that a mere allegation of violence in State Court pleadings gives to the state a hunting license to use any regulatory or take any regulatory measure, measures that if it sees fit or that its courts see fit or that a state court jury shall see fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.733" offset="1758877">In other words a mere allegation in pleadings that violence is being committed doesn't open the door for the court -- for the state to take any action it sees fit upon the subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.549" offset="1822093">To the contrary this Court has pointed out repeatedly that the Congress intended and I think the Congressional history shows it, that Congress intended that within the sphere of the National Labor Relations Board's authority Congress intended to leave only to the states, the exercise of the function to maintain public peace and order.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.755" offset="1927001">The Congressional history shows that pretty clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.248" offset="1940898">Senator Taft said that only insofar as the actual violence in the commission was concerned did the two -- did the act overlap state remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.086" offset="2004323">So we don't think, we don't contend that the act replaces the state's injunction power or its authority to regulate -- to enforce its criminal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.203" offset="2068793">But there is a limit within which that power of the state to maintain public peace and order in an emergency maybe exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.170" offset="2120620">The decision of the Court we think illustrate that only to the extent it is necessary to maintain public peace and order may the power be exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.890" offset="2179553">The power may not be exercised beyond what is necessary to accomplish that purpose and Mr. Justice Brennan asked about the Rainfair case, I think the Rainfair case illustrates that exactly.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.401" offset="2233574">There the court, the state enjoined all picketing and the court very clearly know that only to the extent that it was necessary to control the injunction -- the violence did -- could the state exercise the injunctive remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.752" offset="2318942">In the (Inaudible) case the same case was, the same thing was true.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.906" offset="2339527">That was an exercise of the police power of the state to maintain public peace and order.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.211" offset="2376829">Now beyond the necessity of that exercise, the Congressional history indicates that Congress' original intention to maintain uniformity of regulation would be carried forward and getting back to Mr. Justice Frankfurter's question of yesterday, which I'm afraid I misunderstood, with reference to the punitive damages, I understood him to ask as to whether we felt it was a federal question for -- here for the Court to decide whether those damages were excessive, but I'm advised that I misunderstood the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.789" offset="2563135">The question at any rate I think possibly you asked if -- do we contend that whether or not the punitive damage feature raises a federal question, involves a federal question, we definitely do.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.122" offset="2624470">The power to inflict enormous punitive damages is the power to prohibit, the power -- in a strike where several thousands workers are involved for instance, and say 200 suits of this character are filed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1348.091" offset="5392300">It has about 550 employees, production employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.412" offset="5417587">On the morning this particular strike began which was July the 18th 1951, the plaintiff left his home to go to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.222" offset="5452800">He testified that he had no knowledge there was to be a strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.233" offset="5468891">He took his lunch with him as was his custom to eat in the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.046" offset="5492088">He got to the vicinity of the plant, and saw a picket line there of some 25 or 30 men walking in a circle about three feet apart over the entire travel portion of the street, off to the south side of the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.539" offset="5570142">Immediately adjacent to that picket line there was another group of strikers variously estimated at from 100 to 200 and over on the other side of the street, another group estimated to be about 50.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.758" offset="5642971">There were people scattered along in the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.350" offset="5653316">The plaintiff had to approach the picket line slowly on account of those small groups of persons in the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.581" offset="5682260">As he neared the picket line one of the union members who happened to be a picket captain by the name of Hobes (Inaudible) grabbed his automobile and was dragged by it some 10 or 15 to 20 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.580" offset="5742237">The plaintiff stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.548" offset="5750178">The Regional Director of this union from Atlanta who was there supervising the picketing and both he was there, the Assistant Regional Director, an international representative from Birmingham, they were all there participating in the picketing and supervising.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.311" offset="5821231">The Regional Director came up to the side of the plaintiff's car and said hourly or salary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.940" offset="5851742">Now we also had evidence of a man that attended the union meeting the day before when they were making the plans for this strike, that this international representative told them to let the salaried employees in but not to let the hourly paid production employees through the picket line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.601" offset="5926348">This Regional Director asked him as I said hourly or salary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.597" offset="5946305">The plaintiff replied what difference does it make?</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.644" offset="5958531">The Regional Director then identified himself as being the Regional Director and says if you are salaried you can go on in if you are hourly this is as far as you can go.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.240" offset="6008895">The plaintiff remained there from an hour-and-a-half to two hours there with (Inaudible), with that picket line in front of him he tried to go through it, each time he did, they would stop right in front of his car and point their signs down towards his car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.618" offset="6074410">Once he tried to edge in behind an empty bus going into the plant to pick up some third shift employees, and as he did so, the pickets surged over in front of him, someone of them shouted it looks like we are going to have turn him over to get rid of him and from that group that was congregated at the south side of the picket line which was constantly replacing the pickets and reinforcing them, shouts came of turn him over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.787" offset="6203141">The plaintiff testified that there after remaining there that length of time he was satisfied that he couldn't get into the plant without running over somebody or else getting turned over, so he backed out and went home.</text>

            <text syncTime="1628.737" offset="6514939">He said that under normal conditions if they were going to shut the plant down that they would start emptying that furnace some time around three or three-and-a-half hours before the shutdown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.362" offset="6561437">This morning they started emptying that furnace at 7:30 in the morning which was 30 minutes before the first shift was to get into work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.509" offset="6601979">He also testified that the draw benches and all the machinery of the plant were left in their normal and customary condition, the same they would be if the plant was to be operated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.733" offset="6654851">Now the union contended that they had an agreement with the management of the plant that if they had a strike the management would not allow the hourly paid employees in the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.375" offset="6705424">That was denied by the management representative and that was the main question argued and submitted to the jury and decided by the jury and there is no question in this record but what the case was submitted to the jury on that basis to determine the facts and that they were bound to have determined that force and violence prevented the plaintiff from earning wages and that he would have earned wages if he had been able to get in.</text>

            <text syncTime="1991.949" offset="7967765">Instead it placed the Laburnum case on the border ground that the Taft-Hartley Act did not operate to abolish common law tort actions, that they survived, and the Court mentioned that in passing it, Congress was insisting on increased responsibilities for labor organizations, and that it was inconsistent with the congressional intent, to say that by implication and without mentioning it, they abolished common law tort actions for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.592" offset="8118335">Now as I say I think the Laburnum case is controlling, the defendant said that Laburnum had no remedy, well Laburnum did have a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.613" offset="8166400">Under the statute and the decisions of this Court, Laburnum Construction Company in that case could have gone before the National Labor Relations Board and have complained of that conduct and obtained a cease-and-desist order from the National Labor Relations Board requiring the labor organization to cease-and-desist from that unlawful practice.</text>

            <text syncTime="2072.871" offset="8291474">It said that there is no compensatory remedy provided by the Labor Management Relations Act except I believe the wording was in such manner supplementary ways as reinstatement with back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.042" offset="8348108">Now I'm going to discuss that feature of the Laburnum case in just a few minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.594" offset="8382276">Before I get to that, I want to mention the Kohler case and the case of Youngdahl against Rainfair which the Court decided this week.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.547" offset="8438178">They hold, the Kohler case in considerable detail that Congress intended to leave to the states, the matter of controlling and preventing of violence in labor relations matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.793" offset="8499096">The Kohler case went so far as to hold that the Wisconsin Board and the Wisconsin courts could grant remedy, a preventive remedy that would duplicate that the board grants or could grant rather.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.081" offset="8572238">So they established without any controversy that, that power is still inherent in the states that is the power the control force and violence in labor relations matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.512" offset="8637962">Now, I think this action can be justified under that theory, that is under the power of the state to control force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.083" offset="8696268">I'm afraid that the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Douglas will not agree on this theory that I've advanced now in view of that dissent in the Rainfair case and in the Kohler case, but the Kohler case establishes as I said that the state does have power to prevent force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.559" offset="8810162">Let's think of the ways in which they can do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.959" offset="8823745">Of course the most obvious way is on the spot police protection; that is as was done in this case by the Alabama Highway Patrolmen and the city policemen that were there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.586" offset="8878289">Then the next way that the state can do it is by an injunction to enjoin the unlawful conduct, such as was granted in the Kohler case and such as was granted and sustained in the Rainfair case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.878" offset="8943491">As Mr. Justice Frankfurter said in the Metamora Dairies case, a state can places confidence in a Chancellor's decree rather than in a policemen's club.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.852" offset="8995318">So under the Taft-Hartley Act, as well as under the Fourteenth Amendment, this Court has held that the state can place its confidence in Chancellor's decree and an injunction properly framed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.077" offset="9052264">Now another way that the state can prevent force and violence in such matters is by criminal prosection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.076" offset="9088209">In Alabama we have a criminal statute providing that it's a misdemeanor for any person or group of persons to assemble at or near the entrance of a place of business for the purpose of preventing anyone from engaging in a lawful occupation by force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.544" offset="9162083">I think a number of states have similar laws, I know the Arkansas statute which was before this Court in the case of Cole against Arkansas, 338 U.S. 345, made it a felony for two or more persons to conspire to use force or violence to prevent employees from working, and this Court upheld the constitutionality of that statute, as I say it made it a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.813" offset="9279216">Well the legislative history of the Taft-Hartley Act makes it clear that Congress intended that the states retain that power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.246" offset="9324983">Now a criminal prosecution of course is -- serves or it operates in two ways; first it's for punishment and second it's to set an example, so as to prevent that unlawful conduct in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.993" offset="9391961">Now accumulative damages operate in the same way under our law and I think it's the law of practically all of the states, that allow punitive damages, they serve a two-fold purpose; one punishment, two to set an example, to deter similar conduct in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.443" offset="9477747">So I submit to the Court that the state has judicial power to allow the maintenance of an action such as this with the recovery of punitive damages, for punishment and to set that example in order to prevent that type of conduct and I submit this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.655" offset="9570534">It's a much more effective preventive remedy than a criminal prosecution of several hundred persons for misdemeanor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.449" offset="9621734">So we submit that under that power of the states that this action can be maintained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.007" offset="9668023">On that punitive damages there is one case decided by this Court that I didn't cite in my brief, I probably should have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.728" offset="9698847">In Alabama under Lord Campbell's Act otherwise known as the Alabama Homicide Act the only damages recoverable are punitive damages and no compensatory damages are recoverable on their law in a civil action for wrongful death, but it's solely punitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.577" offset="9782230">In 1927 that statute was before this Court in the case of Louis Pizitz Dry Goods Company, Inc. versus Yeldell 274 U.S. 112.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.619" offset="9838446">It was claimed that that statute violated the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.994" offset="9859971">Mr. Justice Stone held otherwise and said that the punitive damage was reasonably related to preventing homicide and that the legislature of Alabama had the right to attempt to prevent homicide by making it expensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.554" offset="9934158">We say that the state of Alabama has the right to prevent mass picketing and forcing violence by making it expensive as well as the right to prohibit it by its criminal laws and by its police officers and by the injunctive powers of the court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2592.343" offset="10369358">And the trial judge in that opinion said that he thought the jury had been exceeding the liberal, but he couldn't say that it had been actuated by improper motives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.582" offset="10418260">Now I thought that he would have approved any more than that because he didn't seem to be too sure of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.532" offset="10462041">Now to me the most difficult question in this case is what is the power of the National Labor Relations Board?</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.731" offset="10506867">The petitioners contend that they have power to require the union to reimburse Russell for the wages that he lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.725" offset="10550857">I don't know whether they contend that they had power to compensate him for the mental anguish he suffered on that, they haven't said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.139" offset="10588473">But certainly that is beyond the scope of the power of the board and the ordinary concept of that power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.583" offset="10638315">The basis of the power of the board of course is in the language of the act that it shall have power to require of a person to take such affirmative action as may effectuate the policy of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.679" offset="10702681">I believe that's the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.356" offset="10717414">Now petitioners claim that it would effectuate the policy of the act to require the union to reimburse the man for the wages he lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.202" offset="10760777">The board has held in at least four and I believe more cases that we cite in a footnote, footnote 23 on the bottom of page 47 of that brief that that they do not have that power, that there was no intention on the part of the Congress to have that power.</text>

            <text syncTime="2724.648" offset="10898495">That's right, that's what they hold and they mention the fact that under the 1935 act that it was held that they had the power to require the employer to pay back pay and that when the act was amended in 1947 that it used exactly the same language, but added the proviso that the board had power to require labor organization to pay back pay in cases of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.972" offset="11027853">And they said that adopting the language of the 35 act and adding that one thing showed that there was not a Congressional intent to give that power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.918" offset="11075605">Now I say that there is more evidence of Congressional intent that the board not have that power than appears from the language of the act and that is from what was said when this amendment was being considered in the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.563" offset="11146240">We quote in our brief one illustration Senator Taft gave.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.238" offset="11172885">He was asked by one of the senators what procedure the board would adopt on an unfair labor practice under Section 8(b)(1) and I read from what Senator Taft said, it's set out at the beginning at the bottom 49 of my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.094" offset="11248327">He said this, “There will be a hearing as to why they were doing these things and a cease-and-desist order maybe issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.456" offset="11289809">So far as I know there is no other penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.137" offset="11304542">If they should disobey the cease-and-desist order, the board can obtain an injunction and if they violate the injunction they are liable for contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.822" offset="11347278">That is the only result” and I emphasis on it, that is the only result of this general charge of unfair labor practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.124" offset="11388447">Now I have another instance during the debate on that, Senator Taft illustrated by supposing a case of mass picketing and he again mentions mass picketing that keeps office personnel out of the plant and he says that the board can call the union before it and issue a cease-and-desist order, but that is the only consequence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.640" offset="11506521">I believe that with Senator Taft's knowledge of this situation and with his candor and frankness that if there had been any intention on the part of the Senate to give the board that power that he would have so answered in response to those inquiries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.127" offset="11592411">I think secondly that it was never in his thought that board was being given that type of power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.831" offset="11623236">Now another indication is that when they were discussing Section 303 of the act which is the provision I believe allowing for secondary boycotts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.117" offset="11668376">Senator Taft says that it was discussed giving that power to the board, rather than for providing actions of law to recover damages, the secondary boycotts, but he said no one either side of the question thought that the board was a proper agency to have power to grant damages in a case like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.701" offset="11762730">So I believe that the Congressional intent and I submit to this Court that the Congressional intent was that the board would not have power in such cases like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.617" offset="11822393">There is another very strong evidence that Congress intended to leave that matter to court and that is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.653" offset="11862518">My friend Mr. Goldthwaite has mentioned that in the house bill which was known HR 3020 Section 12 (a) of that bill authorized or provided rather that it was an unlawful concerted activity for a labor union by force or violence to prevent anyone from entering his place of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.099" offset="11972336">Subdivision (b) of Section 12 of that bill expressively provided that anyone injured by such an unlawful concerted activity would have the right to maintain a suit for damages in the United States District Court without regard to the amount in controversy or the citizenship of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.593" offset="12074318">Now that was the house treatment of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.612" offset="12090410">When the Senate disagreed and the matter got to the Conference Committee, they adopted the Senate version of the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.648" offset="12134504">They dropped Section 12 of the house bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.143" offset="12152477">They explained why that was done and in the explanation, that is in the House Conference Report, in House Conference Report of 510 on page 42.</text>

            <text syncTime="3144.278" offset="12577019">Furthermore in Section 302(b) unions are made suable, unions that engage in these practices to the injury of another may subject themselves to liability under ordinary principles of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3184.934" offset="12739709">It happened that 302(b) was the corresponding provision in the house bill and I think the (Inaudible) has confused on the section, but whether that is material or not at least what they are saying is then since unions are suable, they can be subjected to liability for common law torts such as this under ordinary principles of law and I submit to the court that that shows an intention on the part of Congress that actions such as these survive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.293" offset="12877113">Now my adversary in his reply brief says that statement of the Conference Report I just read as meaningless because of the reference to 302(b), and says that 301 of the act has reference to suits against labor organizations for violation of contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.483" offset="12969900">That's true of Section 301(a) but the conference report shows that the rest of Section 301 of the act was of general application.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.463" offset="13021832">In the legislative history set out by Mr. Justice Frankfurter in his dissent in the Textile Workers Union case against Lincoln Mills of Alabama a part of the Conference Committee Report reads as follows, talking about Section 301 of the conference committee bill, “This subsection and the succeeding sub sections of the Section 301 of the conference agreement are generally in their application as distinguished from sub section (a), they are general in their application.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.312" offset="13189224">Bearing that out Mr. Justice Frankfurter said in that dissent, and this is from page 933 of 77 Supreme Court of Florida, the statement in Section 301(b) that the acts of the agent of the union are to be regarded as binding upon the union maybe used in support of this conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.207" offset="13276787">This provision not confined in its application to suits in the District Court under Section 301(a) was primarily directed to responsibility of the union for its agents actions in authorizing strikes or committing torts, recognizing that the other provisions of Section 301, the provision rather than (a), are of general application.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.068" offset="13392248">Now going back to the Laburnum case, it was pointed out there that there was no compensatory remedy for the Laburnum Construction Corporation provided by the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.696" offset="13462779">Now if the words giving the board power to require a person to take such a affirmative action as well effectuate the policies of the act, can be construed broadly enough to say that the board had power to require the union to compensate this plaintiff, for his loss of wages and for his mental suffering.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.356" offset="13569358">Then by the same token in the Laburnum case, when the Laburnum Construction Corporation went to the board and asked that the union be restrained from preventing their employees from working, the board then could require the union to take affirmative action by paying Laburnum the damages they had sustained, but the Court didn't seem to think that board had such power and said, that it had compensatory power and only minor supplementary wages.</text>

            <text syncTime="3470.817" offset="13883246">The answer I have for that goes back to what I have been arguing that Congress intended that common law of tort action survives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.244" offset="13920967">Now – and in that connection I want to mention a line of cases that I probably should have, but haven't mentioned in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.711" offset="13954821">They are referred to by the Supreme Court of Alabama in its original consideration of this jurisdictional question in 53 and that line of cases are the ones dealing with Railway Labor Act, Moore against Illinois Central Railway and Slocum against Delaware, and Lackawanna Railway Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.082" offset="14056281">As I read those cases, the injured party has an election as to whether he will proceed before the board or whether he would proceed in a court and here is what was said in the Slocum against Delaware and Lackawanna Railway Company case which is quoted by the Supreme Court of Alabama and I'll read from page 6, 7, and 8 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.732" offset="14158890">“Our holding here is not inconsistent with our holding in Moore against Illinois Central Railroad Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.662" offset="14186580">Moore was discharged by the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.606" offset="14198387">He could have challenged the validity of his discharge before the board, seeking reinstatement and back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.791" offset="14227122">Instead he chose to accept the railroad's action in discharging him as final, thereby ceasing to be an employee, and brought suit claiming damages for breach of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.905" offset="14279576">As we there held, the Railway Labor Act does not bar courts from adjudicating such cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.513" offset="14309982">A common-law or statutory action for wrongful discharge differs from any remedy which the board has power to provide, and does not involve questions of future relations between the railroad and its other employees.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.273" offset="14377064">Now the effect of that is that a railroad worker who is discharged can go for the board and seek the reinstatement and back pay or he can file a suit for damages for wrongful discharge.</text>

            <text syncTime="4093.817" offset="16375223">Your Honor I like to briefly call your attention to item one is that the provisions of 302, 301(b) refer merely to the fact that a labor organization can be sued as an entity in the court of United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4114.973" offset="16459860">It creates no right of action and the fact as Mr. Harris said that Congress said they treated the subject matter covered by Section 12 of house bill 302(a) or 302(o) with reference to suits by employees effectively, well the treatment they did in that was effective was by putting the amendment to Section 7 and providing Section 8(b) indicating clearly their intention to divorce that power on the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="4150.782" offset="16603115">The many reports say that – well for one the house report says under this clause the board may also require a union to reimburse an employee who loses -- it causes to lose pay the amount that he loses.</text>
            <text syncTime="4169.500" offset="16677930">Now that was quote on house 302(o) on Section 8(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="4177.287" offset="16709068">So they said there that the board did have that power.</text>
            <text syncTime="4181.743" offset="16726936">Now I want to try to express an idea that a comment by justice -- Mr. Justice Frankfurter raised this and that is apparently the idea that I've heard other people express that the mere existence or well I say an allegation, but let's say the actual -- the existence of force and violence is itself the criterion or the determining factor as to whether the state can have jurisdiction or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4218.277" offset="16873012">If it were the criterion, the sole criterion as Mr. Harris urges, that when that exists they can do anything, well then Rainfair would have been decided differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="4230.525" offset="16922018">If they could -- if the force and violence was there, it gave them (Inaudible) jurisdiction to do anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="4237.213" offset="16948767">They could have enjoined all of the victims.</text>
            <text syncTime="4240.715" offset="16962769">The same thing is true of the Garner case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4243.353" offset="16973322">If under that theory violence has been involved in the Garner case, then I think the Court -- and that was the criterion, then the Court would have said that the state could enjoin violations of Section 8(b)(4).</text>

            <text syncTime="4258.782" offset="17035076">Why do we have to choose one or the other?</text>
            <text syncTime="4261.113" offset="17044376">Just as merely because of -- there is violence it doesn't preclude peaceful activity so because those peaceful activities doesn't prohibit the inhibition, the prohibition of violence.</text>

            <text syncTime="4275.502" offset="17101949">That proves the statement I was making I think sir that violence itself is not the criterion for opening the door for any state action in a case.</text>

            <text syncTime="4288.217" offset="17152836">But does it open the door (Inaudible) to establishing the fact that there was violence in a state court and if that is established, that damages maybe assessed by the state court according to its local procedure and measure -- and laws of damage whether punitive or not, some states have (Inaudible), doesn't it -- if there is violence open the door to a cause of action on the basis of violence.</text>
