            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">Number 32, United States of America on a relation of Lee Kum Hoy, et al., Petitioners, versus John L. Murff, District Director of the Immigration and Naturalization Services.</text>

            <label>Mr. Benjamin Gim</label>
            <text syncTime="27.429" offset="109714">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.689" offset="118700">This case is here on certiorari to the Second Circuit and involves a question of whether the Immigration Service made lawfully imposed blood test on Chinese alone and not on other persons in cases involving claims to writ their citizenship based on a relationship to the citizen parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.404" offset="205531">The District Court found that unlawful racial discrimination had been practiced against the petitioners and sustained the writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.866" offset="247432">The Circuit Court, Judge Frank dissenting, reversed this decision and judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.921" offset="279615">The petitioners, two boys and a girl being then at the ages of 22, 13, and 12, arrived in the United States at Ellis Island in June of 1952 seeking admission as citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.832" offset="347324">In July and August of 1952, they were blood tested twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.512" offset="369998">These two blood tests conflicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.790" offset="379089">The first blood test excluded all three petitioners as being the possible children of the citizen parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.267" offset="408973">The second blood test excluded two of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.248" offset="424960">On the bases of these conflicting blood tests, the Immigration Service ordered the exclusion of all three of the petitioners and incarcerated them in Ellis Island for a period of over two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.967" offset="479817">In a review of these proceedings before the District Court, Judge Dimock remanded the proceedings to the Immigration Service for a reopen hearing to allow cross-examination of the blood test technicians and to develop evidence on the issue of racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.935" offset="559647">At the reopened hearing, the Immigration Service refused to produce an official to testify on the policy of the service with regard to blood test.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.844" offset="599353">They also refused to produce facts and figures as to the number of Chinese blood tested and whites if any.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.648" offset="626521">The service position at that time was that the issue of racial discrimination had no possible bearing on the decision of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.847" offset="659331">Notwithstanding, the refusal of the Immigration Service to produce an official to testify on the policy of blood test, the petitioners went ahead and proved that the blood test program commenced with the sending of a circular at the direction of the Immigration Service to the public health authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.395" offset="741564">This circular directed blood testing of Chinese persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.501" offset="757969">It did not specify blood test for any other nationality.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.216" offset="780852">The Public Health Service doctor testified that pursuant to this circular, he conducted 200 blood tests that all the persons tested were Chinese and that he never tested a white person.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.104" offset="840411">Then beginning June of 1953, the Immigration Service discontinued using the Public Health Service to conduct these tests and turn the matter over to private experts such as Dr. Leon Sussman.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.332" offset="901224">Now Dr. Sussman testified that he conducted 300 blood tests at the request of the Immigration Service that all 300 of the persons tested were Chinese and that he never had occasion to blood test a non-Chinese.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.566" offset="966217">Then both of these doctors testified at the hearing that these two blood tests were invalid and inaccurate and insufficient to form any conclusions as to paternity or non-paternity in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="298.837" offset="1195259">They were conflicting.</text>

            <text syncTime="308.519" offset="1234024">No, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.956" offset="1235801">They were done by a transfusionist in the Public Health Service and the doctor who supervised these blood tests himself refused to standby the conclusions of these tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.967" offset="1287837">When the matter went back to the District Court, the Government moved to dismiss the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.433" offset="1313646">The Government, contending that blood tests were not imposed on Chinese alone but were required of all persons who did not have birth certificates to prove their identity and relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.802" offset="1375190">Now, petitioners answered this argument by citing cases of Chinese who had birth certificates and who were nevertheless were blood tested.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.322" offset="1413224">Judge Dimock noted that these cases led in substance to the issue of racial discrimination and remanded the case to the immigration authorities for the second time for the specific purpose of developing evidence on the issue of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.202" offset="1480725">Now, this time at the second reopen hearing, the Immigration Service did produce a witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.963" offset="1499847">Now this witness was the very same attorney who had argued the prior proceedings before Judge Dimock.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.685" offset="1526700">This witness minimized for the first time a birth certificate matter as a -- any factor in determining whether or not a blood test would be needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.582" offset="1570273">He stated that the most important factor in determining whether a blood test was required in any particular case was whether or not the citizenship claimant was born in an area which was accessible to an investigation by the American consul.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.462" offset="1633802">He said that if the American consul could investigate the area of the person's claim birth and ascertain from his neighbors and relatives and local government officials his identity and relationship, there would be no need for a blood test.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.048" offset="1700153">He went on to say that this was seldom true in Chinese cases that all the Chinese applicants were born in the remote interiors of China and they were inaccessible or rather the areas of their birth were inaccessible to a consul investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.457" offset="1761802">However, on cross-examination, this witness, although he conceded that the consular investigation factor was a long standing factor in determining whether blood test would be needed, this witness conceded that in all the prior proceedings before Judge Dimock, he had never once mentioned the factor of a consular investigation as being at all important in determining whether blood tests were necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.354" offset="1865352">At that time in those proceedings before Dimock -- Judge Dimock, the Government placed sole reliance on the birth certificate as the most important factor in determining whether blood test would be needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.679" offset="1918642">Now on further cross-examination, this witness who appeared as the Immigration Service expert on the policy insofar as on discrimination, this witness was unable to cite a single case from the beginning of the blood test where a white person had ever been required to take a blood test.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.507" offset="1997949">He was also unable to cite a single case of a Chinese who was ever exempted from the blood test.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.228" offset="2032849">Then these witnesses also forced to admit that the operation instructions of the Immigration Service did at one time contain a specific direction to blood test Chinese but this witness refused to produce these instructions for the examination of consul.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.106" offset="2104424">This witness even refused to summarize the language of these operations and instructions.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="533.492" offset="2133891">On what grounds do you do that?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="benjamin_gim" startTime="535.593" stopTime="1064.310">
            <label>Mr. Benjamin Gim</label>
            <text syncTime="535.593" offset="2142354">This witness stated that the Government instructions were confidential and to review it would be prejudicial, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.227" offset="2176836">Petitioners went ahead to prove their contention that Chinese, all Chinese, regardless of whether or not they have birth certificates and regardless of whether or not they were born in areas which were accessible to consular investigation, were always required to take a blood test and other persons never were.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.693" offset="2258756">The form of proof which the petitioners introduced consisted of several cases of Chinese infants who were born in the British territory of Hong Kong.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.085" offset="2300238">None of these infants exceeded the age of six.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.747" offset="2314971">Each one of these infants had never been to China.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.013" offset="2328033">They were born in the British territory of Hong Kong.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.046" offset="2340153">In addition, each one of these infants had a British government birth certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.005" offset="2363977">His parents had British marriage certificates.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.793" offset="2375158">In one of these cases, the American consul himself had issued a birth certificate for the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.354" offset="2401384">And most important, there is a large American consul staff in Hong Kong and these applicants were thoroughly investigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.816" offset="2435239">Nevertheless, each one of these children, two of them being only one-and-a-half years of age were required to take a blood test.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.732" offset="2474841">Now, on the face of this record, Judge Dimock found that the policy of the Immigration Service was to blood test all Chinese and no whites and he sustained the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.525" offset="2522070">Now, the Circuit Court with Judge Frank dissenting conceded that the petitioners in this case had proved that there were 500 cases of Chinese blood testing.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.720" offset="2566792">That there were no cases of Chinese exemptions and that there was no evidence of any white person blood tested.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.973" offset="2595840">But the Circuit Court reasoned that the petitioners had failed to prove discrimination because they have failed to prove that the Immigration Service officials were actuated by an evil motive or conscious racial prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.586" offset="2658325">This Court granted certiorari limited to the sole issue of racial -- whether or not racial discrimination was practiced in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.103" offset="2712346">Now, petitioners submit that the factual issue tried administratively and reviewed by the District Court was whether in fact all Chinese were blood tested or whether the blood test extended to white persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.566" offset="2774204">The Government itself put this issue in question by contending that blood tests were not restricted to Chinese but were applied to all persons without birth certificates.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.233" offset="2820911">Then the Government later changed this position and claimed that blood tests were imposed on all persons, Chinese and non-Chinese alike who were born in areas which were not accessible to an investigation by the American consul.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.303" offset="2877127">The petitioners submit that we have shown that these two excuses advanced by the Government for blood testing Chinese only are really inconsistent and tardy afterthoughts.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.618" offset="2930416">We think further that the citation of the several cases of blood testing of Hong Kong Chinese infants who have birth certificates and who are accessible to a consular investigation prove that no Chinese were ever exempted from the blood test.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.141" offset="3000529">Now this is the record which this Court is asked to review.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.901" offset="3015576">Namely, whether or not, the blood tests were extended to white persons or whether or not the blood tests were confined and restricted to Chinese.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.357" offset="3061342">On this posture of the record, it is submitted that Judge Dimock's finding that there was racial discrimination is imminently correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.496" offset="3105959">Now, after the Government lost this case before Judge Dimock and after Judge Dimock had entered a judgement for the petitioners, the Government for the first time moved in a motion for reargument claiming on a basis of an ex parte affidavit that beginning in 1955, 60 white persons had been blood tested.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.037" offset="3204075">Now, petitioners submit that the evidence of blood testing of white persons in 1955, the petitioners themselves being blood tested in 1952, the evidence of blood testing of white persons in 1955 if that be so does not absolve retroactively a discriminatory practice imposed upon Chinese in 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.191" offset="3308669">Moreover, the actual citation of the 60 white person blood tested in 1955 actually lend support to the proof of discrimination in this case because if there were reason to blood test 60 white persons in 1955, surely there were reason -- similar reasons existed for blood testing whites in 1952, in 1953 and 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.535" offset="3410129">And yet in all these years, despite the reasons for demanding a blood test, the Immigration Service could not show any examples of white persons blood tested in those years.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.493" offset="3465927">Now, the Government argues in its brief that well beginning 1955, especially after Judge Dimock had condemned racial discrimination in blood testing Chinese beginning 1955, we reformed and there is no reason to exclude the discriminatory blood test in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.088" offset="3552340">Petitioners submit that the -- this case is controlled by the procedures in effect in 1952 and the subsequent repentance by the Government in blood testing white persons in 1955 does not retroactively cure any discrimination in blood testing Chinese in 1952.</text>

            <text syncTime="948.000" offset="3791935">Now, at -- at this late stage, the Government has shifted its ground again and has advanced another justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.979" offset="3827879">Now this justification comes in the form of a consular report -- it's apparently unclassified and the author of the report and the date of the report is not clear but this report purports to recite a high incidence of fraud among Chinese persons and the Government argues that from this report which is replete with dubious generalities and racial insinuations that blood testing is somewhat justified on a reasonable basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="1141.142" offset="4564532">This was attacked at the second hearing by counsel for the petitioners and on cross-examination they extracted some of the testimony which counsel has referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.955" offset="4611762">The hearing examiner, special inquiry officer, found that on the basis of this test, they could not be the children of the alleged parent and the Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed that holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.772" offset="4675082">There is no holding by the District Court with respect to that, to that fact.</text>

            <label>Mr. John F. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="1613.818" offset="6455171">It was because the immigration authorities were satisfied on the evidence that they were citizens without the necessity of blood testing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.335" offset="6481293">It wasn't only on birth certificates presumably.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.950" offset="6491742">It was on the records as I know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.024" offset="6508042">But it is our position here that there are very special circumstances which are applicable because of the attempts of many persons in a position similar to that of these petitioners to come into the country illegally and that therefore special precautions against this type of fraud were necessary in this type of situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.259" offset="6617025">Historically, there has always been resentment by the Chinese against the American Immigration Policy arising particularly from the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.264" offset="6677002">And historically, the Chinese who are normally law abiding citizens have felt no compulsion against gaining entry into this country by fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.033" offset="6736039">And actually, relying upon the destruction of the birth records in San Francisco at the time of the San Francisco fire, enough persons of Chinese ancestry claimed to have been born in the United States so that if all of their claims were true, each Chinese women legally in the United States who have to had to have given birth to 800 Chinese in order to make that to permit this number of people to begin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.658" offset="6870622">The repeal of the Exclusion Act in 1943 has not really helped the situation very much.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.416" offset="6901656">The quota for Chinese is 105 persons a year and so the pressure for admittance continues to be very great.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.820" offset="6947213">On the other hand, the opportunity of checking the voracity of applicants for entry of citizens is small.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.384" offset="6985456">Customarily, they claim that they come from rural sections of China where there are no birth records and in fact they frequently present no written evidence of any kind as it was true in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.800" offset="7043135">Since the communist have taken over the mainland of China, there's no opportunity at all to make a field check in the places where the applicants claim that they were born.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.576" offset="7102276">Difficulties in language and in translation, in the customs, and the Chinese calendar as against our calendar, the names, all make it difficult to check or to detect fabrication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.408" offset="7161626">And then there is one other feature which makes it particularly difficult and that is the customary pattern of citizens of Chinese ancestry returning to China to marry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.772" offset="7239053">There were fewer Chinese women in this country than Chinese men because of the early history and because of the Exclusion Act and so it became customary for American citizens of Chinese ancestry to return to China to marry, remained a year or two and since their wives could not return with them, they'll come back to the country and perhaps make repeated trips back to China to see their wives and families.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.603" offset="7342393">And then as the children grew old enough, the children would then apply for admission as American citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.113" offset="7376353">Their wives wouldn't -- their wives wouldn't be an American citizen and couldn't come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.129" offset="7392444">The children would be American citizens by derivation and would be admissible as citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.194" offset="7420761">Now, this makes a great difficulty in determining the bona fides of the applications and the immigration officials and the state department people who had to issue passports and travel documents in China became convinced that much of the evidence which was being produced in many of the applicants who were appearing before them were not genuine, and that there was a tremendous fraud being -- being operated through filling the possible vacancies that the people who were claimed to have been born with other individuals who wished to come to this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.123" offset="7604454">And so, it was that in 1951, the State Department instituted a program requiring a blood check in order to determine whether or not an applicant was in fact the son of the father whom as he claimed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.538" offset="7682090">The -- the program turned up a great number of cases in which the applicant was not the child of the alleged father and the immigration people then undertook the same type of program when the applicants knock for admission at the door here in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.743" offset="7782922">And as it was in 1952, just about the time that these petitioners came to New York that the Immigration Service commenced the program of -- of requiring blood test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.938" offset="7843736">And because of this history which I have given you, it was not -- it's not strange that the -- where they started this program, where they actually made these requirements was in the case of Chinese because it was in the case of Chinese that we have these peculiar circumstances of tremendous pressure for inference and this readymade opportunity for fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.991" offset="7939866">Now, at the present time, this program is not in any way limited to Chinese.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.768" offset="7967033">There are no instructions, there are no regulations that require it to be applied to Chinese particularly and it is, in fact, applied across the Board to any applicants where paternity is an issue and where this type of testing is appropriate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2092.606" offset="8370364">He was cross-examined with respect to these cases and it seems possible that two of them seems probable indeed that two of them may have been Negroes if that has been of importance.</text>

            <text syncTime="3021.720" offset="12086857">Now, the Court also said on page 47 that these -- that the trial court did, the pieces of blood test reports are clouded in inaccuracies and shrouded mystery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.163" offset="12160627">Now, Mr. Davis with commendable candor admitted that at the time the petitioners had blood test in this case, the practice was to ask all Chinese to take blood test and that these blood tests were not extending to other people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.382" offset="12225515">I only regret that the Government counsel below did not have the same degree of candor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.089" offset="12248294">Now, on page 15, this is the pleadings which the Government set in joint issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.815" offset="12279223">The petitioner charged that blood tests were administered discriminatorily against Chinese only and this is what the Government said in its return.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.142" offset="12312555">This is on page 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.600" offset="12318302">While it is true that such blood grouping test have been requested principally in Chinese cases, these relaters have not been singled out for unusual treatment since such test are uniformly now requested of all applicants for admission who are similarly situated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.984" offset="12399909">Now Mr. Davis cites in response to Mr. Chief Justice Warren's question as to whether any Chinese were exempted, Mr. Davis said that there were 50 Chinese exempted and I think what Mr. Davis is referring to is page 99 which is the ex parte government affidavits submitted after the decision was in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.794" offset="12483082">I would like to draw the Court's attention to the fact that on these 40 cases, rather 50 -- the latest date of the admission is June 16, 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.017" offset="12528013">This is obviously before the blood test program commenced and obviously that 40 Chinese were admitted before the blood test program commenced is totally irrelevant and is no showing that any Chinese were exempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.303" offset="12585169">I think more significant, however, is that after the decision was in and after the Government took the trouble to dredge up the statistics which they had maintained all along, there were none.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.854" offset="12631353">They have failed to show any cases after June, after the petitioners in this case were blood tested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.914" offset="12655595">They have failed to show a single case of a Chinese exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.682" offset="12666671">I think that is more significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.173" offset="12680673">Now, Mr. Davis also mentioned that there's a great difficulty in these case because the Chinese make a habit of going back and be getting shown abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.605" offset="12726335">Now, on our -- in our reply affidavit on page 8, we have pointed out that the Chinese are not alone in this practice for instance in -- from the immigration annual report of 1954, foreign-born children from Italy, numbered 2,736 as compared to only 336 from China.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.704" offset="12850782">Now, a passing comment on this Hong Kong report that I -- the petitioners submit that the Court may not take judicial notice of it because it's not an official published report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.490" offset="12893936">It apparently was classified at one time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.870" offset="12907416">It certainly disputable, it was never made accessible to the public.</text>
