            <text syncTime="26.595" offset="106371">This is the case of Willie B. Moore who was sentenced on October 29th, 1938 to life imprisonment in the County of Kalamazoo, Michigan and the sentence was on -- after a plea of guilty to a charge of murder of a lady named Josie Zeedyke.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.035" offset="180140">Mr. Moore, in the 1940s, filed his own papers with the Circuit Court for the County of Kalamazoo.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.751" offset="218906">Sometime later, he was represented in escort in three separate hearings on a delayed motion for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.657" offset="250567">After that, Mr. Moore was out of money.His father is a blind man.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.958" offset="275749">His mother is sick.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.104" offset="284317">The Circuit Court appointed me as the attorney for Mr. Moore to attempt the perfected field with the Supreme Court of the State of Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.718" offset="318798">Subsequently, the Supreme Court denied -- the delayed motion denied the -- granted the appeal but denied the delayed motion for the new trial in a 5-to-3 decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.706" offset="362789">And subsequently, this Court has appointed me to represent him at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.211" offset="388807">Now, in arguing this case and looking into this case, we have one barrier which is difficult to overcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.735" offset="430916">That is before the De Meerleer case in our Circuit in Kalamazoo.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.050" offset="448157">There was no court reporter of any of the questioning or of any of the procedure that went on at the time of the -- what we call the arraignment, in finding out whether the man needed counsel, whether he could afford counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.670" offset="506671">And I think that's been -- I haven't found that that is in question by the Court at any time but I wish it's pointed out to the Court since I submit that that makes the rate of the problem as to equality of the evidence which is brought before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.374" offset="577411">The evidence as to what happened at the arraignment is simply the testimony of two or three or four casual witnesses and Mr. (Inaudible) the lawyer who just happened to be in the court and Mr. Zeedyke, son of the murdered lady.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.239" offset="640940">And it raises a difficult problem on appeal which would never have occurred at this time.</text>

            <text syncTime="524.804" offset="2099200">In this case, he was not taken before the magistrate.And he was a young man and fully educated and a literate.</text>

            <text syncTime="538.231" offset="2152908">Here it seems to me is the important point.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.046" offset="2168163">There is on the record the statement by the judge that he was satisfied that the plea was freely and involuntarily made and we don't question that the judge said that.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.613" offset="2198361">But at that time, he didn't know what had happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.541" offset="2210064">And we didn't know what had happened until at 1950 or 1951 when Sheriff Struble who was the sheriff at the time of Willie Moore's arraignment and arrest, when Sheriff Struble testified before the -- the Circuit Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.615" offset="2274429">And when he was asked what did he say to Mr. Moore, to the 17-year-old fellow, he said, “It is my duty, and it is up to me to protect you, to use every effort at my command to protect you, but, I says, “the tension is high out there and I am just telling you what could happen if it was started by someone.”</text>
            <text syncTime="586.813" offset="2347154">I don't know the language I used.”</text>
            <text syncTime="589.114" offset="2356454">Then he goes on to say, “I don't know as I come out and said at any time for him to plead one way or another, but what I was putting over to him was the fact that if you are guilty and will be sent away, you might better be getting away before trouble, because I had had information that there were certain colored fellows, a group of them, that was going to interfere with me, and also that there was a bunch of Holland fellows going to meet me when I go to Jackson, they would meet me there at Galesburg there, and, therefore, when he was sentenced, I avoided the main route and went way through by Gull Lake and across over in the hills.”</text>
            <text syncTime="622.445" offset="2489678">Now what you may say yourself well, that wouldn't seem to affect me.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.282" offset="2517055">I wouldn't plead guilty to a crime just because the sheriff said that.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.945" offset="2535758">But we contend that the effect on Mr. Moore was just as he said.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.597" offset="2558328">“After the man tell me he couldn't protect me then there was nothing -- then there wasn't nothing I could do.</text>

            <text syncTime="679.928" offset="2719660">And during the time of his incarceration in this questioning, he was not allowed to permit his relatives or his friends and he did not in fact permit them or -- or contact them.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.440" offset="2765740">And that also is undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.964" offset="2775771">There is no question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.341" offset="2785280">And further, he was without counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.697" offset="2798759">And there is some evidence in this hearing that counsel was mentioned to him but it's undisputed of course that he was without the benefit of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.779" offset="2835017">He was in an isolated cell.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.643" offset="2850482">Its -- I see now in the brief first which was furnished to me by the people that they have pictures of the -- the prison showing that you couldn't get up, this particular spot.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.461" offset="2901786">However, it's submitted that Mr. Moore has indicated the people that were there were brought up as visitors and that they pounded on the cell, on his cell that evening and they -- they threatened him and they shouted.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.343" offset="2953300">And in particular, one said, “Well, let's get him now and I'll get it over with.”</text>
            <text syncTime="746.364" offset="2985378">And that then is when this hammering started on the door up there.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.429" offset="3001678">And I submit that that was occurring on until the fear in Mr. Moore from the time -- right onto to the time on Saturday morning when -- when he pleaded guilty and he was sent to prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.737" offset="3058939">And further undisputed on the record, I submit are the -- that the prosecutor and members of the police promised him a shorter sentence if he should plead guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.503" offset="3101989">Now, next, and I think running into the same thing is and the same facts are applicable was the fact the counsel was not appointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.453" offset="3133753">This is as capital offenses as -- as we have in Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.515" offset="3145979">Obviously, we don't have a death sentence but we do have this murder in the first degree which is mandatory life and the man goes to prison for life, forever, there is no parole, no pardon, perhaps there's pardon but there's no parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.807" offset="3211180">So this is a serious case.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.330" offset="3217241">This is as serious as you can get.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.598" offset="3226331">He was 17 years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.257" offset="3233019">He had a seventh-grade education.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.604" offset="3242318">There's a lot of evidence, a lot of testimony in the record that try to show that he was an experienced criminal and where -- where the evidence came that he had four or five difficulties with the -- with the police, I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.616" offset="3302400">However, if -- if that's true, if that's what he told the judge, then they -- they were juvenile offenses and they were not record offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.937" offset="3339703">And the only offense which is shown in the record is the offense some two weeks before in Grand Rapids when he pleaded guilty to unlawfully driving away a car.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.325" offset="3377215">And the evidence shows in that case that the contact between the Police Officer, Mr. Cole and -- was between him and (Inaudible) said he was the father of Willie Moore he was mixed up by that.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.901" offset="3427579">It was between him and the mother and we just asked the mother, “Do you think you ought to have a lawyer for him?”</text>

            <text syncTime="1119.415" offset="4477597">I -- I pray that this Court does not decide the case on those -- on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.749" offset="4494942">First is, they decided on whether or not this man was guilty or innocent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.218" offset="4516780">I was appointed by the Court not to determine a guilt or innocence of this man and this Court, I'm sure, is well aware that that's not the question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.631" offset="4550426">The question is where -- was he granted his constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.598" offset="4566309">The second thing which the Supreme Court said is that it's difficult to get evidence to have a trial after 17 years have elapsed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.006" offset="4599954">Again, I submit that's not relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.050" offset="4612180">And then finally, the -- the Court says we're worried about the possible consequences of returning to society, a person likely to increase the public burden of sex crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.065" offset="4656170">Again, I submit to the Court that that is the reason why this case is here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.612" offset="4674351">If this Court is so far away from -- quite a waste away from our tribunal and that is because of the fact that it should not be decided on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.525" offset="4710087">It should be decided not on difficulty of proof or the burden on society but whether or not this man was granted his constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.770" offset="4743001">And that -- the -- Mr. Shepherd who was a former -- former Solicitor General from Michigan was a little worried about this thing too and his response to our petition, he said it is the testimony of the former Sheriff that troubles somewhat for a word unqualified or if it showed beyond doubt that this officer, that is Sheriff Struble, by threats of my violence so and still the petitioner was here that he was induced to confess and plead guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.564" offset="4842162">The position of the State might prove untenable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.428" offset="4853656">Now, he did not admit error there, he just -- and -- and he wanted this to come before this Court, as I understand it, to see whether it was shown that the threats of my violence, the statements to this man were sufficient.</text>

            <text syncTime="1264.333" offset="5057306">I regret to announce that Mr. Shepherd, my predecessor retired this June, after many long years before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.787" offset="5091056">He was paying many tributes when he retired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.658" offset="5102550">But I think the one that he cherished most was the one that you paid him last year in the Butler case where you expressed your appreciation of his candor before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.691" offset="5146749">I hope that when I retire, and I will have earned the same accolade from this Court because I really feel that these quick justice cases are the kind that disturbed everybody.</text>

            <text syncTime="1305.212" offset="5220833">He pleads guilty to under a very serious crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.519" offset="5233998">He's not represented by an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.686" offset="5242671">I started to say without benefit of attorney but that's my view upon waiting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.456" offset="5261793">But anyhow, he's not represented by an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.232" offset="5272869">And it causes all of us a lot of concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.744" offset="5286975">I was concerned about it when I got the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.936" offset="5299722">And I started very carefully.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.730" offset="5306828">I even went to Kalamazoo to look at the jail and I included the picture of the jail here for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.968" offset="5331801">I wanted you to see what type of jail this man was confined in by the time he entered his plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.806" offset="5359177">And if you will notice, it's a rather massive pile of brick and marble.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.162" offset="5380598">It was built in 1937 on WPA funds partly and is used as a federal jail also.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.750" offset="5414975">And the cells, the solitary cell which is referred here is not a solitary cell alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.070" offset="5440261">It's solitary in the sense that it's all to this side but there is a door, an iron door that leads to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.984" offset="5467847">And then there is another door outside that's made of iron.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.195" offset="5480699">And when I saw this cell, it was brightly lit up, you could see into it and there was an intoxicated man who had been confined there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.642" offset="5514553">That's the kind of a cell that is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.770" offset="5523017">So when they speak about solitary cell here, they don't -- it doesn't mean solitary in the sense of putting some man down the hole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.216" offset="5552797">I also talked with Judge Fox.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.819" offset="5563246">I want to make sure that when he took the statement from Moore in this case, I want to see what type of a man he was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.101" offset="5596369">Well, he's an able and respected judge there in Kalamazoo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.723" offset="5606818">He was the assistant prosecutor who took the statement -- the statement here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.785" offset="5623118">And I asked him when he took the statement just what he thought on Willie Moore's condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.172" offset="5640673">And he said he thought the plea was free and voluntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.883" offset="5651435">He had no worries about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.680" offset="5658645">He was still convinced of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.925" offset="5663660">I talked to Mr. (Inaudible) who is still down there and to several other people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.714" offset="5686753">Well, after I saw that, I decided that we would oppose this motion and do the best we can here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.794" offset="5711099">Now, I'm glad of one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.008" offset="5723951">We will not have, I hope any more of Willie Moore case in Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.336" offset="5741296">We have revised our court rules and our statutes since that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.919" offset="5763657">Under the De Meerleer case within a month later, we revised our proceedings there, our court rules which hand of course substantial in our State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.229" offset="5804826">And that provided that when a man pleads guilty or offers to plead guilty, the court before accepting the plea has to advise him of his right to counsel and right to a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.879" offset="5851429">And then if -- if the man advised the court, he is unable to afford counsel then the court will appoint one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.151" offset="5880581">We've even gone so far now and I think further in most States, we've tried to find the suggestions made by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.451" offset="5909734">We allow a man to request an attorney at a preliminary examination now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.548" offset="5934184">I know that statute was just passed three months ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.843" offset="5943275">I've had a little trouble interpreting who the presiding judge would appoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.683" offset="5958635">I have to interpret that but there is no question now if a man comes at a preliminary examination in our State and request an attorney it will -- he will be appointed one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.441" offset="5997714">So we will not handle that State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.933" offset="6003670">We -- our State does not believe in depriving anybody of his rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.782" offset="6019030">I've been through the -- this procedure under Rule of 35-A many times in my job as an assistant prosecutor in Wayne County.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.124" offset="6056438">I know the exact procedure when the man said he wants to plead guilty, the judge stops the proceeding and says, "Do you want an attorney to represent you?"</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.215" offset="6088829">And if he said, "Yes."</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.150" offset="6092591">And he appoints an attorney for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.021" offset="6100010">And the record is made of a whole proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.714" offset="6106802">If a man pleads guilty, he's asked to plead guilty freely and voluntarily, he's asked if he's guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.246" offset="6132924">He's pleading guilty because he is guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.391" offset="6141492">He's asked of any threats or violence has been used on him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.985" offset="6155912">So we don't have that situation anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.164" offset="6164584">Thank the Lord.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.362" offset="6169391">And I hope we'll never have another one like this one.</text>
