            <text syncTime="16.580" offset="66247">Before -- Mr. Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.794" offset="87144">Before attempting to argue the -- to answer the argument of the counsel on the other side, I'd like to call the attention of the Court to our contention that the questions argued by petitioner are not properly before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.282" offset="185051">The only question in the Tax Court was whether the petitioner or the respondent rather, was a transferee of the assets of the estate of Milton J. Stern deceased.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.977" offset="255896">Now, that appears on page 4 of the record which is in the deficiency letter sent to Mrs. Stern, the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.017" offset="299990">And then, in the pleadings, in the petition, the answer and the reply the reference is made 25 times I believe it is to the liability of the respondent as transferee of the estate of the decedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.059" offset="388180">And that is what the Tax Court decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.825" offset="403226">If Your Honors will turn to page 16 of the record, it is argued and decided that the petitioner is liable as transferee of the estate of Milton J. Stern, deceased.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.705" offset="466756">Now, the argument has been addressed to the proposition of whether she is a transferee of the decedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.006" offset="503954">Of course, if these proceeds had been paid to the estate and turned over by the executor to Mrs. Stern, we've never would have gone into the Tax Court because necessarily, she would have been a transferee there of assets of the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.251" offset="580963">Another question which does not -- was not contended for in the Tax Court and wasn't raised there was the question with respect to the cash surrender values of the policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.705" offset="634776">The only question down below was whether or not she was liable for the proceeds of the insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.347" offset="669362">So on those two issues, we contend that those questions are not properly before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.401" offset="701544">I don't want to take too much time on that.</text>

            <text syncTime="200.994" offset="803944">Never any question presented the Tax Court as to whether she was a transferee of the decedent himself, and of course, there is an immense difference between being a transferee of the decedent and a transferee of the estate of the decedent.</text>

            <text syncTime="386.563" offset="1546240">Page 4 in the first paragraph, constituting your liability as transferee of assets to the estate of Milton J. Stern.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.568" offset="1590230">Now, most -- assuming the questions are probably before the Court, the Government's argument principally is predicated on the theory that there's the same kind of a transfer here as would be involved in the case of a estate tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.508" offset="1662015">If Your Honors care to turn to page 10 of our brief, we have set out there the sections of the estate tax law, which in our opinion clearly indicate that proceeds of insurance were not the property of the decedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.449" offset="1745711">For instance, 811 provides that the gross estates shall include all the value of all property at the time of the decedent's death.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.260" offset="1800986">Now, in 811 (a), to the extent of the interest therein of the decedent at the time of his death.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.084" offset="1828258">Now, that would be stocks or real estate or something he might own that would go to his heirs or to his executor.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.674" offset="1866606">Now, when you get down to the next sections about life insurance, it doesn't say anything about the interest of the decedent in the life insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.780" offset="1899102">It says to the extent of the amount receivable by all other beneficiaries as insurance showing that Congress in enacting the legislation never considered that the decedent had an -- a property interest in the proceeds of life insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.831" offset="1975275">If that -- if the Congress have so considered, it wouldn't have been necessary to have incorporated these two sections about proceeds going to this executor or proceeds going to any other beneficiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.112" offset="2024385">Now, Chief Justice Vinson, when he was on the Court of Appeals in the John Hancock Life Insurance case, wrote an opinion in which he pointed out the distinction I have quoted on page 11 of my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.570" offset="2082273">A paragraph of his opinion in which he shows that the statute has two lines he says.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.049" offset="2124173">One is the interest of the decedent with respect to property which he makes the transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.267" offset="2149042">The other is insurance which goes to the beneficiary and he states that the statute proceeds to impose a lien on the estate property to the extent of the decedent's interest at the time of transfer or to the extent of the beneficiary's interest under the insurance contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.842" offset="2239321">So it isn't necessary and this -- in the -- it's Chase National Bank case didn't hold that there was a transfer of life insurance proceeds from the decedent to the beneficiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.224" offset="2300865">In that case, the Court said, it was the termination of the power to control of the insured over the policy at the time of his death which rendered the proceeds includable in his gross estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.346" offset="2365336">Not because he owns the proceeds and by imperative reasoning not because he own the cash surrender values but because at his death, the power to change a beneficiary terminated and shifted the economic benefit of that policy into the hands of the beneficiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.294" offset="2445166">And that the Court said in the Chase National Bank case was the basis for the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.295" offset="2469094">Now, there are other cases where there are properties included in the gross estate which the decedent doesn't own a property in at the time of his death.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.661" offset="2526563">For instance, transfers in contemplation of death maybe made years before.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.483" offset="2553835">Revocable transfers and interests in joint tenancies or tenancies by the entireties.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.928" offset="2587690">They're all segregated in the estate tax law, separate and apart from the one section that refers to property in which the decedent has an interest showing that all kinds of properties may be included in the gross estates including life insurance proceeds with respect to which the decedent didn't own a property interest up to time of his death.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.107" offset="2688418">Now, then the Eight and the Ninth Circuits in two different cases each which I have cited on page 12 of the brief have held that the fact that there is a transfer rendering property includable in the gross estate at the time of death has nothing to do with the transferee liability and in income tax case.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.199" offset="2792699">And in fact, in that case, it was a tenancy by the entirety and joint tenancies and they said there wasn't any property interest that went to the survivor which constituted property under Section 311 of the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.239" offset="2872947">Now, the Government in its brief in a petition for certiorari admitted that they couldn't get certain property and the joint names of the decedent and its widow that is some bonds and some real estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.446" offset="2949747">Now, those properties were includable in the gross estate just same as insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.231" offset="2968869">So I don't see how there can be any distinction between properties of that kind and life insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.164" offset="2996558">As a matter of fact, life insurance is -- policy is a contract where the insured pays a premium in consideration for the payment of proceeds to his beneficiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.189" offset="3056744">As soon as that policy is signed, the insurance company is liable for the full amount if the insured dies the next day which demonstrates, we think that when the insurance company pays the proceeds, the insurance company pays its own money and it doesn't pay anything that belongs to the insured.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.934" offset="3147651">Now, as Justice Harlan this morning pointed out all five Circuit Courts of Appeals which are passive on this question have held that there's no transfer of proceeds and there's been no Circuit Court of Appeals that's held of the contrary.</text>

            <text syncTime="900.444" offset="3601763">And I would say further there's no evidence whatever in the case as to whether the insured paid any premium from these policies during the taxable years 1944 to 1947, or after that -- after the date of his death.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.310" offset="3669159">And as to all of that, the Government has a burden of proof under Section 1119 (a) because the Government has a burden of proving transferee liability and the burden is not on the taxpayer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1623.349" offset="6493309">Now, they argue that by analogy, you can go to the transferee section under estate tax law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.537" offset="6526119">Well, the transferee section in the estate tax and the income tax law both originated in 1926.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.884" offset="6555481">They read exactly the same way except in income tax, it said that the property of the taxpayer and the other said property of the decedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.366" offset="6593411">Now, in 1918, was the first time that life insurance is brought into the estate tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.191" offset="6620682">And in the same law, they made the beneficiary of the policy personally liable for the tax to the extent of the proceeds produced the estate tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.701" offset="6686720">Now, that was 1918.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.138" offset="6696542">In 1926, the transferee provision in both sections of the law were put into effect, and it was not until 1942 that Congress amended the estate tax section and brought in a beneficiary of an insurance policy although that beneficiary had been liable all these years from 1918 and of course in 1926 where the transferee section was first enacted They amended the law and made the beneficiary subject to the summary process of assessment, but that amendment did not make the beneficiary viable for the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.556" offset="6874175">The beneficiary is already liable under the former section and here under 827 (b), the beneficiary is liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.289" offset="6909074">So, we say and as the Court of Appeals in the Rowen case in New York said, the fact that Congress didn't changed the law in the income tax showed that Congress didn't intend to produce the same result that they did in the estate tax when they did amend the law.</text>
