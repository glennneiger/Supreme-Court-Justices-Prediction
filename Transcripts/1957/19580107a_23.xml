        <section startTime="0" stopTime="1749.824">
          <heading>Argument of J. Thomason Phelps</heading>
          <turn speaker="j_thomason_phelps" startTime="0.000" stopTime="710.568">
            <label>Mr. J. Thomason Phelps</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court?</text>
            <text syncTime="13.267" offset="52976">With the Court's permission I should like to take approximately half of the appellant's time to open and my colleague Judge McKeage would like to have the remaining time for rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.879" offset="131448">This is an appeal from a judgment of a three-judge district court for the Northern District of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.611" offset="174393">That judgment declared unconstitutional a statute of the State of California and permanently enjoined the Public Utilities Commission, the appellant here, from taking any action to carry out the terms of that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.101" offset="264359">This case presents two major aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.894" offset="283481">The first is one I may call a preliminary or threshold or jurisdictional question, involving the question of whether or not the district court should have entertained the complaint and then second is what I may call the ultimate question, which is whether or not the State of California, through the commission, had the power to regulate the rates of commercial carriers for the transpiration of property of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.825" offset="451291">This matter had its inception in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.035" offset="476056">In order to make clear a number of questions that arise under this preliminary aspect of the case, I should like to describe as briefly as I can the statutory and administrative framework under which commercial carriers are regulated by the commission in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.463" offset="585770">For our present purposes and in order to simplify the matter, I think we may consider carriers in California as in two categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.148" offset="632581">In the one, we have the rails and the so called certificated motor carriers which are operating under certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by the commission and we can call these the public utility carriers, because under California law they are public utilities for all purposes of that law.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.047" offset="736131">They are required to file tariffs and with certain exceptions they are required to assess and collect no other than that tariff rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.594" offset="786286">In the other category, there are, what you may call permit carriers, they are so called in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.653" offset="810527">There are thousands of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.781" offset="815020">They operate under mere permits issued by the commission and their rates are regulated in California by certain minimum rate orders promulgated by the commission from time to time.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.177" offset="876669">So that these permit carriers are required to assess no less than these minimum rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.491" offset="917943">Now although we have these categories of carrier, and they are regulated somewhat differently, they compete with each other vigorously for all kinds of traffic, including the traffic of the United States government.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.563" offset="978233">For many years it's been the commission's policy to equalize the conditions under which these two classes of carriers compete with one another.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.425" offset="1033613">For many years prior to 1955, Section 530 of the Public Utilities Code, any provision the effect of which was to grant to these public utility carriers an unlimited right to transport property of the United States and other governments, free or at reduced rates, a provision comparable to Section 22 of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.120" offset="1192438">Now in order to give the permit carrier the same privilege the commission, a number of years ago, incorporated in certain of its minimum rate orders, a provision authorizing these permit carriers to deviate from the minimum rates, for the transportation of property for the armed forces, that's very important, to bear in mind that limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.594" offset="1358367">That provision was Item 20 in Minimum Rate Tariff number 2, promulgated by the commission applicable to general commodities, not all but so called general commodities.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.643" offset="1446557">Now in 1954, a group of carriers, who had been transporting large quantities of property for the United States government, filed with the commission a petition and that is where this matter had its inception.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.494" offset="1533910">That petition alleged that due to the intense competition of carriers for government business, the rates for that business had deteriorated to the point where the revenues of the carriers were depressed to unreasonably low levels and there was a threat of a burden upon other traffic, that petitioner requested the commission to take appropriate action.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.129" offset="1668493">The action that these carriers requested of the commission was the cancellation of that Item 20 provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.795" offset="1719171">Later by amendment that request was modified into a request merely that the commission authorized permit carriers to deviate from the minimum rates only to meet the rate of a public utility carrier that had been filed with the -- some agency of the United States government in order to give the permit carriers the benefit of knowledge of what these other rates were.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.775" offset="1859082">The commission found as facts substantially all of the allegations of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.489" offset="1893878">The remedy which the commission sought to accomplish, however, was a remedy which required the cooperation of the United States government and by cooperation I mean the commission's order contemplated that the United States government would require these public utility carriers to file with the commission, simply for the sake of giving publicity these reduced rate tenders which they had filed with various agencies of the United States government.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.065" offset="2080183">So the commission's action and its proposed remedy was conditioned upon that action by the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.491" offset="2117904">Later on the commission was formally advised that the United States government had declined to require the publishing and the filing of these reduced rate tenders with the commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.443" offset="2185718">The commission's attempt to remedy therefore became a futility.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.777" offset="2211004">In the middle of 1955, therefore, the California legislature enacted an amendment to Section 530 of Public Utilities Code, the effect of which was to withdraw from the public utility carriers, this previously enjoyed unlimited right to transport for the government free or at reduced rates and empowered the commission to permit such transportation, upon such terms and conditions as it saw fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.155" offset="2384562">There was, however, an important proviso attached to that amendment, a proviso that had the effect of partially restoring its privilege so to speak to the utility carriers in order to enable them to meet whatever reduced rate might be authorized to the permit carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.770" offset="2510994">That amendment was to become effective on September 7th 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.125" offset="2536490">Now on August 16th 1955 the commission in anticipation of that September 7th date and realizing that the statute would be defeated in large measure unless and until the commission canceled this Item 20 provision to the permit carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.236" offset="2640875">On August 16th the commission issued a decision which canceled Item 20.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.089" offset="2680268">Ten days later on August 26th at a time, and this is important, when the commission's action canceling that privilege to the permit carriers could have been stayed by the United States until its rights had been finally determined by this Court, instead it acquiesced in the commission's cancelation of that privilege and merely requested a postponement of 90 days of its effect.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="710.568" offset="2842227">May I ask you what way of acquiesce -- just by asking for a continuance of that is what you mean or do it express acquiescence (Inaudible) --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="j_thomason_phelps" startTime="721.272" stopTime="820.420">
            <label>Mr. J. Thomason Phelps</label>
            <text syncTime="721.272" offset="2885068">I use the word ‘acquiescence' to describe what I think is the effect of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.656" offset="2898547">There were representations in the petition filed by the government requesting postponement which had the effect I submit of being an acquiescence.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.391" offset="2933551">They stated for example that the United States could make the necessary arrangements within 90 days, that they believed that it could be done in a short time, that they believe they could within that period of time reach agreement upon rates that would be satisfactory to the commission and to the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.979" offset="3031876">The United States thereby I submit Your Honors lost its right to a state and waived its right to state of the commission's actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.542" offset="3078165">On September 6th, that's the day before September 7th the effective date of the statute, the commission did postpone the cancelation of Item 20 for a period of 90 days as requested by the government, so that the cancellation was deferred until December 5, 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.623" offset="3174400">Now September 7th then arrived the following day and it's important to bear in mind that on that date, September 7th, the United States waived and lost its right to a judicial review under California law of the commission's act.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.057" offset="3272202">It's also important to Your Honors --</text>

            <text syncTime="826.219" offset="3304803">Its right to review under California law was conditioned upon its having applied to the commission for a rehearing of this decision on or before the effective date of the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.166" offset="3384633">Now, on the same date of September 7th it's important to keep in mind that for certain classes of government traffic this Section 530 of the statute as amended became effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.035" offset="3456104">Now those classes of traffic are these, all traffic in all commodities for all of the civilian agencies of the United States government, the Veterans Administration, the Bureau of Reclamation, the General Services Administration and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.318" offset="3537189">It also become effective upon certain kinds of armed forces traffic that is to say traffic in certain so called special commodities other than general commodities, petroleum, live stock, fresh fruits and vegetables for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.004" offset="3615974">Later the government requested a further postponement by 60 days of the commission's action.</text>

            <text syncTime="922.644" offset="3690475">Now as I understand I am just trying to get the sequence Mr. Phelps in my mind, the order was originally to take effect on the 7th of September and at that time the government asked to have it continued for a certain length of time.</text>

            <text syncTime="991.280" offset="3965074">What the government lost was its right to review or to seek review as of that time of the commission's cancellation as it was -- as it was done by the commission's prior order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.734" offset="4014916">But it is true the government's request for a postponement that was granted by the commission then deferred to a later date, the effective date of the cancellation and gave rise to a further opportunity for the government to seek review of that order.</text>

            <text syncTime="1027.277" offset="4109061">Yes, yes Your Honor, it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.734" offset="4134870">Now on December 2, that's the date this compliant was filed, the situation was then that the government who, I should -- I said a moment ago, had participated through out these proceedings before the commission and was represented by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.739" offset="4214909">After having participated in that proceeding and having failed to seek review of the commission's decision and requesting merely a postponement, the State of Affairs was that certain rates for certain classes of traffic established rates were in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.857" offset="4311353">And for traffic carried by the permit carriers for the armed forces, the commission's cancellation order was scheduled to become effective on December 5, three days later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.354" offset="4357329">December 2 was a Friday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.653" offset="4378540">In the afternoon of Friday, December 2, this complaint was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.991" offset="4407902">It requested a temporary restraining order and an adjudication without the statute, 530 of the code, was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.439" offset="4457744">Your Honors there was not a single word in that compliant about these prior proceedings before the commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.735" offset="4502883">The relief requested was merely that the commission be restrained from carrying into effect the terms of the Section 530.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.854" offset="4539350">Apparently however sometime before the United States attorney presented this application for a restraining order to the District Court, he or someone became aware of this decision of the commission cancelling Item 20 and apparently became aware of its significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.495" offset="4641959">And so this United States attorney urged the District Court to take action before 12:01 am the following Monday in order to prevent this action of the commission from becoming effective, that was an overall representation, there was nothing whatever in the complaint about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.046" offset="4752091">The commission was given an opportunity to appear and to be heard on this application for restraining order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.082" offset="4776229">I appeared and I pointed out to the court the difficulties involved with a restraining order that was purely prohibitory in form, and that was the form in which it had been proposed by the government, merely asking that the commission be restrained from taking action, and I pointed out to the Court that merely by the lapse of time and complete inaction by the commission, this decision of the commission would become effective at 12:01 a.m., the following Monday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.286" offset="4937143">I also pointed out that it would take affirmative action by the commission to countermand that prior decision and to accomplish what the government thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.117" offset="4968385">I advised the Court also of the difficulties involved in taking that affirmative action, maybe it was late Friday afternoon, the order was scheduled to become effective at 12:01 midnight, Monday.</text>

            <text syncTime="1870.832" offset="7483246">No but I would mention this, there has been considerable discussion as to the general government transportation policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.466" offset="7517832">And there was a concerted movement to alter or amend Section 22 of the Interstate Commerce Act in order to take away the exception with respect to Interstate Commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.475" offset="7569868">Congress last summer turned down the request.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.838" offset="7591288">Of course there would be no constitutional question there because Congress governing the transport would be able to subject its own transportation to such rates as it desires.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.569" offset="7630263">But as a matter of policy Congress determined last summer not to amend, not to repeal Section 22 but to leave the United States free of the regular tariffs for the transportation of its own, of its own property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.420" offset="7689613">That was as recently as I say this last summer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.985" offset="7703928">California on the other hand, this problem became acute in California in -- I think it was in 1954, when some small truckers began to engage in what the established trucking companies felt was cutthroat competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.649" offset="7778534">They were cutting their rates for the transportation of government property and an association of the truckers went to the Public Utility Commission in California and said, we need protection from these interlopers that are destroying our business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.673" offset="7858678">There was an attempt to remedy this through commission action and when that proved futile, the legislature of California passed the law, which repealed the exemption for government -- transportation of government property and that's the Section which is now before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.145" offset="7948539">I believe it is unnecessary by and large to go into the administrative proceedings which have occurred before the California commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.338" offset="8009352">The remedy, if it was a remedy, which the United States could have achieved through participating in those proceedings, was only a partial remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.740" offset="8050939">Section 530 of the Public Utility Code is self executing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.142" offset="8080509">It provides that -- it provides that the commission may permit common carriers to transport property at reduced rates for the United States subject to such extent and subject to such conditions as it may consider just and reasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="2598.955" offset="10395794">Now if the legislature had no power to pass the law, the law is a nullity, the commission is acting without proper authority and therefore can be enjoined, that's the -- the theory of it is that they have no real authority to act because the statute is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.457" offset="10485760">I think that the real basis that the Public Utility Commission raises this jurisdictional point is because of the actions of this Court in such cases as Public Service Commission of Utah against Wycoff and then two or three years ago a case involving the same Public Utility Commission in connection with the United Airlines cases, and in those this Court said that the particular agency hadn't attempted to bring the shipper within its jurisdiction and it was too early to try to enjoin the action, until the commission involved had decided whether or not the shipper was subject to its jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.964" offset="10683768">Now this case is different in more than one way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.777" offset="10703099">For one thing there is no question of interpretation, there's no power in the commission, not to take jurisdiction over the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.216" offset="10748761">The Act itself, there was the exception in the Act, with respect to United States and the legislature repealed the exception so that the statute is specifically now subject -- applicable to property carried for the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.177" offset="10816679">So we don't have to go back to the particular commission in order for them to determine whether or not this is applicable to this carriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.438" offset="10853669">Now that was the case in Pennsylvania and in Texas where we have these similar questions, and we have in those cases gone to the state courts in order to get that state question resolved, but here there is no such question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.322" offset="10905287">Now the second reason that this is different from the Wycoff cases and the Public Service Commission against United Airlines is that, in this case the Act is self executing and that no order of the commission is necessary in order to have these effects which we feel are so harmful to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.911" offset="11015628">The day after this act becomes effective, the United States would have to pay the tariffs set by the Public Utility Commission of California and would have to ship subject to their regulations until they got an exception.</text>

            <label>Mr. Everett C. McKeage</label>
            <text syncTime="4592.749" offset="18370978">Well I should imagine, I cannot speak except for the California Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4597.880" offset="18391458">The Supreme Court of our state pointed out that the constitution and the legislature both with liberation took from the courts of the State of California this judicial power of the state and gave it to the commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4613.621" offset="18454465">And I might say that the -- at least the reason given by the then Governor of California, Hiram W. Johnson who was responsible for this commission as it now stands, frankly stated that the reason for doing that was to place the commission above the court's of general jurisdiction because of the fact that in those days a number of these remedial statutes were being stricken down by state courts, one case the (Inaudible) case with regard to workmen's compensation, so there is no question that that was deliberately done.</text>
            <text syncTime="4654.642" offset="18618514">The commission is a constitutional agency of the State of California created by its constitutional just the same as the legislature or the executive or the judiciary is created and it was the intent that it be an independent constitutional agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="4671.263" offset="18684970">The Constitution of California by its own terms places the Public Utilities Act, which is administered by the commission, above the state constitution, if there is any conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="4684.382" offset="18737528">The cases cited in our reply brief, there is no possible question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4689.950" offset="18759784">So this Section 530 which is of the Public Utilities Code which is a private and public Utilities act is the supreme law of the State of California as far as state law is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="4707.541" offset="18830106">Now with regard to the point raised that the State of California would be, rather the federal government would be bowing to the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="4723.738" offset="18894890">I fully realize the potency of the argument made by the government with regard to that, but we know that a lot has happened since McCulloch versus Maryland and we also know that it is the duty of a court to presume, indulge ever presumption in favor of state authority in a case of this kind until the contrary is proven.</text>
            <text syncTime="4752.969" offset="19011814">In other words, the relationship between our dual form or relationship between the federal government and the state government under our dual form of government does require a little forbearance and tolerance and not resolving all these in favor of the predominant power.</text>
            <text syncTime="4773.758" offset="19094988">As was pointed out by this Court in Penn Dairies case, if the matter is decided against the state and the statute is stricken down, the state has no relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4786.991" offset="19147964">Whereas if it's decided the other way around and the Congress is of the opinion that a burden is cast upon the -- an undue burden is cast upon the federal government, it is free of course to relieve that burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="4801.006" offset="19203971">Now with regard to the matter of the present status of what of government traffic must bear these tariff rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="4813.259" offset="19252976">The only exemption that existed at the time these matters started was the exemption on general commodities with regard to the permit carriers and also a complete exemption with regard to the so called public utility carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4831.844" offset="19327373">Now the mere exemption of course of the general commodities for the armed services would not cover many of these other commodities, but you can see the way this amendment was drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="4849.389" offset="19397486">In that proviso there, it states that the public utility carriers, subject to the Public Utilities Act, may charge what permit carriers are permitting to charge to the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="4868.162" offset="19472614">Under the Highway Carriers Act, the commission has authority to exempt all government traffic from minimum rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="4878.654" offset="19514514">When it does that, automatically the Section 530 amendment comes into play and these public utility carriers are exempted from -- or rather they are given the authority to charge reduced rates to the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="4900.785" offset="19603122">So it is within the power of this commission, of the commission, if this injunction should be lifted by the exemption of government traffic under the Highway Carriers Act to automatically exempt it under the Public Utilities Act, and to institute an investigation which it would do with regard to what program to arrange in implementing Section 530, and I must contend, because the Supreme Court of our state says so, that the commission there, exercising judicial power could determine the constitutionality of Section 530, but that wholly aside whether it could exercise it that, that remains it could exercise its administrative authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="4958.053" offset="19832163">If it did hope that the government, rather these carriers must charge some proof to the government and I am not assuming that the government wants special privilege to the point of paying nothing, but suppose the commission in an investigation of that kind, which it would have instituted, had it not been for this injunction, would specify some particular procedure or rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4988.883" offset="19955461">If the United States wanted to intervene and I'm sure that it would, as it did in the Pennsylvania case, before a state commission, it could there urge all of these defenses, including unconstitutionality as it did in the Pennsylvania case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5008.787" offset="20035082">And if the commission decided against the unconstitutionality of the statute and prescribed some rates, the commission has clear authority to suspend the operating effect of its order, whereby the United States could seek review before the Supreme Court of the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="5034.732" offset="20138841">There is a procedure setup somewhat similar to what this Court pointed out in the Alabama Public Service Commission case and the matter could get to this Court in a proper way.</text>
            <text syncTime="5048.288" offset="20193071">The government would not be injured in any way whatsoever.</text>

            <text syncTime="5660.888" offset="22643461">Now there are cases I am fully aware of that dismiss a matter if the state is not joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="5670.081" offset="22680242">In other words, you can test the constitutionality of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5673.743" offset="22694870">I realize that there are cases that come up in this wise that you sue the agents of a state or of the United States and it happens to be within an area where the sovereign has not consented to be sued and the courts have held that it is law and in effect a suit against sovereign not withstanding the fact the sovereign isn't named as such but the -- its agents are named and therefore the suit fails, because consent has not been given.</text>
