            <text syncTime="493.445" offset="1973708">Then on, I think, the case I cite is Justice Sutherland, Powell versus Alabama, from that case, Justice Sullivan or Justice Sutherland says, “Even the intelligent and educated lay -- layman has small and sometimes no skill in the science of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.725" offset="2098887">If charged with a crime, he is incapable of determining for himself whether the indictment is good or bad.</text>

            <text syncTime="537.470" offset="2149878">Left without the aid of counsel, he may be put on trial without proper charges, and convicted upon incompetent evidence, irrelevant to the issue or otherwise admissible.</text>
