            <text syncTime="60.440" offset="241685">This case comes before the Court on a limited writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.304" offset="277211">That Court reversed on a divided vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.576" offset="290273">A judgment of the District Court for the District of Kansas, which after trial, dismissed three suits which have been heard together.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.667" offset="330606">The principal suit was brought by a stockholder, a single stockholder in a corporation of Illinois known as the Black-Marshall Oil Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.592" offset="374282">It was brought against the petitioner here who was the President of that corporation and the manager of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.868" offset="399464">The jurisdiction was alleged to be based on diversity of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.723" offset="418795">The complaint resounded in fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.720" offset="434782">It alleged that the plaintiff in that case had been induced to sell stock which the plaintiff owned in the Black-Marshall Oil Company as have many other stockholders, it was alleged, by reason of fraudulent representations for which the defendant was said to be responsible.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.047" offset="512104">It went on to allege that less was paid for the stock than its value at the time of the sale that the stock was held until four or five years later when there was a sale of the corporation and a winding up of its affairs at which time the stock was worth more than it had been at the time of the sale and that the defendant was a constructive trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.056" offset="600189">It alleged further that the defendant had acquired stock from the corporation without paying adequate consideration so that his share in the division of the assets of the corporation was fraudulently increased by that amount also.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.519" offset="674064">There was a second suit, which was brought by receivers which the plaintiff in the first suit had had appointed, which made the same allegations that I've just recited and asked for a recovery on behalf of the corporation for the amount of the stock, the value of the stock in liquidation which was said to have been issued without consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.367" offset="757447">There was a third case brought by other stockholders in the state court in Kansas making the same allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.000" offset="787958">Now, these cases were brought together.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.576" offset="802273">All the parties intervened in the first case and the cases were tried together before Judge Hill of the United States District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="216.494" offset="865907">The individual stockholders who brought suit asked that they be considered setting the trust of the defendant and that he should pay them the value of their stock.</text>

            <text syncTime="230.597" offset="922331">And the corporation wanted to recover from the defendant the value of the stocks supposed to have been issued without adequate compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.337" offset="957336">Judge Hill had a long file and found on the merits against the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.446" offset="977711">He found that the defendant was not guilty of any misrepresentation, that he was not responsible for the man who didn't make misrepresentations, that he was not his agent, that he did not know about it, that he'd pay full value for the stock and the -- both from the plaintiffs and also from the corporation, and the judge dismissed all the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.496" offset="1073946">There was then an appeal taken to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.294" offset="1089097">The Court of Appeals, over the dissent of one of the judges, reversed the District Court on the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.218" offset="1112816">It found the defendant, the petitioner in that Court of -- of the respondent in that Court guilty of fraud and allowed the individuals to recover on the shares which they had sold under these representations, either to the defendant below or to the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.232" offset="1196826">The Court then went on and allowed the receivers to recover the value of the stock which this Court of Appeals said had been issued without consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.834" offset="1235278">So there were two recoveries, the individual plaintiffs on the shares which they had sold and the receivers on account of the stock issued without consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.155" offset="1276552">As the federal jurisdiction, the Court of Appeals said that the question was whether the claims of the stockholders who did not have diversity of citizenship in the state court and those who intervened in the federal court could be heard because there were common questions of law and fact, and common reliefs sought under Federal Rule 23 (a) (3).</text>
            <text syncTime="343.268" offset="1372996">In other words, was it what is commonly known as the spurious class action, an action which has in common questions of law and fact, but no jural connection between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.399" offset="1425554">And the Court held that it was such a case and that in the -- that such cases, only the original plaintiff needed to establish diversity of citizenship and that then, others could come in regardless of their own citizenship.</text>

            <text syncTime="538.162" offset="2152594">They do.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.786" offset="2163043">After the Court made the decision to which I referred, a petition for rehearing is filed and as result of that petition for rehearing, the Court of Appeals withdrew its judgment and its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.251" offset="2216960">Because it appeared to the Court of Appeals that when it -- it ought -- have allowed the receivers to recover on behalf of the corporation, the result of their action there was that the purchaser of the corporation stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.670" offset="2266593">It was not involved in this suit at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.388" offset="2273489">It was an outside corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.577" offset="2282266">And then on, all the stock of the corporation would as a result of the receiver's success merely recover a large part of his purchase price back again.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.377" offset="2317479">And since that was not an equitable result, it withdrew the judgment and decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.136" offset="2340467">And then it held that each plaintiff and each intervener who had established that he had fraudulent representations made to him, was permitted to recover both for the wrong against himself and for the wrong against the corporation, which the Court went on to say, was not really a wrong against the corporation but had now been transformed into a wrong against the interveners and the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.667" offset="2442658">So these were merged together and each plaintiff and intervener was allowed to recover on his own right.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.069" offset="2476199">In regard to jurisdiction, the Court affirmed its earlier finding that the jurisdiction allay in Rule 23 (a) (3) that these suits were joined together by common questions of fact in law and common relief was asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.392" offset="2557492">We asked the certiorari to this Court on both questions, both on the fact that the Court had been wrong in reversing the District Court on facts and also that the Court had been wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.963" offset="2615798">I'm saying that under Rule 23 (a) (3) where there were common questions only of law and fact that each intervener or plaintiff did not have to establish federal jurisdiction independently.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.597" offset="2666371">This Court granted certiorari on the jurisdictional question only and our brief present as a -- presents it here as it was presented to Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.698" offset="2710779">The question presented is whether a number of persons asserting separate and distinct demands as -- as to which there were some common questions of law and fact may intervene in the proceeding in a federal court regardless of the citizenship of each intervener or of the jurisdictional requirements as the Court of Appeals held they might do, merely because the original plaintiff in this so-called spurious class action possessed the requisite jurisdictional requirements including diversity of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.304" offset="2837211">That was what we thought was the question presented and that was the question on which this Court allowed certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.469" offset="2869812">But in his brief on the merits filed on the 11th of October before this Court, my learned and distinguished brother, counsel for the respondents says that that is not the question presented at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.876" offset="2919445">It's quite a different question.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.897" offset="2927491">And he says that the Court was led to believe that that was the question presented on account of representations by me.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.568" offset="2962181">Now, of course nothing could show me with more regret than to have led this Court into error, which would be wasteful of its time.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.055" offset="2996140">But I have a feeling that perhaps my responsibility is reduced here and the likelihood that error has occurred is practically minimized by the fact that my distinguished brother took exactly this attitude quite successfully in both the lower courts in this very case.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.163" offset="3064581">It was he who argued that this case fell on this Rule 23 (a) (3), both in the District Court and in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.757" offset="3102929">It was he who argued that under Rule 23 (a) (3), it was necessary only to establish diversity of citizenship and the original plaintiff and that all others could come flooding in under that protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.708" offset="3162802">We unfortunately, were quite unsuccessful in both the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.739" offset="3182864">First of all, it was argued that this wasn't a class suit of any sort, spurious or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.107" offset="3204389">But if we were wrong about that and if my brother was right, nevertheless, even under Section 23 (a) (3), each plaintiff or intervener must establish his own right to be in a federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.641" offset="3262485">However, we were swept away by the success of our opponent's advocacy and the Court held with him that this was an (a) -- 23 (a) (3) case, that it was bound, all these cases were bound together by common questions of law and fact and a common recovery and in such a case, it was not necessary to establish more than the original plaintiff's diversity of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.702" offset="3374707">Counsel who was self-triumphant in presenting that point of view to the court below now charge us with -- perhaps indicating something which was not altogether accurate in saying that that is the question involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.824" offset="3435207">And I think the Court will understand that perhaps we experience some of the emotions of the lamb in Aesop's fable which was abraded by the wolf for polluting the stream from which the wolf was drinking, although the unfortunate lamb was a long way downstream from the wolf.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.779" offset="3507096">But however that may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.298" offset="3517127">We have collected all the arguments of counsel for the respondents in our brief, ten pages of these arguments in the reply brief on pages 10 to 14 -- 4 to 14, to indicate that their view at that time was quite identical with the view which we hold now as to the question which is presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.763" offset="3610958">We leave this phase of the argument without dwelling on -- on those formal expressions of our opponents with perhaps only two comments.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.074" offset="3660278">One is to paraphrase a remark which I heard made from this bench a great many years ago by Mr. Justice Holmes, who -- who said that when counsel come to reconcile his present exegesis with his past position, he may count on my undivided attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.160" offset="3736555">The other observation is that however unlikely it may be that counsel on both sides in this case and both lower courts have been wholly wrong about the basis of federal jurisdiction, it is still conceivable and it still falls within the power of the human mind to grasp that that might be so, and therefore, it's necessary to turn to a consideration of what our opponents believed as the question presented and that brings me to the question asked by Mr. Justice Harlan.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.530" offset="3866018">Whereas they thought in the District Court and in the Court of Appeals that this was a common law and common fact question and fell under Rule 23 (a) (3), they have now discovered that it isn't that sort of a case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.262" offset="3924950">It's a case involving, they believe, interdependent claims to a common fund and therefore, falls not under 23 (a) (3) but under 23 (a) (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="996.607" offset="3986390">But they believe it is a -- a case exactly like a creditor's bill case, you know, where there has been a fraudulent transaction, receivers are appointed upon this, brought into Court, all creditors come in and the fund is divided among those who -- who come into Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.308" offset="4053159">And they are of course -- it is a long and well-established rule that if the plaintiff has diversity of citizenship, then the distribution of the fund to others who may have an interest in it, that is merely ancillary to the original proceeding, and therefore, they may come in, because clearly, if they did not come in, their rights would be cut off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.983" offset="4135915">The fund is going to be distributed and their rights would be -- would -- would be gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.671" offset="4158589">But in the present case, there's no common fund at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.893" offset="4171546">Instead, here are a group of separate plaintiffs and interveners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.769" offset="4187011">They're all plaintiffs who have claims based upon fraudulent representations alleged to have been made to each one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.638" offset="4226508">It is alleged that each one of them relied on his fraudulent reputation -- representations, that each one took action and each one suffered a loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.871" offset="4263393">And as a result of all of that, it is said that the defendant became a constructive trustee and that he holds their stock and the proceeds of their stock for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.405" offset="4305607">They're clearly -- there are separate recovery sought against a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.044" offset="4332147">They have no jural connection whatever with one another and they are both together for trial merely because there are common questions of fact and common questions of law and common money judgments asked, not to have a participation in a fund, but have to -- to have individual judgments against the petitioner, Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.941" offset="4415739">Now, there would be no argument about this at all if the facts were simply that the defendant acquired the stock from the individual plaintiffs, kept it until the dissolution of the company and then received so much for each purchase of stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.180" offset="4484702">Clearly then, each purchaser will be seen to be coming to the defendant and asking for the value of his stock which had been purchased as a result of the fraudulent representations before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.873" offset="4531409">But here, there are two facts, which while they do not change the -- the conclusion that there is no common fund, whatever, do make the computation only a slightly bit -- slight bit more complicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.618" offset="4582400">These facts are -- are the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.057" offset="4592222">I mentioned a little while ago that a -- the defendant was accused of having taken stock for the corporation for which he paid no adequate consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.225" offset="4636839">The lower court held that he did pay adequate consideration but the Circuit Court of Appeal, the Court of Appeals said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.217" offset="4660767">Now as to that stock, the Court of Appeals says, "Since no adequate consideration was paid for it, we regard it as cancelled, just strike it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.587" offset="4698279">In determining what the value per share was on dissolution, pay no attention to that stuff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.201" offset="4720744">Furthermore, the Court of Appeals says that not all of the stock purchased from all the plaintiffs and intervene -- intervenors was held by the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.817" offset="4759197">Some of it in his capacity as President of the company, he had retired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.425" offset="4777691">So the Court says, "Strike out the stock which he got without payment of adequate consideration and add on the shares which were retired."</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.981" offset="4815830">Now, that the biggest shares which he got allegedly without compensation numbered 32 odd thousand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.012" offset="4844042">The number of shares which were retired, numbered 31 odd thousand shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.585" offset="4866299">So the simple result is that you detract from the stock about 1000 shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.393" offset="4897541">You take away 32, you add 31, the difference is one and therefore, instead of having 86,000 shares outstanding, there were 85 something, and each stockholder's value of his stock is computed on -- on the basis of the smaller outstanding shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.084" offset="4964310">It -- it makes no difference in -- in the -- in the ultimate value of the stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.370" offset="4981447">On dissolution, the value per share was according to respondent's figures, $51.06.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.184" offset="5008718">As a result of all these computation, it turns out to be $51.75, a trivial and unimportant modification of -- of that share value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.719" offset="5054798">Still, each claimant is claiming a money judgment against the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.393" offset="5073502">Each claimant is claiming the value of his stock, the only thing that has changed is that the per share value instead of $51.06 is now $51.75.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.997" offset="5107984">It still leaves it individual claims against an individual defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.978" offset="5131912">Now, our opponents have a difficult time in suggesting that this creates a common fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.133" offset="5164513">So they're going to change the argument and say the claims are interdependent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.972" offset="5179873">Well now, why are they interdependent?</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.544" offset="5186142">What -- what is interdependent about?</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.339" offset="5197322">They say because each respondent who is -- each plaintiff who is victorious affects the case in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.011" offset="5239954">One way in which he affects it is that he is entitled to recover.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.891" offset="5255523">Another way in which he affects it is that his shares, if they have been retired, have to be added back in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.136" offset="5280496">Therefore, the more shares that are added back in, the greater the total outstanding shares and when you divide it, the -- the denominator of the fraction is reduced or changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.656" offset="5326576">This is a pure calculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.954" offset="5339742">It has nothing to do with a common fund and it -- it really isn't true even in fact that each -- that recovery of each claimant affects the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.954" offset="5391778">Now, why is that so?</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.382" offset="5397525">Because as I've suggested a moment ago, some of the shares which were purchased were not retired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.942" offset="5423752">Therefore, to the extent of all those who are not retired, clearly, you don't add their shares to the outstanding stock because they were outstanding still.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.442" offset="5461682">There is no -- that affects the computation in no way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.770" offset="5479027">The important thing is that all of these has to do with computing the value of some shares for which defendant as held by the Circuit Court, the Court of Appeals to be a constructive trustee, it has nothing to do with a common fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.992" offset="5539944">There is no fund of money which is to be divided among all these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.496" offset="5557917">Each one has a separate claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.750" offset="5570978">Each one has to make out his own right to recover by showing that representations were made to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.492" offset="5601907">Each one has to make out that he -- he relied upon these representations enacted to his objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.709" offset="5642762">Now, if this is so, then clearly, this is a -- a case of common questions of law and fact, the questions -- a case under 23 (a) (3).</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.263" offset="5689051">If that is the case, then we assert that each claimant has to make out his own right to come into a federal court and that conclusion is hardly disputed in the brief on the merits by our opponents.</text>

            <text syncTime="1546.152" offset="6184542">People ran off for the whole effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.674" offset="6194678">Now, $176,000 was traced to two men.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.520" offset="6214008">The -- they had -- they were found in possession of that much of the -- of the swag.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.107" offset="6244415">Two of the subscribers who had diversity of citizenship as against A and B who went off with the money, brought them into the federal court and there, it was proved and judgment was given that they had improperly taken these funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.429" offset="6305646">At this point, by service by publication, by registered mail, all possible ways, all the available living reachable, original subscribers were brought into Court and there, they were given their proportionate share of the $176,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.047" offset="6380147">Of course they weren't quite all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.582" offset="6386312">Of the people, some had died or moved away, but vastly more than -- than $176,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.934" offset="6411703">So their proportion was whatever they subscribed, the fraction over $600,000 divided into the 176.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.895" offset="6443572">Now the Court says, "The presence of all these other people is ancillary to our distribution of this fund of $176,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.393" offset="6489548">We have it properly before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.855" offset="6495399">We have to distribute it, and therefore, we must have, regardless of -- of citizenship of the people who claim an interest in that fund."</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.197" offset="6528731">This is exactly the kind of a case that the one before this Court is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.029" offset="6548062">And it's pointed out in the very next case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.892" offset="6559556">It's -- the one I have just mentioned is a case exactly like Stewart versus Dunham which Your Honors decided, and is a case of a creditor's bill, but you said the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.100" offset="6604382">Now, in the next case, this shows where the line is drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.129" offset="6628415">It's a case of Ayer versus Kemper in the 48 F.2d.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.398" offset="6645551">Here we had Judges Learned Hand, Swan and Chase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.898" offset="6659553">Judge Chase holds over from the earlier case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.472" offset="6673868">Here, Kemper was the receiver of a railway and a fiduciary for Ayer and the other note holders who -- whose security he held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.569" offset="6714201">By fraudulent representations, the trustee purchased from the note holders their notes, both by positive representations and by the suppression of information, which it's -- was his duty to disclose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.886" offset="6771461">Question then arose whether persons not before the Court were bound by the judgment of the Court in that case, and Judges Hand, Swan and Chase said, "Most certainly not."</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.275" offset="6821094">Each one of these men has a separate -- totally a separate action against Kemper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.731" offset="6842828">He -- he misled each one separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.285" offset="6853068">Each one relied separately on the misrepresentation and each one is bound.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.911" offset="6875638">Those who are not before the Court are not bound and each one must establish his own federal right to come into a federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.428" offset="6909701">There was no common fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.144" offset="6916493">They were separate suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.331" offset="6929241">Then come in to one other case in this in the Second Circuit, 164 Federal, Steele versus the Guaranty Trust Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.084" offset="6964245">There, the judges were Learned Hand, Augustus Hand and Jerome Frank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.205" offset="6984725">In that case, the Guaranty Trust Company was a trustee of note issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.952" offset="7003742">By breach of its fiduciary duties, it failed to take action against the debtor until so much of his assets were dissipated that only 49% on -- on each note's value could be recovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.285" offset="7069048">He didn't even act then.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.427" offset="7077616">So each one of these note holders joined in together in a suit, brings action against the Guaranty Trust Company saying, "Your breach of duty lost me at least 49% of my investment."</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.888" offset="7135504">And the Court said, "These are separate suits."</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.342" offset="7149296">Judge Frank's language, "Is a 'conjuries' of separate suits under Rule 23 (a) (3) where each claimant must prove federal jurisdiction."</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.644" offset="7194540">Then I had another case very much like it, Miller versus the National City Bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.509" offset="7213976">In that case, we have Judge Learned Hand, Judge Swan and Judge Frank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.099" offset="7232366">This was a case in which the National City Bank was alleged to have entered into a conspiracy with the Guaranty to induce note holders under towards -- where that Guaranty was a trustee of security for the notes, not to take action against the Guaranty until the fund had been used by the Guaranty for purposes of its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.768" offset="7323063">In this case, these judges again said, "These are separate claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.914" offset="7343647">What you say in effect is that the National City Bank deceived each one of you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.207" offset="7368725">Each one of you was induced not to proceed against the Guaranty until the funds were gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.081" offset="7392235">There is no jural connection between you, there is no fund in the hands of the National City.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.941" offset="7411670">You are suing it for breach of trust and -- and tort claim."</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.252" offset="7432986">Another case of the same court is (Inaudible) Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.051" offset="7456183">Here we had Judge Learned Hand and Judge Chase and Judge Frank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.761" offset="7474991">That case was held that stockholders who bring a suit for injunction against the corporation to prevent the sale of stock and alleged violation of their preemptive rights have separate suits against the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.063" offset="7532251">The suits are -- are brought together by reason of common questions of law and fact under Rule 23 (a) (3) and each must prove his own right to come into the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.437" offset="7585646">Now, Your Honors, this has been a long excursion in pursuit of -- of respondent's statement as what is the question presented to you?</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.025" offset="7632039">But I think it has not been wholly wasted because I think it does show us that the present case is truly a case of separate claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.795" offset="7667148">There is no common fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.610" offset="7674358">There's no jural connection between these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.430" offset="7685642">Each one says he was deceived or she was deceived.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.212" offset="7700793">Each one says he or she relied on these representations and indeed in the court below, it was found that some did and some didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.537" offset="7734126">And therefore, those who did not rely or were not deceived were not allowed to recover and those who were in the opinion of the Court were allowed to recover.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.645" offset="7774563">And I think it shows also to us the reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.141" offset="7788460">This is not merely an arbitrary -- arbitrary matter of saying, "Well, if you're under Section 23 (a) (2), you don't have to show federal jurisdiction, but if you put -- make the number 3 than you do, that isn't the point."</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.097" offset="7840287">The point is that where there are separate suits, those who are not before the Court are not bound by the result, whereas, if there are separate suits, where -- where there are separate suits, they are not bound by the result and therefore, they must prove their right to come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.063" offset="7912176">Each one has his own lawsuit and he must prove his right to come in to a federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.568" offset="7934224">Whereas, if there is a fund and the Court has jurisdiction over the fund, because the original plaintiff had diversity, then the claims of these intervenors in such a case are purely ancillary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.852" offset="7987304">The Court is going to dispose of the fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.191" offset="7996709">The fund is there in Court to be divided and everyone claiming an interest must in right be able to come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.438" offset="8025652">The first case, I've mentioned a moment ago that Judge Frank said, "These are merely a 'conjuries' of -- of separate cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.983" offset="8059925">Judge Prettyman in the Court of Appeals here in the district says that the joinder of cases such as the one involved here is a matter of economy and efficiency on the part of courts and parties, an avoidance of multiplicity of suits."</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.723" offset="8122828">And he goes on to point out that each claimant or intervenor must prove his own right to be in a federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.202" offset="8156787">Even Professor Moore upon whose writings the court below relied and they were recited -- cited by the respondents, the court below followed them.</text>

            <text syncTime="2077.989" offset="8311954">Originally, in support of that view, we gave Your Honor's decision in the Stewart case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2142.609" offset="8570358">He says that if there are only a few such plaintiffs or interveners, then they must act under Rule 24 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.498" offset="8597943">They must ask to intervene.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.565" offset="8606198">And when they ask to intervene, they must show federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.131" offset="8620513">But if there are a whole lot of then, then they join together under Rule 23 (a) (3) and come in as a spurious class and then they don't have to show it at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.277" offset="8661055">And he says the reason for this is procedural convenience.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.723" offset="8678818">In other words, there are only two or three, you have to show -- each one shows his federal jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2225.773" offset="8903053">Well, Your Honor, our argument leads to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.796" offset="8923115">We say that only in those cases where there was diversity did the Court have jurisdiction to any -- under any kind of a decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.031" offset="8960104">Now, we will come -- I'll come right to it now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.665" offset="8974629">Our opponents say to us, -- well, this is just a dry legal question because they only admit that there are two people who -- who are citizens of California, which is the State of which the defendant is a citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.906" offset="9039621">I say it's clear about these two.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.568" offset="9050175">Well, the fact of the matter is that it's very unclear about the rest of them because there are no allegations as to their citizenship except the original plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.791" offset="9087164">There is very sketchy proof, no request for findings of fact and no findings of (Inaudible).</text>

            <text syncTime="2282.673" offset="9130632">So far as these two are concerned, their phrase is, "We would have won a skirmish, but lost the war," if Your Honors decide as we urge you to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.103" offset="9172323">We think we can worry about what we have won or lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.122" offset="9188415">In fact, these two people have claims which on one basis, the respondent's calculation are said to be $100,000, on another basis, $200,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.180" offset="9232718">So it's an -- substantial in and of itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.939" offset="9243690">But the -- the thing that is really important here is if this jurisdictional question is straightened out, and the cases go back to the -- reconsidered on the basis of proper jurisdiction, then there arises a question which really may go to the very heart of this recovery and that is whether the Black-Marshall Oil Company is a necessary party defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.609" offset="9354344">If it is, it is a citizen of Illinois and certainly a large number of these plaintiffs who claim to have lived in Illinois at the time these actions took place are citizens of the same State as a necessary defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.249" offset="9416934">Now, whether it's a necessary defendant or not, we are not asking this Court to decide, although we are scolded by our opponents for discussing some matters beyond the strict jurisdictional question.</text>

            <text syncTime="2794.149" offset="11176542">Now, may I just take one further moment and save the rest of my time because our opponents have introduced into their brief filed in October what seems to me to be a new thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.879" offset="11235474">And that is that there on pages 48 and 51 of their brief, they say that -- there's a federal question here, this is -- case really don't have to rest on diversity at all, that their cause of action was stated and proved under a rule of the Securities and Exchange Commission which was authorized by the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.517" offset="11334008">Now, although this case was filed, these petitions were filed at 1949, no evidence, no argument, oral or written, has ever been based on this claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.271" offset="11381029">It is not imperative before until this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.946" offset="11399732">In the District Court, no findings of fact or conclusions of law were asked for on the basis of any federal question being involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.904" offset="11435572">In the Court of Appeals, there was no argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.739" offset="11446857">In the brief and opposition in this Court, it was not mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.686" offset="11462740">Even in the brief on the merits, the respondents do not suggest that this claim which they now advance for the first time is one of the questions presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.892" offset="11511536">There has been no mention of this so-called rule, which is a rule indeed of the SEC until this brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.347" offset="11541316">There was not even a mention of the Act of 1934 in any pleading which is shown in the record as certified by the District Court to the Court of Appeals or by the Court of Appeals to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.567" offset="11602233">So tenuous is this claim that counsel for the respondents did not even notice until October 1957 that an amendment to a pleading which they have made earlier had been left out of the record ever since 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.402" offset="11673600">They amended the pleadings by striking out a reference to one federal statute and putting in a reference to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.696" offset="11714769">That was in 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.100" offset="11736398">In printing the record from the District Court to the Court of Appeals, this reference was left out, they didn't even notice it, the three and a half years, so little attention that they pay to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.973" offset="11779866">What actually happened is -- on paragraph 19 on page 8 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.576" offset="11818214">In their original complaint, they have an information, believe the conspirators -- conspiracies, joint ventures and unlawful acts violated the Federal Securities Act of 1933, the Farm Credit Act and various other acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.073" offset="11876206">And an -- an amendment, they struck out the Farm Credit Act and put in the Securities and Exchange Act of 1932, 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.283" offset="11905045">This was left out in printing the record, they didn't even notice it for three and a half years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.689" offset="11926674">And in regard to such an argument, I suggest only what this Court has said in the Niles- Bement Farm Company case that it was an afterthought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.393" offset="11973486">Much too casual in media to give serious color to the claim now made, but the cause of action asserted is one arising under the laws of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="3016.220" offset="12064810">My distinguished brother has made some reference to an earlier participation of mine in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.167" offset="12100650">I think he somewhat overemphasizes the significance of -- add harmony on -- in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.714" offset="12130847">He does it very pleasantly but I think it reflects somewhat of an overappraisal of the importance of that matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.657" offset="12162612">We -- we'll refer to that a little later on if our time permits, and I think it will.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.166" offset="12204617">I want to digress from the ordered plan of my argument to say this at the very outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.467" offset="12241816">If my distinguished opponent has said once, he said 20 times that here, you have no fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.338" offset="12273267">I don't want to catapult myself into a discussion of this case on the merits before I've led up to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.979" offset="12299912">But I just want to say this about that contention that here there's no fund, which is the critical thing apparently in petitioner's mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.260" offset="12344947">In every single case in which this Court has exercised ancillary jurisdiction over non-diverse interveners in order to finally permit a court to dispose a property or money or a fund of which it's taken control.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.540" offset="12410149">There isn't a single one of those cases in which there's any money locked up in the clerk's drawer or in the registry of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.336" offset="12441287">Every single case is a case in which a court has taken jurisdiction of some fund by virtue of having service upon the defendant and has impressed an equitable trust upon that money and that's precisely what the Court did here with reference to Black's unjust enrichment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.658" offset="12530625">I -- I want to go on and develop this case if I may in an orderly way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.297" offset="12549120">The Court was persuaded to grant certiorari here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.172" offset="12560614">We say it with great deference and humility to decide a question which is not presented by the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.643" offset="12594469">Certiorari was granted upon the representation of the petitioners here that respondent's claims are related solely in the sense that they involve some common questions of law and fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.369" offset="12653401">The question stated by you for decision simply assumed the correctness of that assumption, copied it out of their petition and set that down as the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.870" offset="12691435">That question is not here before this Court on the facts of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.051" offset="12712124">The claims of the numerous parties here are not separate and distinct, they're interdependent claims to property upon which the Court of Appeals impressed a constructive trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.290" offset="12761130">The claim of each party here is for a proportionate share of the distribution of the 1947 sale which came into Black's hands as unjust enrichment and upon which the Court impressed a constructive trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.945" offset="12823719">The claims are interdependent by their very nature inherently and my friend on the other side is compelled in light of the decisions of this Court to conceive that if they are interdependent, then the Court has ancillary jurisdiction to deal with non-diverse interveners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.155" offset="12892578">Now, I'm going to show in the reply brief when they finally face the facts that they have admitted the interdependence of these claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.843" offset="12923298">Now, a second question before the Court and I shall undertake later to show that this is a substantial question, is whether or not quite apart from the diversity of citizenship or any question about that, this Court has jurisdiction because of the existence here of a federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.228" offset="12996859">The complaint alleged, they say it -- it's an afterthought.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.652" offset="13010547">The complaint alleged that Black's fraud here constituted not only a violation of the common law but that it constituted a violation of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and thus, made unlawful and forbad the gross fraud committed by William Black in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.845" offset="13111380">Now, if you please, to know whether these claims are related solely in the sense that they involve some common questions or whether their interdependent claims and to know whether this federal cause of action is a substantial cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.538" offset="13178149">It's necessary to look at the facts, look at the facts as to how the case arose, how Black treated these shares, what relief is sought and the formula of the Court of Appeals for determining how much everybody is entitled to it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3558.500" offset="14233913">The first agreement that they made between them to show that fiduciary relationship is that in this agreement, Black was authorized to transact all business of every kind and nature under and in connection with said agreement without interference from any parties of the second part.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.201" offset="14300787">Well, he didn't find oil in Illinois and so he moved to Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.070" offset="14316251">And again, this group of Aledo people advanced in excess of all he used in the purchase and leasing and development of our properties in the state of Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.633" offset="14366511">A corporation was formed and they were allotted shares in proportion to their advances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.248" offset="14388976">That was a corporation just informed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.880" offset="14399425">The Circuit Court of Appeals states for all practical purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.345" offset="14413322">Now, I'm quoting, “Black was the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.307" offset="14425130">He did with it as he saw fit and the stockholders followed him with almost blind loyalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.859" offset="14451357">In Kansas, Black struck oil fairly prolifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.365" offset="14469433">In 1944 when the properties began to increase in value, he formulated what the Court of Appeals called a -- and I'm quoting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.816" offset="14511229">"A definite plan to eliminate the large family of stockholders including the Aledo group and to acquire the stock or a majority of it in the effectuation of that plan.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.553" offset="14558145">Our respondent's faith and confidence in Black was such that he didn't need to indulge in any particular subtleties in order to get this stock away from them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3648.323" offset="14593254">He just told them or had them told that the company had been sold, if you please, and that their share amounted to about $11 per share.H</text>
            <text syncTime="3661.903" offset="14647589">He told them they must just turn in their stock a half of it in 1944 and the other half in 1945 and they did so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.043" offset="14684160">Now, the shares that were thus personally acquired were paid for by Back out of company funds that he just made in advance to himself for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3680.569" offset="14722194">He took a block of it in his own name, just put in his own name.</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.178" offset="14736614">At the bulk of it, he just simply retired.</text>
            <text syncTime="3686.650" offset="14746540">Well, since at the time of liquidation he owned practically all the stock, put in it -- retire and it had just the same effects substantially as that that he took in his own name as if he'd taken it all in his own name.</text>
            <text syncTime="3699.927" offset="14799621">Now, Black's second major fraud was the secret issuance to himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.754" offset="14814981">He was the corporation as the Court of Appeal said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3706.918" offset="14827624">He just issued to himself 32,000 shares as a secret property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3711.970" offset="14847791">The Court of Appeals says about that, “It's clear beyond doubt that it was issued surreptitiously, covertly, and we say fraudulently to Black."</text>
            <text syncTime="3723.928" offset="14895647">I -- actually, the company hadn't been sold at all in 1944 but in 1947 when he had succeeded in his plan of eliminating what was pleasantly called the family of stockholders, where then he sold to NCRA for a price of $4.5 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="3742.138" offset="14968477">Now we've designated for printing Black's entire record or testimony on cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3748.780" offset="14995017">I committed to your attention because it shows the particular way in which it -- he handled these shares that make these claims interdependent, claims to this fund upon which the Court impressed a constructive trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="3761.196" offset="15044754">It also shows that we've got a violation of the federal statute here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3766.109" offset="15064398">Incidentally, it shows through Black's own list, a fraud as callous and cruel as was ever committed by a fiduciary against people who trusted him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3780.896" offset="15123540">Now, at the time of the sale of this stock, this company, Black owned the predominant majority of the stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="3795.555" offset="15182158">His stock consisted of three increments, the 32,000 shares that he stole.</text>
            <text syncTime="3802.550" offset="15210162">It consisted of the shares that he got from these respondents that he just put in his own name.</text>
            <text syncTime="3810.821" offset="15243180">It consisted of a block of shares that he legally owned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3815.192" offset="15260735">Now, all of those shares are the participation of all of those shares was of course very greatly increased in the participation of the -- in the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3829.108" offset="15316428">Their share was very greatly increased by the fraudulent acquisition and the arbiter retirement of these thousands of shares of the respondents nationally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3839.519" offset="15358015">The result was that Black took about $3.5 million out of the $4.5 million purchase price.</text>
            <text syncTime="3848.314" offset="15393228">Now, on those facts, I want to deal first with the federal question because it isn't necessary to say much about it and I can get that out of the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3858.572" offset="15434188">We say, if you please, that without regard whatsoever to the existence of diversity jurisdiction, there's a federal question here that gives the federal court jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3872.599" offset="15490299">In that, the complaint alleged a federal statutory cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3878.502" offset="15513913">Section 10 (b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 in conjunction with Rule X-10B-5 of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which that Act requires to be made, make unlawful acts which constitute fraud or deceit in the purchase of securities and thus, make unlawful, the gross fraud committed by Black in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3909.131" offset="15636480">Specifically, it's made unlawful by the Act and the rule by means of the instrumentalities of interstate commerce which were used here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3918.250" offset="15672947">I quote, “to engage in any act, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3935.075" offset="15740238">Now, I say to you that within the rule cited or quoted or laid down, I should say by this Court in Hurn versus Oursler.</text>
            <text syncTime="3946.044" offset="15784124">What we have here is a single cause of action for fraud supported on two grounds, a common law ground and a federal ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="3957.115" offset="15828428">We charge fraud and we prove fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="3961.548" offset="15846191">Here, far from this question, they -- they attempt to -- I think if they say it's a happenstance or an afterthought, it'll go away.</text>
            <text syncTime="3971.836" offset="15887256">But here, far from the federal question being insubstantial, the Court of Appeals decision may fairly be read to sustain the cause of action on the federal ground as well as on the state ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="3987.548" offset="15950158">It's a determination of fraud committed by Black and that satisfies both the state and the federal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3996.487" offset="15985894">Of course such a construction of the opinion isn't at all necessary under the rule of this Court to sustain the existence of a federal question and to sustain the existence of the federal court's jurisdiction for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="4014.431" offset="16057678">The rule of the Court stated in the Syler case is that if the federal question is substantial, the federal court has jurisdiction even if the Court omits to pass upon the federal question or even if it rules adversely upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4034.583" offset="16138240">And I suggest to the Court that while the merits of this federal claim are of course not before this Court, we think that if -- far from being insubstantial, whether that question were here, this Court would certainly hold that Black's gross fraud is not beyond the reach of the Securities and Exchange Act and Rule X-10B-5.</text>
            <text syncTime="4061.281" offset="16245029">And so, we respectfully submit that the position that the federal court had jurisdiction here because of the existence of a federal cause of action is invulnerable and we think it's more invulnerable or we think that there's great evidence of its invulnerability from the manner in which they attempt to deal with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4087.191" offset="16348682">They say in their brief, and my distinguished friend has said here, citing Niles versus Beeman (ph), the contention is an afterthought.</text>
            <text syncTime="4098.930" offset="16395703">That's a fragment of this sentence in which that language appears.</text>
            <text syncTime="4104.749" offset="16418900">The sentence is this; “The contention is an afterthought and plainly was not in the mind of the writer of the bill of complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="4115.223" offset="16460800">That's what this Court hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="4117.529" offset="16470100">Here in paragraphs 8F, and I want to be explicit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4122.124" offset="16488490">In paragraphs 8F and 19 of the complaint, we explicitly alleged a violation of the statute and quoted almost the entire text of Rule X-10B-5.</text>
            <text syncTime="4140.527" offset="16562051">The evidence, if you please, proved equally.</text>
            <text syncTime="4144.317" offset="16577202">We weren't talking -- of course neither side was talking about what kind of fraud this is, we were talking about whether we're -- whether there was fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="4152.115" offset="16608444">But the decision of the Court of Appeals establishes equally a violation of the federal claim and a violation of the state claim and it would require --</text>

            <text syncTime="4301.284" offset="17205081">Although they presently have a great deal to say in favor of a state determination to this question naturally, they wanted a federal determination until they got it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4312.564" offset="17250220">And secondly, as to diversity, there's no genuine question here as to the diversity of citizenship with these parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="4322.231" offset="17288882">When a party testifies, I submit that he's been farming in the State of Illinois for 40 years or living in Aledo for 27 years and that was the type of testimony offered here.</text>

            <text syncTime="4741.609" offset="18966361">I'm going to show that they've had to concede in the reply briefs that that just isn't so.</text>
            <text syncTime="4747.166" offset="18988617">That's the issue between us.</text>
            <text syncTime="4749.096" offset="18996349">Now, the theory of these class actions which the Court of Appeals sustained is this, that these people that were defrauded of their stock continued to be the equitable owners of that stock until the time of the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="4763.724" offset="19054864">And that upon the sale, equity impressed a constructive trust upon that portion of the purchased price that came into Black's hands for the interest represented by those shares equitably held by these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="4779.639" offset="19118498">And he denominated Black a trustee ex maleficio to account for that unjust enrichment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4787.059" offset="19148173">The Court recognized first that the rights being vindicated was a common right to participate in that unjust enrichment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4794.179" offset="19176699">The Court said this, three -- two or three sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="4798.348" offset="19193313">“In equity, the stockholders remain the owners of their shares with the right to participate in the proceeds of the sale in the proportion that their stock ownership there as to the total stock entitled to participate in the assets of the company at the time of sale.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4815.314" offset="19261231">I'm still quoting.</text>
            <text syncTime="4816.428" offset="19265620">“In these circumstances, equity will impress a trust upon the stock and constitute Black a trustee for the profits he reaped from the date he received it until he finally sold it or retired.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4830.160" offset="19320581">Now, here's the reason these claims are interdependent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4833.721" offset="19334792">The fact is that no one having a claim here that his shares were fraudulently acquired and arbitrarily retired.</text>
            <text syncTime="4842.822" offset="19371259">No such person has a claim for any fixed absolute or pre-determinable amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="4849.444" offset="19397695">All he has is a claim that he was deprived of a common right to participate in the proceeds of the 1947 sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="4859.087" offset="19436251">The claim and the recovery on each of these claims of the defrauded stockholders necessarily depended therefore on the total number of shares that were fraudulently acquired, and entitled to be equitably outstanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4873.798" offset="19495184">And that obviously depended in turn upon the determination of the total number of shares that were entitled to participate on the ground that their -- of the owners that their shares were fraudulently acquired and arbitrarily retired.</text>
            <text syncTime="4890.508" offset="19561953">And so, the claims are inherently interdependent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4894.191" offset="19576686">Now, I want to sharply contrast the explicit representation -- I don't mean to use that in an unpleasant sense, the -- the assertion of my friend on the other side on which this Court granted certiorari, I want to contrast that with fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4914.984" offset="19659860">Petitioner told this Court, “Your plaintiffs are to be paid in full.</text>
            <text syncTime="4923.047" offset="19692147">Your recovery is based on an ordinary tort liability for defrauding.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4929.105" offset="19716389">I want to contrast that with the court of -- what the Court of Appeals said.</text>
            <text syncTime="4933.368" offset="19733420">“Recovery is predicated upon the equitable principle of unjust enrichment, not the theory of provable damages.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4940.297" offset="19761110">Well then, Mr. Acheson goes on.</text>
            <text syncTime="4945.356" offset="19781381">“Your recovery is based on an ordinary tort liability for defrauding under” -- and I'm quoting, “a formula resulting in the same fixed, absolute amount of each claimant regardless of the number of claimants.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4961.261" offset="19845016">I'm going to show that he has admitted that that isn't true in his reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4967.733" offset="19870929">Now, let's see whether the -- under this Court of Appeals formula, the setup for the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4974.152" offset="19896529">The claims is represented by petitioners “are to be paid in full,” as counsel says.</text>
            <text syncTime="4980.443" offset="19921711">Under a formula which produces the same fixed absolute amount, each claimant regardless the number of claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="4986.148" offset="19944490">Or whether under the prescribed, formula they're actually practically, factually interdependent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4994.618" offset="19978449">This formula provides first that only validly issued shares may participate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5003.176" offset="20012617">What follows is the critical part of the formula that they just ignored in their petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="5012.143" offset="20048562">The Court says, “Validly issued shares involved in the 1947 sale must include any arbitrarily retired” -- I underscore that language -- “arbitrarily retired by Black prior to set sale and of course must exclude the stock fictitiously issued.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5032.687" offset="20130691">“Arbitrarily retired,” they are the keywords in this formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="5041.458" offset="20165799">To determine which shares were arbitrarily retired and entitled to participate in the proceeds is necessary to determine on the evidence, if you please, what shares were fraudulently acquired, who was defrauded, and for how much.</text>
            <text syncTime="5063.608" offset="20254407">It's necessary to do that as they now concede in order to determine the recovery on every other claim against this property in the control of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5074.825" offset="20299233">Our chart on page 27 of the brief shows the interdependence of these claims under the Court's formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="5085.145" offset="20340506">Due to the fact, if you please, that the number of shares outstanding, the number of validly issued shares which include only those who were fraudulently acquired, the number of shares outstanding is a variable depending upon the determination of the merits of every other claim to that fund of which the Court has taken control.</text>
            <text syncTime="5108.487" offset="20433920">As shown in column two, if Amen shares the loan, had established the basis for recovery, the outturn to him would have been $81 per share.</text>
            <text syncTime="5119.182" offset="20476656">Taking the -- another -- the other extreme shown in column two on that chart, “If everybody before the Distinct Court who made a claim had been shown to be entitled to recover, the amount would have been $48.66.</text>
            <text syncTime="5132.748" offset="20530991">They all weren't permitted to recover.</text>
            <text syncTime="5134.784" offset="20539037">As a matter of fact, a lot of them were not by the District Court or he didn't' make findings that they've been deprived of their shares to a fraud and they appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5142.982" offset="20571847">And as to some that appealed, the Court said there that -- as to those few that they were defrauded, they were entitled to participate and what practical effect did that had?</text>
            <text syncTime="5153.931" offset="20615628">That enlarged the divisor, it reduced the per share out turn for every individual in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5159.959" offset="20639765">Now, that's what I call here interdependence as a matter of fact, the type of case which requires a court to take ancillary jurisdiction if he's disposed of the whole fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="5170.822" offset="20683233">That wide variation shows the degree of interdependence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5173.504" offset="20693995">Now, I want to summarize by saying this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5176.434" offset="20705698">There isn't just one element of interdependence here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5179.623" offset="20718446">There are three factors that make these claims interdependent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5185.050" offset="20740180">The amount of recovery on each individual claim depends on a determination of the merits of every other claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="5192.960" offset="20771840">That's one.</text>
            <text syncTime="5194.587" offset="20778318">The second is that all illegally and equitably outstanding shares here have a common right to participate in the proceeds of the sale that went to that fictitious 32,000 shares that Black issued secretly and fraudulent to himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="5212.776" offset="20851043">Now, there's the third type of interdependency.</text>
            <text syncTime="5216.309" offset="20865149">Some of Black's business cronies were permitted to stay in this thing until the sale, and to participate in the proceeds of the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="5227.882" offset="20911438">Their participation, of course like Black's, was very greatly increased by the arbitrary retirement of the shares of the Aledo group.</text>
            <text syncTime="5238.673" offset="20954593">That didn't go to swell Black's unjust enrichment, it went to those individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="5243.940" offset="20975700">And the result of it is that Black's unjust enrichment which is the property, the fund, upon which this Court has issued levy to constructive trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="5254.827" offset="21019272">It's less than the total loss of the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="5259.573" offset="21038289">And the result is, because of that discrepancy that -- if every claim here must be pro rata adjusted because the unjust enrichment is less than the total loss, so to those three types of interdependency.</text>
            <text syncTime="5278.882" offset="21115507">Now, in his reply brief, for the first time, prior to that time, Mr. Acheson has relied upon what somebody said in the early stages this case below or on what the Circuit Court of Appeals -- he comes to grips for the first time in his reply brief with the facts that determined whether there is truly interdependence or where there's not.</text>
            <text syncTime="5311.445" offset="21245701">Now, we submit that on pages 17 to 21 of his reply brief -- I like to underscore that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5320.087" offset="21280287">17 to 21 of his reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5323.195" offset="21292722">He shows that he finds it impossible to turn to the facts and to discuss the facts without conceding that there is indeed interdependence as between these claims to the fund upon which the Court impressed a constructive trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="5344.497" offset="21377985">Petitioner there acknowledges, as I'm going to point out to you, as our chart demonstrates, that the recovery on every claim here depends in literal fact upon a determination of the merits of every other claim of every other person seeking a right to participate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5367.510" offset="21469936">Brought face-to-face for the first time with the Court of Appeals formula which they had ignored in the three brief previously filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5375.594" offset="21502328">Brought face-to-face with it, the statement in the formula that only validly issued shares can participate and that it must be determined by the evidence as to each share whether it was fraudulently obtained and arbitrarily required in order to determine whether it was validly -- existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5392.846" offset="21571291">Face-to-face with that, they're brought to this striking confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="5397.607" offset="21590413">I'm going to put together a few sentence to this, in that portion of their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5403.530" offset="21614028">The total number of validly issued shares at liquidation is a fact to be determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="5411.112" offset="21644434">In determining the fact from the proof, a court must decide the number of validly issued shares at the time of liquidation, facts that go beyond an individual plaintiff's interest must be considered in working of the amount of recovery.</text>
