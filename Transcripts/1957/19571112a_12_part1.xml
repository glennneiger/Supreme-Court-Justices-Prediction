            <label>Mr. Charlie H. Johns, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="48.516" offset="194038">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.764" offset="203024">These appeals are from the judgment of a three-judge District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.919" offset="243670">The District Court set aside orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission prescribing interstate and intrastate fares for the Chicago suburban service of the Milwaukee railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.793" offset="319112">The Commission's order prescribing the intrastate fares was based upon a finding of an undue revenue discrimination against interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.521" offset="369998">As you know, Section 13, paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Interstate Commerce Act, provides among other things that if in an investigation of any intrastate rate, fare, practice, and so forth, the Commission finds that such a rate, practice or fare causes an undue discrimination against interstate commerce, it shall prescribe the fare, rate or practice which will remove such discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.049" offset="512104">The last case under Section 13 (4) which this Court had occasion to consider at oral argument was King versus United States referred to in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.482" offset="573858">As you will recall, in that case, the Commission had raised the intrastate freight rates in Florida in part at least to take care of this passenger deficit with which the railroads are faced.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.642" offset="646478">That passenger deficit continues today.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.405" offset="665600">And as we mentioned in the brief, the Commission is now engaged in a general investigation into that subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.595" offset="694335">The case here today involves one phase of that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.284" offset="725055">In the record, at page 5, is a map showing the setting of our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.900" offset="767582">The territory, in which the Milwaukee performs its suburban service, extends over its west line, a distance of 37 miles between Chicago and Elgin, Illinois, and over its north line, a distance of 73 miles between Chicago and Walworth, Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.527" offset="850024">There are only two intermediate -- interstate points involved, Walworth and Zenda, Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.367" offset="877401">On the west line, the railroad performs daily during the work week or I should say operates one train between Chicago and a point about half way at Bensenville, and 13 trains between Chicago and Elgin.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.439" offset="961724">On the north line, it operates three trains daily between Chicago and Deerfield, a point just north of the Cook County line, nine trains daily and this is in both directions between Chicago and Fox Lake, up in the lake area and one train daily between Chicago and Walworth, Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.199" offset="1048764">On the weekends, of course, the service is reduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.343" offset="1069349">The fares, both interstate and intrastate for this suburban service were before the Commission's orders and are now as a result of the Commission's orders on the same level.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.910" offset="1131624">The undisputed fact here today is that before the Commission issued its orders, this suburban service was not -- was failing by $306,000 to cover its out-of-pocket cost of over $2,200,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.920" offset="1227651">The case had its origin in 1952 when the railroad went to the State Commission requesting permission to take off some of its all power trains to consolidate other trains and to then to raise its fares by amount necessary to cover the out-of-pocket cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.476" offset="1321900">Its case there for an increase in fares was based primarily upon a showing of insufficient revenues to cover the cost and use an abbreviated cost study to prove its point in the belief that it could clearly show that this out-of-pocket cost was greater than the revenues it was getting from the service.</text>

            <text syncTime="783.579" offset="3134276">(2) Whether the Court could set aside the order approving the increases in the interstate fares.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.769" offset="3166981">Then the third question is whether the Commission's findings are sufficient to show an undue revenue discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.348" offset="3197388">And the fourth question is whether the evidence supports the finding that the prescribed fares will be just and reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.121" offset="3236467">I would first like to discuss this question of submitting the same evidence to both commissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.606" offset="3262380">The court below held in effect that the ICC, in an investigation involving an intrastate rate, must limit its consideration to the evidence introduced in a prior state proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="848.512" offset="3394038">Now, while the Court there is specifically referring to these cost items, the ruling is just as applicable to the Northwestern's fares which were put in at -- upon the insistence of the examiner and it is just as applicable to these questions which the Commission's cost finding staff presented to the railroad in which the railroad answered on the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="956.330" offset="3825267">There are several reasons while -- why the ruling of the lower court is unsound such as the fact that the two proceedings are conducted under different statutes and for different purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.893" offset="3883572">And the fact that time, the time element alone would require the railroad to bring this case up to date in the later ICC proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.232" offset="3920875">But we say here that the best reason is the ruling of this Court in the first Florida log case.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.873" offset="3947416">That's reported at 282 United States Report and it's referring to in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.364" offset="3969358">In that case, the Court -- this Court held that the Commission could prescribe an intrastate rate to remove an undue revenue discrimination where there hadn't even been prior state proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.292" offset="4025156">In that case, as you will recall, the Georgia Commission came to the ICC complaining of interstate rates on logs between Florida and Georgia and that the intrastate rate on logs for a distance up to 170 miles within Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.983" offset="4107912">The -- in the administrative proceeding, the Commission found that both rates need to be adjusted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.529" offset="4130064">It adjusted the interstate rate down and the intrastate rate up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.338" offset="4153260">The in -- the Florida intrastate rate had been voluntarily established by the carrier and the argument was made that since the rate had not been made or imposed by the State, within the wording of the statute, the ICC had no jurisdiction to order its -- it changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.593" offset="4230269">In ruling against that contention, this Court discussed the Government's changed philosophy towards the regulation of the railroads in the Transportation Act of 1920 and the authoritative duty of the railroad -- of the Commission to maintain a national railway system and the importance of the intrastate rates under such a scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.254" offset="4348970">The Court stated that the Commission's authority over intrastate rates is to be read in the light of the affirmative duty to fix rates and to take other important steps to maintain an adequate national railway system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.907" offset="4419605">And the Court said that to hold -- that the Commission could not act until the Court -- the State had first said in judgment upon the lawfulness of those rates would be repugnant to that grant of authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.791" offset="4487105">Under this affirmative duty and the duty exist today under the National Transportation Policy and under the Commission's rule of ratemaking, Section 15 (a) (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.406" offset="4537574">The Commission is not required to concern itself with any problem in a case like this other than whether on the evidence before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.742" offset="4582922">The intrastate rates do in fact cause an undue revenue discrimination against interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.285" offset="4617091">That affirmative duty cannot be performed satisfactorily if the investigation is to be limited to a record developed in some proceeding over which the ICC has no jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1470.623" offset="5882462">While the lower court does not question the Commission's finding that the revenues for the suburban service were failing by over $306,000 to -- to cover the out-of-pocket cost of that service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.377" offset="5941499">It held the justification for the exercise of the federal power did not clearly appear on this, because the Commission did not also specifically find what contribution from the suburban service would constitute a fair share of the railroad's total revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.615" offset="6030420">Now, as I'll point out in this argument, this Court, in the King's case held that such a specific finding was not essential in a case of this type.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.155" offset="6072529">This Court of course has stated that there are no formal requisites for findings in a case under Section 13 (3) and (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.709" offset="6114743">This Court has also stated that the findings on a Commission's report will vary with the statutory authority invoked and with the context of the situation presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.091" offset="6172317">We say that in the context of the situation presented here, these findings are applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.208" offset="6200738">The findings appear at pages 36 and 37 of the record, the Commission's formal finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.981" offset="6239922">The first finding is that the existing suburban fares did not produce enough revenue to cover the out-of-pocket cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.795" offset="6271164">There is no dispute here on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.247" offset="6288927">It's -- that formal finding is based upon a summary in the report of the cost study submitted by the railroad and by the commuters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.963" offset="6335843">The second finding is that the suburban fares imposed by the State caused in a less increase to the extent prescribed would continue to cause an undue revenue -- an undue discrimination against interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.486" offset="6397910">Now, the whole theory of the Commission's case is summed up, I think, in the second finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.033" offset="6424033">In other words, as the Commission points out at the bottom of page 36 of the record and going over to -- at the bottom of page 35 and going over on to 36, to the extent that this suburban service fails to meet the out-of-pocket cost and make all the contribution that it reasonably can to the respondent's indirect cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.461" offset="6517760">It -- it increases respondent's past through deficit and results in an undue burden upon its freight operations, state and interstate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1660.543" offset="6642103">In the Florida log case, this Court said that more was required that you have to study the revenues to see what the old rate was producing and what the new rates would produce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.277" offset="6689019">But that is the principal finding and I will discuss in just a moment, I think, this Court's past opinion support that holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.432" offset="6741682">The third formal finding is that the undue discrimination can and should be removed by establishing fares not lower than those prescribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.532" offset="6778044">Now, in this case, the Commission thought that a 21% increase would cover all of the proven out-of-pocket cost and contribute a little to the indirect cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.349" offset="6825378">The fourth formal finding is that the prescribed fares are just unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.063" offset="6844186">That can be supported by the cost evidence here alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.311" offset="6865189">While I make that statement on the brief, I cite no authority for it but this Court has recognized the fact that a cost study will support a finding of reasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.318" offset="6905208">The case to which I refer and which is not cited in the briefs is the old -- Illinois Commerce Commission case involving the Chicago switching charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.880" offset="6943451">It's reported at 292 United States Report, page 474 and my particular page reference is page 484.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.487" offset="6981904">The finding goes ahead to say that the prescribed fares will produce substantial additional revenue that's based upon a discussion in the report and in the record, showing that over the years, the patronage of this carrier and this service has been increasing and that it continued to increase after the last fare increase in 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.829" offset="7071242">The Commission was afraid, however, that the railroad's request for a 29% increase would adversely affect the movement of this traffic and wasn't willing to go that high.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.600" offset="7114397">Therefore, it gave them 21%, roughly 21% increase which would deal substantially more revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.201" offset="7148774">That finding goes ahead to say that these prescribed fares are necessary to afford a fare contribution towards the indirect cost and return and to enable the carrier to provide adequate and efficient service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.325" offset="7201228">The Commission also found that the interstate suburban fares increased on the same level would be just and reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.433" offset="7237695">The lower court thought that the findings were inadequate because the report contains no specific finding of what contribution from the suburban fares would constitute a fare proportion of the railroad's total income, and as we point out on brief, this Court in the King case indicated that no specific finding was essential.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.980" offset="7335915">The lower court realizing that, then said, "Well, there is no finding here that the revenue produced by the intrastate fares will contribute not more than a fair proportion of the total income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.314" offset="7393176">We think that findings that the increases prescribed will be just and reasonable and are necessary so that travel there under may make a fair contribution, is the equivalent of a finding that they will contribute not more than a fair proportion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.162" offset="7460571">The -- the Court also criticized the findings because it's -- this last finding is based upon a fair contribution towards indirect cost and return rather than a fair contribution towards the total income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.130" offset="7536431">We think that when you're dealing with a losing portion of the business and you're trying to cover the cost -- the out-of-pocket cost and get some contribution to the indirect cost that the phrase of fair contribution towards an indirect cost is more appropriate than the phrase "fair contribution to the total income."</text>

            <text syncTime="2005.105" offset="8020323">The views of this Court in past cases, I believe, support the proposition that a showing of a non-compensatory rate plus a showing that a reasonable increase in that rate will produce substantially more revenues are adequate to support a finding of an undue revenue discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.720" offset="8134844">For example, in the first Florida log case, this Court held that the showing of a non-remunerative rate was not sufficient to support a finding of discrimination that you had to have more.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.309" offset="8189179">And the Court went ahead to say that the more needed was the study of the revenues to see what had been produced -- what were to be produced under the increased rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.510" offset="8230034">See if it's going to be substantial and if that is necessary to eliminate this discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.425" offset="8261695">In the North Carolina case, involving the fares of four railroads, passenger fares of four railroads in that State during World War II, this Court said that the order in the second Florida log case, incidentally the Court set aside the order in the first Florida log case because we haven't made this revenue study.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.708" offset="8366811">The Commission took the case back and made the revenue study, issued another order and this Court upheld that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.401" offset="8393561">And in the North Carolina case, in explaining why the order in the second Florida log case was upheld, this Court said that that order in the second Florida log case was based upon a finding supported by evidence, that the intrastate rate was abnormally low, less than reasonably compensatory, insufficient under all the circumstances and conditions to cover the full cost of the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.824" offset="8515291">Now, there's -- this Court said in North Carolina was why the Florida log order was upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.459" offset="8541832">Insufficient under all circumstances to cover the full cost of the service that was one commodity in Florida moving a maximum distance over 170 miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.155" offset="8588539">And in the King case, the Court seems to have taken it for granted that the Commission's jurisdiction extends to a non-compensatory rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.493" offset="8621871">There at one place, the Court states near the last part of the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.821" offset="8639216">The C -- ICC's jurisdiction over intrastate rates, however, is not limited to cases where those rates are non-compensatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.264" offset="8672967">And then, in the dissenting opinion in the King case, Mr. Justice Douglas, gave an example of what he considers to be undue revenue discrimination against interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.336" offset="8725316">And here is what he said by way of example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.939" offset="8743706">If intrastate freight operations fail to produce an adequate return as determined by reference to the cost of the intrastate operations and the investment in the intrastate business, interstate commerce is discriminated against.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.063" offset="8816222">If that is an undue revenue discrimination, we have an aggravated case of it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.675" offset="8854674">We submit that in the context of the situation presented here, the finding relative to undue -- revenue discrimination is ample.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.224" offset="8900859">We believe that other findings, if added, would in the words of the District Court in the New Haven Commutation Fares case cited in the brief, simply amount to a piling on of more words without an essential change in substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.384" offset="8973479">Time does not permit me to discuss these other two points involving the basis for the Commission's finding that these increased fares will be just and reasonable as I've said before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.359" offset="9021336">I think the cost alone supports it or the propriety of setting aside the interstate order which is not connected in any way whatsoever with this question of discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="2327.038" offset="9308056">In other words, it goes right along with this Court's view in the Florida log case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.313" offset="9329162">This Court said in the Florida log case that in a revenue discrimination case, we are not concerned with the relation of rates.</text>

            <text syncTime="3328.171" offset="13312627">They are receiving service which cause the railroad 3 cents a passenger mile to perform on a full cost basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.733" offset="13338854">At the time of this -- of the hearing by the Interstate Commerce Commission, they were paying only one and six tenth cents of that cost.</text>

            <text syncTime="3352.068" offset="13408235">Therefore, since these rates went into effect on April 20, 1956, these commuters have been excused from paying over $1,750,000 of the full cost rendering the service and they are now seeking by this proceeding here to compel the railroad to refund another $575,000 out of the already inadequate fares which they have paid to the railroad and they will thereby increase the bargain which they are receiving at the hands of the railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.601" offset="13550341">Now, the Interstate Commerce Commission is directed by Congress to administer the Interstate Commerce Act so as to encourage transportation -- to encourage reasonable charges for transportation without unjust discrimination and to foster sound economic conditions among the carriers subject to its regulation, all to the end of developing and preserving a national transportation system, adequate to meet the needs of the commerce of the United States, of the postal system and of the national defense.</text>

            <text syncTime="4333.894" offset="17335484">The report states that the passenger service has a large deficit of approximately $23 million while the freight service has a substantial profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4344.910" offset="17379579">The finding is that the suburban service provides revenue of $1,800,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="4351.604" offset="17406328">So far, as the report itself shows, the interstate passengers could have been transported for nothing while the intrastate suburban passengers contributed a $1,800,000 to the total revenues of the Milwaukee Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="4366.525" offset="17466096">However, we know that there is no such ridiculous situation as that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4371.564" offset="17486158">While the Interstate Commission's report does not mention, the 1954 annual report to the Interstate Commerce Commission of the railroad was stipulated to be in the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4382.521" offset="17530044">And that report shows that the total passenger revenue was $14,906,000 while the passenger deficit was $22,800,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="4398.128" offset="17592424">Now, we believe that the words discrimination against interstate commerce mean something and mean what they say.</text>
            <text syncTime="4405.385" offset="17621473">In other words, discrimination is a difference of treatment, an unjust or an unequal distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4411.312" offset="17645192">Some comparative analysis must be drawn to demonstrate the discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4417.909" offset="17671628">An analysis based upon facts of the record and not a mere conclusory statement that there was discrimination against interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="4426.750" offset="17706945">Now, keeping in mind the figures which the report shows, we have first a suburban deficit of $306,000 as found by the Commission against a suburban revenue of $1,800,000 considerable more revenue than deficit, while the total passenger revenue of $14,916,000 is considerably less than the passenger deficit of $22,800,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="4458.690" offset="17834736">Now, even if you take the so-called fully distributed passenger suburban deficit by adding an extra million dollars to the $130 -- to the $306,000 out-of-pocket cost, we still have more revenue than deficit in the intrastate service while we have just the opposite in the interstate service.</text>
            <text syncTime="4481.464" offset="17925851">If there is discrimination, it would be that the discrimination is against the suburban service and not against the interstate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4489.824" offset="17959288">You might look at it in another way.</text>
            <text syncTime="4492.065" offset="17968170">The suburban revenues of $1,800,000 is 12% of the total passenger revenues while the suburban deficit, even on a fully distributed faces of a hundred -- of $1,300,000 is only 6% of a passenger deficit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4512.042" offset="18048104">While we believe that the interstate's report itself must contain the basic findings as to the intrastate fair proportionate share, actual findings of fact which tend to show a failure to sustain such a proportional burden and in the absence of any such finding, it is not necessary to look at the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4532.115" offset="18128457">Yet, there are other facts from the evidence itself which tend to even more dispel any discrimination against interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="4541.913" offset="18167641">The annual report of the railroad which was stipulated in the evidence shows that while the passengers carried other than commutation or suburban passenger, fell from $7,500,000 in 1945 to $3 million in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="4559.483" offset="18237858">And the revenue fell from $36 million in 1945 to $13,500,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="4565.865" offset="18263458">This is other than commutation in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="4569.744" offset="18278922">The commutations are suburban business increase substantially in both total passengers and in revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="4579.602" offset="18318315">Nor do we believe, Your Honors, that the freight service has any bearing upon a comparison to determine a discrimination by the passenger suburban service against interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="4592.933" offset="18371709">That would be almost like comparing bananas with bicycle.</text>
            <text syncTime="4597.315" offset="18389159">There is no showing at all what the intrastate freight revenues or expenses amount to or what the intrastate freight contributes as to the total net earnings.</text>

            <text syncTime="5078.050" offset="20312189">Here, however, we find that the intrastate rate set by the interstate commission is higher than the interstate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5086.237" offset="20344895">The report itself showed that the one-way coach fares intrastate are fixed at 3 cents per mile with a minimum of 25 cents whereas the interstate fares are on the basis of two and a half cents per mile with a 15-cent minimum.</text>
            <text syncTime="5102.832" offset="20411246">Therefore, in the absence of any, in our opinion, rate disparity are factual discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="5111.598" offset="20446354">The report must be looked at for what it actually is.</text>
            <text syncTime="5116.076" offset="20464222">A proceeding before the Interstate Commission with a determination by the Commission upon the evidence submitted to them and upon the allocation of cost as they determine that the intrastate suburban service operates at a loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="5134.715" offset="20538828">That, to us, is the fundamental issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5140.182" offset="20560666">Can the Interstate Commerce Commission exercise jurisdiction over an intrastate rate simply because they find it non-compensatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="5152.206" offset="20608731">In Florida versus United State, 282 U.S., Chief Justice Hughes answered that question specifically in the negative.</text>
            <text syncTime="5162.851" offset="20651363">He stated, "But to justify the Commission in the alteration of intrastate rates, it was not enough for the Commission to find that the existing intrastate rates on a particular traffic were not enumerative or reasonably compensatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="5179.089" offset="20716356">The authority to determine the reasonableness per se of intrastate rates lay with the state authorities and not with the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="5189.220" offset="20756793">Any departure from that decision would change Section 13 (4) requiring a discrimination against interstate commerce into a straight Section 15 (1) rate proceeding based upon a mere cost of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="5203.945" offset="20815726">And at the same time would, for all practical purposes, repeal by implication the reservation in Section 1 which preserves the right of the several states to regulate intrastate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="5217.862" offset="20871419">I think at this point, the language of this Court in Palmer versus Massachusetts in 308 U.S. which we didn't cite in our brief but which was a question of the bankruptcies court power over intra -- over the railroad station closing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5233.688" offset="20934740">But it spoke about the conflict between the State and the federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5238.907" offset="20955533">This Court stated, "At best this is subtle business calling for great wariness less -- what professes to be mere rendering, becomes creation and attempted interpretation of legislation becomes legislation itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="5254.951" offset="21019794">Especially if wariness enjoined when the problem of construction implicates one of the recurring faces of our federalism and thus striking a balance between national and state authority in one of the most sensitive areas of government.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5269.946" offset="21079771">Therefore, a construing legislation, this Court has disfavored inroads by implication on state authority and recently confined restrictions upon the traditional power of states to regulate their local transportation to the plain mandate of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="5287.726" offset="21150824">The plain mandate of Congress in Section 13 (4) is removal of undue discrimination against interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="5298.522" offset="21194083">As it was stated in the very first case, in the Wisconsin Commission case, the action of the interstate commerce should be directed to substantial disparity which operates as a real discrimination against an obstruction to interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="5317.895" offset="21271510">In the North Carolina case, this Court specifically said neither Section 13 (4) nor any other congressional legislation indicates a purpose to attempt wholly to deprive the states of their primary authority to regulate interstate -- intrastate rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5334.576" offset="21338279">A scrupulous regard for maintaining the power of the State in this field has caused this Court to require that Interstate Commerce Commission orders giving precedents to federal right must meet a high standard of certainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="5350.297" offset="21401182">We respectfully submit that the report of the Interstate Commerce Commission in this case does not meet that high degree of certainty which shows that there is a real discrimination against our obstruction to interstate commerce on the record here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5367.700" offset="21470772">While a state should not be enjoined -- should not enjoy the earnings from interstate commerce to support intrastate commerce, the state should only be called upon to furnish compensation for the intrastate business, reasonably proportionate to that for the interstate business.</text>
            <text syncTime="5388.526" offset="21554051">If proportionate contribution in relation to interstate, our total income is not necessary, then the reasonableness of the rate becomes the ability to pay and the value of the service becomes what the traffic will bear instead of an effort to remove a real discrimination against interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="5413.563" offset="21654152">If the National Transportation Policy under the Interstate Commerce Act is to be that all intrastate rates must be compensatory then Congress should amend that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5429.257" offset="21716950">Legislative usurpation by the Interstate Commerce Commission along that line should not be tolerated or sanctioned by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5440.881" offset="21763448">The State Commission, I can assure you, are fully aware of the need for an efficient, strong, and adequate transportation system.</text>
            <text syncTime="5451.882" offset="21807438">Mass transportation which is involved in this suburban fare cases is important to the national interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="5460.730" offset="21842860">The problems of traffic congestion and the large loss of life in traffic accidents which exist in peacetime and the need to move people to and from work, in wartime with gas rationing require in the public interest the promotion and continuance of adequate mass transportation service at reasonable rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="5483.679" offset="21934707">Exacting some subsidy, even if we assume that the service operates at a loss from the freight service for mass commuters service is justifiable as requiring the freight service to support interstate passenger service.</text>
            <text syncTime="5497.975" offset="21991863">The Interstate Commerce Commission is not the only expert body which is capable of exercising an informed judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5507.906" offset="22031569">There is one other point that I would like to touch on, on behalf of the state and that is the lower court held that if different evidence is to be offered or a different basis is to be urged before the Interstate Commission, the State Commission should have been given a chance to fix rates on the same evidence in the same basis.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harry R. Begley</label>
            <text syncTime="5534.188" offset="22136686">All right, fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="5534.962" offset="22139820">The factual situation in this place clearly supports this proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="5540.713" offset="22162808">As we have pointed out, there is no real discrimination against interstate commerce but merely a claim non-compensatory intrastate rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5551.748" offset="22206903">If a railroad can come before the State Commission and put in a case which fails to show any loss and then go to the Interstate Commission and put in a different case on expenditure which may show an actual loss, with the Interstate Commission making a report which gives the State Commission 30 days to adopt the interstate finding or else be hit with a Section 4 -- 13 (4) affirmative order then all semblance of state authority over inter -- intrastate rates disappear.</text>
            <text syncTime="5583.155" offset="22332604">The clear reservation of state power over intrastate rates found in Section 1 becomes a nullity and the State Commission is not even a way station in the journey to the Interstate Commerce Commission as the lower court said but is reduced to a mere bulletin board for the posting of the Interstate Commerce Commission order.</text>
            <text syncTime="5604.566" offset="22418181">Thank you.</text>
