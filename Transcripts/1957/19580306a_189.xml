            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">Number 189, Milton Knapp versus Mitchell D. Schweitzer, Judge of the Court of General Sessions, and Frank S. Hogan.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.697" offset="78785">You might wait just a moment, Mr. Kurtpatrick, until they get seated.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.834" offset="163318">Mr. Kurtpatrick, you may proceed now.</text>

            <label>Mr. Bernard H. Fitzpatrick</label>
            <text syncTime="43.291" offset="173140">Fitzpatrick.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.977" offset="191843">If the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.812" offset="199158">We are seeking to review here a sentence of fine and imprisonment imposed upon a conviction for contempt in the Court of General Sessions of New York County.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.049" offset="264150">The Court of General Sessions is, of course, our major criminal court within the county and it has a pendent to it a grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.717" offset="314828">The petitioner, Knapp, is an employer in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.856" offset="339383">Now, as the Court has had occasion to have cases under it, there is this Section 302 of the Taft-Hartley Act which makes it a crime for an employer to pay to any representative of a labor union any money if the enterprise is in an industry affecting commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.684" offset="434678">There is no question that this enterprise was in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.082" offset="460278">The grand jury asked the petitioner a series of questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.059" offset="484206">I won't go through the series at this point, but I will say that they were directed to ascertaining whether Knapp had paid any money to one Goldberg, a labor organizer of his employees or one Goldstein, another official of the same union which contracted with his firm.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.057" offset="576157">Knapp declined to answer on the grounds that the answers might incriminate him, this of course, in the privacy of the grand jury, originally.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.228" offset="616908">And he persisted in his refusal and the grand jury granted him immunity under a New York State statute providing as many States do for the grant of immunity in cases involving extortion and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.810" offset="691200">He still declined to answer, still asserting the ground and he was brought before the respondent, Judge Schweitzer, upon a motion to instruct him to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.311" offset="737176">Now, at this face of the case, he was represented by counsel, and counsel interposed specifically the objection that his refusal to answer was grounded on the liability of implication under the Taft-Hartley Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.339" offset="813349">Notwithstanding that and over the objection of counsel to that effect, the witness was instructed to answer and ultimately, since he still persisted in his refusal, a motion was made to punish him for contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.647" offset="878550">Upon the motion to punish for contempt, counsel again reiterated the objection, specifically that Section 302 of the Taft-Hartley Act was the matter involved, that under the New York State Constitution, of course, which is in longer in question before this Court, went under the Fifth Amendment of the Federal Constitution as applied through the Supremacy and through the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, he was privileged to refuse to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.781" offset="1035076">That is in short, a very simple fact situation that we have to deal with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.046" offset="1064124">He was found guilty and sentenced to imprisonment for 30 days and a fine of $250 was imposed on him.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.560" offset="1110204">Now, the first point that I would like to deal with is the reality of the petitioner's peril that has been a constant question not raised by us but raised by our opponents all the way up.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.735" offset="1170913">The questions which were asked of this petitioner appear on page 12 and 13 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.113" offset="1212395">I'll quote some of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.210" offset="1224829">“Now, who represented the union in these negotiations leading to a salary increase?</text>
            <text syncTime="312.645" offset="1250534">Mr. Knapp - Do you know a man named Philip Goldberg?</text>
            <text syncTime="316.805" offset="1267148">Mr. Knapp - Do you know whether Philip Goldberg is an official of Local 239, International Brotherhood of Teamsters?</text>
            <text syncTime="324.306" offset="1297136">Mr. Knapp - On or about October 28th, 1955, did you give Philip Goldberg, a representative of Local 239, International Brotherhood of Teamsters the sum of $500?</text>
            <text syncTime="339.267" offset="1357009">Mr. Knapp - I show you this check marked as an exhibit in the sum of $500 and ask you whether you recognize it.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.575" offset="1390237">Mr. Knapp - On or about October 28th, 1955, did you go to the Public National Bank and Trust Company at 149th Street in Prospect Avenue and cashed this check, grand jury Exhibit No. 1, and received from the bank a sum of $500?</text>
            <text syncTime="367.182" offset="1468709">Mr. Knapp - Do you know a man by the name of Samuel Goldstein?</text>
            <text syncTime="377.664" offset="1510609">Isn't it a fact that Samuel Goldstein is an official of Local 239, International Brotherhood of Teamsters?</text>
            <text syncTime="384.031" offset="1536104">Did you ever pay or give any sum of money to Samuel Goldstein?”</text>
            <text syncTime="390.505" offset="1562018">Equipped with affirmative answers to those -- that series of questions any tyro of a district attorney in the federal service could draw an information under Section 302 of the Taft-Hartley Act.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="406.342" stopTime="411.965">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="406.342" offset="1625339">Mr. Fitzpatrick, was that -- was that a public offense in New York -- in the State of New York?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="bernard_h_fitzpatrick" startTime="411.965" stopTime="464.196">
            <label>Mr. Bernard H. Fitzpatrick</label>
            <text syncTime="411.965" offset="1647804">Yes, there is such concomitant offense, if Your Honor will recall, we originally came up on appeal on a question of preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.809" offset="1679151">You dismissed the appeal and allowed us to raise it.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.002" offset="1707990">So, there is no question that the grand jury from a purely state viewpoint have the right to inquire into these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.255" offset="1772983">I've said -- I remark that the questions are such as to bear directly on the commission of a federal crime, not only on the commission of a federal crime, but on the commission of the crime by this witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.241" offset="1852918">Now --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="464.196" stopTime="468.953">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="464.196" offset="1856784">When he asserted the privilege originally, did he specify the Taft-Hartley Act?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="bernard_h_fitzpatrick" startTime="468.953" stopTime="1894.538">
            <label>Mr. Bernard H. Fitzpatrick</label>
            <text syncTime="468.953" offset="1875801">He did, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.742" offset="1878936">That -- that is not in the privacy of the jury room.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.079" offset="1896281">He is not represented by counsel at the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.735" offset="1906939">At the first instance when he was represented by counsel, that was specified and it was reiterated on the motion to punish for contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.513" offset="1953959">Now, unlike some other cases which will be cited before the Court, there was no geographic remoteness here.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.908" offset="2011533">This man was right within the geographic limits of the federal jurisdiction in which he could be convicted for the very crime inquired.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.722" offset="2058867">You'll hear from me, perhaps, and from my one of adversaries, I'm certain of King of the Two Sicilies against Willcox where a geographic barrier existed where expedition proceedings would have been necessary to render the witness liable to the penalties of the Sicilian courts and where anyhow, the English court didn't know what the Sicilian law was.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.700" offset="2166700">None of that is in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.564" offset="2174224">Here is the man before a court which is administering a law of the State of New York and he cites a federal statute which puts him in peril.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.517" offset="2226051">That federal statute is as much domestic law within the State of New York as any law passed by its own legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.835" offset="2263249">And the District Attorney who is supposed to prosecute him by duty bound to prosecute him under the federal law is perhaps three blocks away.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.105" offset="2320405">Nor is there any unusual process here.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.358" offset="2333362">You'll hear from my adversaries, I believe, about Queen -- Queen against Boyes where an English -- in an English court a man who had been -- was a recipient of the Queen's pardon was made to testify despite his plea that the Queen's pardon could not override a possible parliamentary impeachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.816" offset="2451226">Now, there was a use of a -- suggested use of a very dormant legal weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.653" offset="2478602">Here, we have a vivid, alive prosecutor set to use the law of the United States by the normal process of information and indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.020" offset="2540042">Not only that but under the holding in the Feldman case of this Court, the testimony that he would be compelled to give would be usable verbatim and we do not question the soundness of the Feldman case.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.729" offset="2614857">As a matter of fact, were it not for the Feldman case, we would not be here.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.779" offset="2635024">So that, the proximity of the peril is as great as any proximity that a man questioned in our Federal District Court on the same subject might be subjected.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.529" offset="2710047">In that circumstance, we resorted to the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.045" offset="2744111">The substance of that, the part that we invoked of course reads, “No person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.”</text>
            <text syncTime="697.808" offset="2791131">Now, at the very minimum, that criminal case there means a federal criminal case, that is that the individual shall not be subjected in any federal criminal case to the compulsion of giving testimony against himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.455" offset="2885799">That is his primary right.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.795" offset="2891128">His primary right is not so much a right to refuse to testify as it is the right to protect himself from prosecution based upon compelled testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.176" offset="2940656">And we know that because in all the circumstances where his criminal liability is aborted, such as where an immunity statute is operative and he's given immunity, or where a pardon has taken away the criminal block, or where the statute of limitations has grown against a particular crime involved, and all those circumstances and several others, the privilege disappears.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.352" offset="3065313">Now, the privilege to testify therefore is ancillary to that primary right and that primary right is a federal right.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.380" offset="3105437">The right that we are asserting here is a right which is ancillary -- it's true whether it's ancillary to this man's right to protect himself from federal prosecution by declining to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.083" offset="3196238">That ancillary right, of course, extends beyond a person proceeded against, it extends to a witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.518" offset="3234064">It extends to a person in civil proceedings called as a witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.383" offset="3261440">It extends to a person before Congressional Committees and the Court has had many of them here in recent years.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.663" offset="3298638">Committees where the function is purely inquisitorial, no thought of prosecution exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.371" offset="3333433">The Committee of Congress or any similar legislative body does not have the power to indict or to initiate prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.218" offset="3372826">Nevertheless, a witness is there entitled to assert that he need not testify where the circumstances might incriminate him.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.886" offset="3423504">Now, we infer from that that the Fifth Amendment has created in the individual, a right and it is our assertion that no state may by affirmative action interfere with his exercise of that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.671" offset="3550668">The right is exclusively addressed to the action -- possible action of a federal prosecutor, but it can, of course, be interfered with by the state authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.869" offset="3607406">They can put him on the stand, they can produce a line of testimony which can be used to his condemnation by the federal prosecutor and it can be used verbatim.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.142" offset="3664562">Now, if that right follows him, not only into the civil courts, not only into administrative bodies, not only into the Halls of Congress itself, why does it stop at the state line has the respondent's contempt?</text>
            <text syncTime="939.271" offset="3757035">The answer they give is that the Fifth Amendment is not binding on the states and as applied to testimonial matters, there is a two sovereignties doctrine, sometimes referred to as a dual sovereignty doctrine which renders the state so independent of the federal government that it need not respect the right here asserted.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.779" offset="3895066">Now, it is true that Barron against Baltimore held that the Federal Bill of Rights as such was not applicable to the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.496" offset="3941982">But that is not the position that we are contending here -- for here.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.833" offset="3967269">We do not take the position here that the States must grant in the administration of their own domestic affairs, parallel protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.250" offset="4016901">That is the framers of the Constitution have not in the Fifth -- the first 10 Amendments written a super constitution from the State, for the States which binds them in all their domestic affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.639" offset="4078550">All we are contending is the limited view that where a federal function is involved, the State has no right to interfere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.223" offset="4136856">From Barron against Baltimore, we take the argument to Crandall against Nevada.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.752" offset="4162978">That was a case in which the tax -- a tax levied upon egress from Nevada, a passenger transit tax levied upon egress from Nevada was held void by this Court for the reason that it interfered with the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.536" offset="4262139">It interfered with their right among other things to petition the Government, since in many cases to effectively petition the Government, you have to leave Nevada.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.833" offset="4319295">In that sense, it has been held that the States are in the position where they can affirmatively interfere with the exercise of a federal right under the first 10 Amendments and it is our assertion that this -- this case now before the bar is just such a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.354" offset="4405394">We offer some analogies which may not be too fanciful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.305" offset="4429218">We say that the position of the respondents here -- on the position of respondents here, they would have to maintain, that for instance, that the state could levy a tax on a demand for a federal jury trial in a civil case, a right which is protected by one of the first 10 Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.326" offset="4509257">We'd say that the State would have the right to put a heavy tax on the furnishing of bail in a federal court as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.085" offset="4552307">In other words, what we are contending for is that very limited functional application of the first 10 Amendments among them the Fifth, which merely holds that the State is powerless to interfere with the exercise by an individual of a right which hinges upon his relationship to the federal government and the right here hinges upon such a relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.475" offset="4677799">Now, let me speak for a moment on the so-called dual sovereignty doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.264" offset="4720953">This dual sovereignty doctrine got its start in a rather side comment and over the dicta of the Court in Brown against Walker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.613" offset="4774452">I may say that we do not assail Brown against Walker, which has been recently reaffirmed by the Court, we accept it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.959" offset="4819801">But Brown against Walker was a case which was decided on the supremacy theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.616" offset="4854387">The immunity statute which lay at the foundation of that case was held to bar State action.Wherefore, the plea of Brown on his habeas corpus had to be denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.823" offset="4927216">However, the Court unfortunately made a reference there which I shall not now quote, to the distinctness of the sovereignties, the state and federal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.422" offset="4993672">Now, I might say that prior to Brown and Walker, the only decided case of a consequence was United States against Saline Bank and that was a bill of discovery in a federal District Court to which a special plea was put in to the effect that the answers to the bill of discovery would tend to incriminate the defendants under the law of Virginia, and that plea was sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.088" offset="5112268">In other words, the federal courts were not going about compelling answers to questions which would prove incriminating in the state jurisdictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.137" offset="5164513">Of course, Brown against Walker was no departure from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.552" offset="5178201">It recognized that an immunization by the federal government was sufficiently plenary to bar all the prosecution involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.927" offset="5231700">Now, in the 1905 term, there were three cases decided, Hale against Henkel, Walman against Fagan, and Jack against Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.282" offset="5285094">The heavy reliance of our adversaries is on Jack against Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.352" offset="5301394">That was a case which came up from the Kansas courts and it grew out of an investigation by Kansas into infractions of the local antitrust laws, the sale of coal within a particular county in Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.225" offset="5388852">This Court held that it had nothing before it which showed that any matter of interstate commerce was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.890" offset="5435559">Therefore, a plea of possible incrimination on the federal law would not operate as a bar to the Kansas questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.180" offset="5480699">In other words, they held in substance that the record was not adequate to support the claim of federal incrimination because no question would be asked concerning interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.725" offset="5538900">Of course, you might say that that was decided at a day when the separation between interstate and state -- and intrastate commerce was, perhaps, more marked than it is today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.164" offset="5596578">However, while this Court held to that effect, it again reiterated some of the dual sovereignty language which originated in Brown against Walker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.330" offset="5649241">But at the same term, Walman against Fagan was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.652" offset="5666586">That was a case where before a federal grand jury, a witness successfully pleaded that his answers would tend to incriminate him under the bucket shop laws of Ohio and its plea was sustained here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.665" offset="5734609">And hardly enough, one of the cases cited to sustain his plea was the very case that we've just mentioned, Jack against Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.212" offset="5784764">Hale against Henkel, again, itself was decided on the basis of the Supremacy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.055" offset="5820186">That related to the production of documents and while the key point was whether a corporation or whether an officer could plea the right of the corporation to avoid self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.674" offset="5870655">Nonetheless, the subordinate point was that there might be incriminating matter on the State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.927" offset="5895628">The Court, relying on Brown against Walker, decided that on a supremacy basis but again reiterated some of the dual sovereignty language and it made an error as to the English law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.568" offset="5922168">Let me advert to the English law for a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.061" offset="5980160">The leading case cited by the adversaries here is King of the Two Sicilies against Willcox.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.769" offset="6015060">That was an English discovery proceeding brought for the ultimate recovery of some vessels which apparently had been taken in the course of the revolution by or on behalf of the defendants or they'd come to rest in the hands of the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.214" offset="6096771">The defendants pleaded the possibility of incrimination under Sicilian law and the Vice-Chancellor did not honor their plea holding that Sicilian Law was too far away, holding that unless they voluntarily return to Sicily, they were not exposed, holding that in any event he didn't know what the English law, what the Sicilian law was and therefore, he couldn't be expected to sustain a plea on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.440" offset="6233757">However, in United States against McCray, King of the Two Sicilies against Willcox was specifically overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.581" offset="6286315">Now, the McCray case grew out of our own Civil War.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.871" offset="6307422">McCray was the English fiscal representative of the confederacy, and after the war claiming as successor of the confederacy, we brought a bill of discovery against McCray.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.135" offset="6376490">McCray, in the English Court -- Court of Appeal, successfully pleaded incrimination under the laws of the United States so that the English -- the Hale against Henkel case starts the error as to the English law but believing that based on King of the Two Sicilies against Willcox.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.942" offset="6475755">Now, that error is important because it appears again in the next federal -- in the next United States case decide, that is United States against Murdock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.886" offset="6527478">They repeat King of the Two Sicilies against Willcox and either never saw or they did see it, ignored the overruling United States against McCray.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.905" offset="6579618">The Murdock case was a failure to furnish tax information to the Internal Revenue Department and a special plea was taken there to which a demurrer was had and this Court sustained in effect to demur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.283" offset="6649104">In other words, compelling Murdock to answer, although, his testimony would expose him to prosecution under the gambling laws of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.730" offset="6702916">Now, it refers -- the Murdock case refers to the Supremacy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.937" offset="6747742">It says, “Investigations for federal purposes may not be prevented by matters depending upon State law, Constitution Article 6, Section 2.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.606" offset="6806361">But here it comes out with the dual sovereignty principle full blown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.899" offset="6839589">The principle established is that full and complete immunity against prosecution by the Government compelling the witness to answer is equivalent to the protection furnished by the rule against compulsory self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.334" offset="6905313">Now, there you have the doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.178" offset="6932689">The doctrine was followed in the Feldman case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.105" offset="6948362">Now, we do not quarrel with the result in the Feldman case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.792" offset="6971141">That was an instance in which in a judgment creditors proceeding in New York, facts were adduced showing the party guilty of mail fraud and they were used, as was his testimony, verbatim against him to convict him of mail fraud in a federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.973" offset="7063824">The New York court had elicited the testimony from him under an immunity statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.926" offset="7091618">Feldman did not, so far as the record discloses, plead any involvement with federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.659" offset="7126622">In other words, he did not assert before the New York court any federal right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.249" offset="7152953">Now, if all that Feldman did, the Feldman case did was to hold that the State of New York cannot immunize against a federal crime, we would have no quarrel with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.558" offset="7218155">But in the language of Feldman case, the dual sovereignties doctrine is picked up and reiterated much in the language that I have read to you from Murdock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.267" offset="7260996">As a matter of fact, Murdock is specifically cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.223" offset="7284820">So, here we are with the last in the series of cases or the latest in the series of cases and we have a doctrine which started out by being dicta in cases properly decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.506" offset="7357962">As a matter of fact, I said to my associate before I came in here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.550" offset="7378129">I'm not trying to get the Court really to overturn any decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.602" offset="7398400">I'm get -- I'm here to get them to straighten out 50 years of loose talk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.227" offset="7428807">There is hardly any of the decisions in the whole line which cannot be supported on an adequate basis, usually, the basis of federal supremacy; that is that where testimony is compelled federally, the state court is obliged to accept the result of the federal immunization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.662" offset="7530580">Now, that was your holding in Adams against Maryland, of course, under specific statute preventing the use of evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1987.465" offset="7949793">Here, our record, I think, supports our claim very much better than the -- that in Jack case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.542" offset="7990126">Now, let me say one other thing about this dual sovereignty doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.576" offset="8010292">It appears to be an anomaly as well as a fallacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.525" offset="8034011">That is to say no other field of our jurisprudence have we developed a dual sovereignty doctrine other than the double jeopardy cases and self-incrimination cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.206" offset="8104751">And even in those cases, the dual sovereignty doctrine is applied only where the party stands naked and alone in his reliance on the Constitution where you have a statutory intervention such as you had in Adams against Maryland and the supremacy doctrine takes its place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.121" offset="8208405">So that in addition to which relates its foundation on the English law, in addition to its being the outgrowths of dicta in the cases with no actual decision and no necessity for decision, we have a situation where the dual sovereignty doctrine is an anomaly as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="2328.928" offset="9315683">Unless certain very basic and very well settled principles which have been promulgated by this Court are to be suddenly overturned and entirely rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.944" offset="9379736">I respectfully submit that there should be no doubt whatsoever as to the outcome of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.808" offset="9407216">My argument here is very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.382" offset="9421427">Simple because the ground has been so thoroughly covered by numerous decisions of this Court handed down throughout the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.003" offset="9472000">As I view this case, it seems to me that the Petitioner must establish two propositions and that if he fails on either of these, his -- failure to establish it, it would be fatal to his cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.807" offset="9543158">I haven't quite understood his argument nor his ramifications because on the one hand, he seems to rely upon the Fifth Amendment completely and then he says that he knows it is not applicable to the States and realizes that it is not, but I have heard no mention of his reliance on the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.645" offset="9618495">But as I say, as I view this case, he must establish these two propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.282" offset="9641064">First of all, with the New York State immunity provision with which we're dealing here and its operation in this case, has violated his privilege against self-incrimination as that privilege principle is understood and construed under the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.975" offset="9715879">In other words, were this a federal case rather than a state case and where we're dealing here with a federal immunity statute instead of a state immunity statute, the contention would have to be the first contention of the petitioner that the Fifth Amendment was violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.111" offset="9792366">But since the Fifth Amendment is not applicable to or controlling upon the States, the petitioner must -- go much farther than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.330" offset="9825280">That is only his first step.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.699" offset="9838759">He's relegated it seems to me, to the Fourteenth Amendment and possibly to the Privilege and Immunities Clause that are more likely to the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.320" offset="9893198">In other words, he must establish not only that this would have been a violation of the Fifth Amendment, the privilege provision, if this were a federal case, but that, it's such a heinous and such a shocking violation, one that runs splash against -- up against all our concepts of American justice and liberty, that it is a violation of the Due Process Clause also.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.959" offset="10007824">Now, on that first step which he, if I'm correct, must take and must successfully take, I do not believe that he can succeed in establishing any violation of the privilege against self-incrimination within the meaning of the decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.083" offset="10096327">Examining these immunity provisions, it should be remembered that a state in return for the withdrawal of the privilege and compelling a witness to appear and testify, grants all the protection and immunity that it possibly can.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.197" offset="10172709">It has in mind the admonition of Counselman against Hitchcock where the immunity granted must be as broad as the privilege destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.220" offset="10212833">And by all of the immunity and protection that it can, we mean necessarily, immunity from prosecution within the borders and jurisdiction of a state itself because as the Court well know as I'm sure, no state can grant protection beyond that either on another state or in the federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.150" offset="10312516">We cannot control the procedure and the rules of evidence in the federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.218" offset="10344803">Now, as the Court is also well aware, I'm sure, the situation is somewhat different in the federal courts, that is, in connection with federal immunity and the federal jurisdiction with respect to federal immunity provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.498" offset="10413976">Because of the Federal Supremacy Clause, the Congress may enact federal immunity provisions which extend protection not only within the federal courts themselves that has immunity and protection from criminal prosecution in the federal courts, but also protection from the use of such evidence in any criminal prosecutions which might result in a state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.868" offset="10519406">So, there is a difference there only to the Federal Supremacy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.165" offset="10536647">Now, these federal decisions are interesting here not because they hit our factual situation right on the nose, but because they bring squarely into play the Fifth Amendment to the federal constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.919" offset="10595579">Remembering that, that is not applicable here, if we can examine the situation more minutely by first observing these federal decisions dealing with federal immunity provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.582" offset="10646256">And of course, I refer to Brown against Walker and Hale against Henkel in the main.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.846" offset="10671334">I don't think the Brown case has been accurately presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.932" offset="10691709">I don't think that the issue decided or the declarations of that case so far as they're pertinent here have been accurately -- accurately stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.088" offset="10736327">And both the Brown case and Hale against Henkel, it was claimed that the federal immunity provision in question was inadequate because it did not extend protection to the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.774" offset="10811037">In Brown against Walker, this Court said that that was not so that the particular statute there did extend the protection to the States beyond the federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.850" offset="10863386">But that is not the important aspect of that face of the case, in both Brown against Walker and Hale against Henkel, the Court said this but assuming that that's not so, and assuming that the immunity is just as limited as claimed by the assailant of the statute in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.863" offset="10939350">Assumed it's confined with the federal jurisdiction, still, we find no unconstitutionality in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.816" offset="10971220">We -- we find no violation of the Fifth Amendment.We find no violation of the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.207" offset="11004761">And there as I say, those two cases whether you call it dicta or a plot holding to that effect, it seems to me is not important because of the squarely -- the hold -- the declaration on that point is very direct and square, and those two decisions have been followed on that score during -- by this Court, during many subsequent opinions and decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.130" offset="11124506">The reasoning behind the Brown and Hale cases in that respect is as it's been pointed out, two-fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.089" offset="11160346">First of all, we have what Mr. Fitzpatrick has termed, the dual sovereignty doctrine, and that is merely to the effect that when we view an immunity statute of this nature in view of its operation, we must regard a state and a federal jurisdiction as two separate and distinct sovereignties, that an immunity and protection becomes sufficient under those circumstances -- I see that my time is up.</text>
