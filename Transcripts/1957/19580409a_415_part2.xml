            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.234" offset="24869">(Inaudible) of civil rules does apply in appropriate circumstances to the amendment of a complaint seeking review of an administrative order.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.258" offset="68963">We submit that there was no abuse of discretion on the part of the three-judge court in this case in denying the appellant's motion to amend because again, this was not a routine motion to amend filed at an early stage in the proceedings, rather it came so late that it amounted to a deliberate attempt to split up to what would normally be a single review proceeding, a single day in court into a piecemeal review of an administrative order because the appellant stated candidly to the three-judge court that they would seek to amend their complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.171" offset="248581">If the one question under Section 5, which they had raised in their original complaint, if that question was resolved against them, then they would like to amend to -- to litigate some further questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.072" offset="304274">And raising -- raising the question on amendment that late is essentially the same, we submit, in terms of the wasting of judicial time and the harassment of parties, as if they had actually waited until the three-judge court had rendered its decision and judgment upon the one point raised in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.027" offset="392046">Now, such repetitive review, such piecemeal review of Commission orders, we submit, is repugnant to the whole pattern of arrangements which Congress has provided and indeed which this Court has impart provided for the review of administrative orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.815" offset="463203">Some years ago in the United States v. Griffin, this Court had occasioned to analyze the review provisions provided for the review of Interstate Commerce Commission orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.943" offset="507716">And the Court specifically adverted to the fact that Congress sought to avert the delays incident to litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.907" offset="543556">And in many recent regulatory statutes, almost typically, Congress has specified a period within which proceedings for judicial review of particular types of administrative orders must be brought, such periods are typically 30 or 60 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.471" offset="613878">But this whole pattern of congressional purpose and the purpose of this Court were reasonably expeditious review of orders for a single day in the Court for those that want to challenge regulatory orders is thwarted.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.314" offset="669153">If this new theory of a piecemeal ruling review of orders and the guides of amendments to complaints is accepted, if this -- in many respects, we view this aspect of the case as more important than the subsequent law aspect because in these rate cases in particular, and I emphasize I -- this is no reflection on the parties to this case, I'm just speaking generally, in these rate cases, delay is typically worth a great deal to one side or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.287" offset="809064">Delay is precious to the carrier if it has rate -- if it has rates in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.333" offset="833306">Delay is precious to the protesters if the carrier can't get rate -- can't get rates into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.415" offset="861623">And if, by a theory of amendments to complaints, orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission and other orders of federal regulatory agencies can be subjected to this kind of piecemeal review, then they'll -- then it -- that there will have been created a unique procedure for dilatory tactics.</text>

            <text syncTime="843.109" offset="3372408">I would like to turn now to the issue decided by the -- considered and decided by the court below as to whether this type of transaction is subject to the Commission's jurisdiction under Section 5 of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.814" offset="3455164">Now, the provision, which we think is pertinent and controlling, is that portion of Section 5 (a) (2) which provides that, “It shall be lawful, with the approval of the Commission, for any carrier to acquire control of another through ownership of its stock or by otherwise.”</text>
            <text syncTime="883.123" offset="3532487">Now, here, the Commission exercised jurisdiction over a double transaction but to be consummated simultaneously, transaction by which Golden Gate would acquire certain carrier franchises and properties from Pacific Greyhound, thus making Golden -- Golden Gate a carrier, and at the same time, Pacific would still remain the carrier by reason of -- of the franchises and operations which would continue to operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.377" offset="3653486">Pacific would acquire control of Golden Gate by taking all of its capital stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.210" offset="3676787">In brief, what the Commission did was to determine what was happening, what had happened at the point when the transaction was consummated.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.538" offset="3714090">Now, the appellant's argument briefly is that Section 5 (2) doesn't apply to what they refer to as split-ups of carriers as distinguished from consolidations or unifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.943" offset="3763722">And as a parallel argument, they -- they contend that Section 5 doesn't apply unless using the names of this case, unless Golden Gate was a carrier prior to the beginning of these transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.299" offset="3833104">And they contend that the legislative history shows that Congress was not -- was not concerned to reach with Section 5, split-ups of carrier operation as distinguished from carrier unifications or consolidations.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.874" offset="3895484">Well, now, to begin with, we think that as a matter of literal statutory language, just looking only at the language in a very literal way, this transaction was subject to Section 5 because by the -- by the time the transaction is completed, one carrier has acquired control of another.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.241" offset="3976882">But more importantly, I think from the beginning, this Court has not interpreted Section 5 strictly or in any dictionary sense.</text>

            <text syncTime="1076.032" offset="4304039">And as they are completed, Golden Gate will be in the carrier business, admittedly carrying on carrier operations and it will be controlled by another carrier, Pacific Greyhound.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert W. Ginnane</label>
            <text syncTime="1107.260" offset="4429009">Well, I would answer -- I would answer that in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.158" offset="4440607">First, as this Court has recognized, Section 5 applies to such a variety of transactions, but this Court has never insisted that every transaction covered by Section 5 be spelled out in -- in quite that detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.174" offset="4504660">And secondly, I would like -- I would like to show that the purposes, which Congress intended to be served by this control under Section 5 require that the Commission exercise control over this type of carrier split-up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.244" offset="4580937">Because in a -- in a number of cases under the Transportation Act of 1920, cases dealing with Section 5 and related provisions of the Act such of those of Section 20 (a), concerned with security issues that this Court has given a broad remedial sweep to these provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.268" offset="4677068">Thus, in the Schwabacher case, you summarized your prior decisions as confirming the power and duty of the Interstate Commerce Commission regardless of state law to control rate and capital structures, physical make up and relations between carriers, in the light of the public interest and an efficient -- in an efficient national transportation system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.564" offset="4778214">Now, turning to what we think is the leading case in the interpretation of Section 5, the New York Central Securities Corporation case in 287 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.168" offset="4816666">Now, that case involved Section 5 as it read in the Transportation Act of 1920.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.041" offset="4840072">And at that time, so far as here pertinent, Section 5 then -- then authorized a carrier with the prior approval of the Commission to acquire control of another carrier by lease or by purchase of stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.249" offset="4896914">And in that case, the Commission had authorized a carrier to list the properties of two carriers, which it already controlled through stock ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.543" offset="4930142">And this Court held that the lease, despite the prior stock control, that the lease involved in acquisition of control, which require the Commission's approval under Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.538" offset="4978103">And we think the gist of this Court's decision in that case appears in one short paragraph, which Your Honors quoted last term with approval in the Alleghany case, and I quote briefly, “The public interest is served by economy and efficiency in operation that the expected advantages are inadequately secured by stock ownership and will be better secured by lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.144" offset="5064516">The statute affords no basis for the contention that the latter maybe authorized, although the former exist.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.238" offset="5092937">Then on the Alleghany case, this Court recognized what was not really an issue in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.840" offset="5119269">This Court recognized that approval under Section 5 is required for the merger of a wholly owned carrier corporation and to its carrier parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.902" offset="5163572">But -- and in the Alleghany case, this Court said in determining, the test to determine, the test to apply in determining what transactions are subject to Section 5 is the crux of each inquiry to determine whether there has been an acquisition of control, is the nature of the change in relations between the companies, whose proposed transactions is before the Commission for approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.406" offset="5273600">And the dissenting opinion on that case recognized that Section 5 applies to many intra-system transactions by carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.503" offset="5309962">So, we think the rationale of those two leading decisions under Section 5, both before and after the 1940 amendment, is that if a transaction results in a significant change in the control of relationship between carriers, then it's subject to Section 5.</text>

            <text syncTime="1730.972" offset="6923807">Now, what the Commission did here in substance was to authorize Pacific Greyhound to segregate into separate corporate carrier entities, its short-haul commuter operations on the one hand, and at long haul, intercity operations on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.004" offset="6987964">And on the series of prior decisions beginning in 1940, the Commission has done exactly that same sort of thing to authorize carriers, to segregate substantially different types of carrier operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.469" offset="7045851">Now, they are summarized in our brief at pages 15 and 20, but I can just pinpoint each of them now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.707" offset="7070824">In the Columbia Motor Service case, there was involved a separation of contract carrier from common carrier operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.946" offset="7099768">In Consolidated Freightways, it was a separation of the transportation of automobiles with special equipment from the transportation of general commodities in the -- in the ordinary equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.486" offset="7141878">The Takin case involves the segregation of interstate transportation of general commodities from intrastate transportation of household goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.269" offset="7176986">And the Gehlhaus case involved a segregation of motor carrier operations from water carrier operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.396" offset="7201541">And all those cases, the Commission recognized that the different management and operating problems of the distinctly different types of transportation warranted their segregation into separate operations -- into separate corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.865" offset="7267370">At the same time, the Commission feels and I submit that such a division of a carrier's operations and no matter how useful, no matter how helpful it may be in terms of more efficient transportation, there's something that cannot be done without control, without regulation because the resulting division of assets, how that's done is crucial to the ability of each of the -- of the succeeding corporations to -- to serve the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.385" offset="7385443">It relates to -- well, it can affect their credit standing and other matters with which Congress intended the Commission to concern itself in exercising its powers under Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.164" offset="7436643">So we think that what the Commission did in this case and the type of thing the Commission did here in authorizing a division of carrier operations, as it did on these other -- in these prior cases is consistent, not only with the letter of Section 5 to which we don't attach so much weight but to the broad purposes of Section 5, which this Court has recognized again and again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.010" offset="7548029">In brief, that it's in the interest of economic transportation that carriers would be able to do this depending upon the circumstances to -- to divide clearly different types of transportation operations in a -- in a separate corporate entities.</text>

            <text syncTime="2060.819" offset="8243200">Those decisions of those two Courts of Appeals at least stand for the proposition that in determining whether for the purpose of such statutory provisions, one carrier has acquired control of another carrier.</text>

            <text syncTime="2274.965" offset="9099807">The time remaining is quite brief and yet I do wish to say a few things on both of the two issues which are before the Court at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.482" offset="9145887">I must be brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.338" offset="9149336">I realized that perhaps it can be little more than a summary but first dealing with this jurisdictional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.317" offset="9181205">May I say that I think I would respond to the question posed by the Chief Justice and other Justices as to what particular language of the section is that upon which we rely to validate this particular transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.879" offset="9255497">I would refer it by Section 5 (11), a text appearing upon page 5 -- 15 rather of our brief for the appellees, Golden Gate Transit Lines, et al, and now, I just briefly read, “The authority conferred by this section shall be exclusive and plenary, and any carrier or corporation participating in or resulting from any transaction approved by the Commission thereunder, shall have full power," and so forth.</text>

            <text syncTime="2347.431" offset="9389662">No, but I think it defined just what is in Section 5 and it does apply to resulting (Inaudible) and I have had no doubt and I examined the provision of the statute time and time again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.545" offset="9434175">And it seems to me that Congress was at particular pains to button up and complete this jurisdiction to the Commission, so that there'll be no means to escape from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.581" offset="9478269">And we venture to say upon our brief here that we can't conceive any language as a more comprehensive and get so specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.491" offset="9509930">Now, clearly, we do have a carrier which will result from the transaction which the Commission has approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.227" offset="9536888">I think that's right within the expressed terms of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.646" offset="9550576">Now, we carry forward just a bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.404" offset="9561548">This is an intra-system transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.010" offset="9579938">These are words frequently used by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.257" offset="9592999">The -- it is not to the course that these provisions of the statute deal only with mergers and consolidations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.609" offset="9634377">Granting of that was the main objective, objective as of the legislation as it has been developed here thus far.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.559" offset="9670217">The statute does not restricted to that but covers all manual acquisitions and specifically some purely intra-system transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.931" offset="9715670">Now, the transaction, which was authorized by the Commission and approved by this Court in the New York Central Securities case, was nothing but an intra-system transaction and is observed by -- in the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Douglas in the Alleghany case, in commenting upon the decision in the New York Security -- Central Securities case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.407" offset="9797590">It is said that Section 5 (2) (a) requires many, many intra-system transactions to be subject to the approval of the Commission and that was too here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.627" offset="9842416">Now, Mr. Ginnane has referred to the language used by this Court in the Schwabacher case, which we think is very significant because we have there set forth in a single sentence what I may call the basic philosophy of these provisions alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.781" offset="9919112">And I briefly read that one sentence again, “The tenure of all of this was to confirm the power and duty of the Interstate Commerce Commission, regardless of state law to control rate and capital structures, physical makeup and relation to tin carriers in the light of the public interest in an efficient national transportation system.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.281" offset="10017123">Neither can be no doubt that this immediate program which the Commission approved in our case, this transaction is within the precise times, as I read it, of this declaration of basic policy in the opinion of this Court in the Schwabacher case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.171" offset="10092669">I could continue beyond it but I think that's all that I need.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.808" offset="10107193">I -- I want to act to this great equation as to the possible consequences of a ruling here that this transaction is enough to the jurisdiction of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.288" offset="10153064">There would be a very unfortunate jurisdictional void of these particular carriers, the Greyhound, if you please, or a real carrier could form a subsidiary corporation to be controlled by it and transfer to that carrier such properties as it might desire and could transfer to it stock in other corporations, thus seeking the approval of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.115" offset="10276362">Now, the Commission has brought that out in its brief here and said so in several decisions, there'll be a void if a transaction to this immediate character were not subject to the Commission's control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.192" offset="10328712">Now, there's much more that I would like to say on that jurisdictional question but I think I have enough time, but I do want to answer an inquiry that came from Mr. Justice Brennan, I believe, as to the findings of the Commission as to how the carriers would function under this transaction as authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.563" offset="10410214">The opinion of the Commission is here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.262" offset="10417006">Of course, the record before the Commission is not here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.207" offset="10428813">It was not before the lower court as has been stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.104" offset="10440411">I am not free to discuss anything in that record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.031" offset="10452114">Those issues, many of them and not before this Court now, but we asked the Court in particular to review what the Commission says upon pages 17 to 18 of -- no, we passed that, pardon me, and I correct that, upon pages 27 to 28 in particular of its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.324" offset="10545215">There starting with the -- well, I say the paragraph at the middle of that page 27, where the Commission addresses itself to the public interest in the national transportation policy and then where the paragraph commencing toward the bottom of that page, it deals with the whole problem which was here before the Commission in dealing with these local operations and briefly points out, and I'll just mentioned this, briefly refers in the third line of that last paragraph to the impractical retention in a single entity of how the similar operation it is on, then it deals with the services which will be left.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.409" offset="10697561">All of this will be subdivided on page 28 then further on page -- I'll just briefly refer to this, 31.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.749" offset="10730893">It makes these findings as to consistency to the public convenience and necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.052" offset="10752104">I can't comment beyond that and I again will point out, there's just one issue here we're dealing with in this branch of the case and that is the issue of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.617" offset="10786377">It was jurisdiction in the Commission to authorize this transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.800" offset="10803200">We submit that it was and that it be ghastly against the public interest if that jurisdiction we held not to exist there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.611" offset="10834442">Now, just a few words about the effort to amend this complaint, there would be no much understanding as to the circumstances there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.336" offset="10865267">We have not contend it and I'm not quite sure Mr. Ginnane has not given the Court the impression that under all conditions, a complaint attacking an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission and seeking its annulment should not be subject to amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.793" offset="10931096">In proper case, there might be, but the Congress has made it very clear and this is spelled out so carefully in the opinion of Mr. Justice Brandeis for the anonymous court in the Griffin case in 303 United States that I'm sure are not to be overlooked.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.911" offset="11007582">It gives us the history of these rules for expedited procedure in dealing with complaints brought to in all orders, the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.179" offset="11048647">It points out that they originated in 1903 with statutes to enforce the Antitrust Act or opposing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.649" offset="11086576">And then in 1906 by the Hepburn Act, they were extended of the Interstate Commerce Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.839" offset="11107265">Then in 1910, when the Commerce Court is created, they were continued in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.615" offset="11130358">Some 20 years later when the Commerce Court was abolished, they were still continue to effect under the terms of the Urgent Deficiencies Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.528" offset="11158047">And Mr. Justice Brandeis -- Brandeis makes it exceedingly here, so clear that surely we ought not to disregard them at all, and I'm quoting in, referring to these expedited procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.515" offset="11206008">He says, “These expedited procedures in suits by the United States -- pardon me just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.095" offset="11232340">“These extradited procedures -- pardon me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.616" offset="11246446">I'm trying to go along too hasty I guess.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.107" offset="11256372">The Court says and this is quoted upon page 41 of the Commission's brief here that -- and I'm quoting, “Upon both the trial court and the Supreme Court rest the obligation to give the case precedence over others.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.459" offset="11305796">And he says further and I again quote it, “In such cases, Congress sought to guard against ill-conceited action by a single judge and to avert delays ordinarily instant litigation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.321" offset="11353234">So that Congress in this type of case has particularly undertook to guard against the very sorted length that our adversaries thought to impose upon us in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.349" offset="11393358">Now, just a few words about the chronology of this case if my time is not expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.328" offset="11413211">That chronology has some importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.383" offset="11425437">The Court will bear in mind that the order of the Commission was entered on July 6, 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.098" offset="11448320">It was already nearly three years old incidentally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.983" offset="11459918">On October 18, 1955, the complaint to annul the order was filed in the District Court in San Francisco.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.368" offset="11485414">On February 17, 1956, appellant's motion for the judgment on the pleadings was filed, following motion for judgment in pleadings by the Government and motion to dismiss on our part.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.829" offset="11535256">Now, on February 28, 1956, where the appellant's motion relieved to amend the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.330" offset="11565244">That is only 11 days after he had pleaded for judgment on the pleadings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.477" offset="11581858">Now, let's turn to the transcript just a moment, if we have that much time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.879" offset="11603487">Page 17, we have -- I think it's page 17, the appellant's motion for leave to -- pardon me, motion for judgment on the pleadings filed February 17, 1956, commencing at the fifth line at the bottom.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.960" offset="11675794">It is alleged, there is no question of fact involved in the case and the sole question presented is one of law, which should be determined in favor of the prejudice.</text>

            <text syncTime="3018.591" offset="12074318">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.530" offset="12078080">I'd like to refer once again to the circumstances under which the amendment to the complaint was offered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.161" offset="12112562">In the Interstate Commerce Commission report at page 21 of the record, there is this statement regarding one of the public interest reasons which impelled the Commission to authorize this transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.094" offset="12176300">Part of the overall management problem is that of labor management relations, which, although strongly disputed by the union, applicants contend with benefit from the proposed separation of the operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.315" offset="12233247">The negotiation of employment contracts with the union in the past has been made especially difficult because the terms applicable to the two classes of drivers have been embraced in a single labor agreement even though the operating practices have been different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.572" offset="12306286">And then the report goes on to point to a strike situation which resulted because of conditions peculiar to one group but involving the entire system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.339" offset="12349336">Now, in the phase of that finding, Greyhound and Golden Gate on February 21, 1956 negotiated an agreement with the labor unions who, up to that point, were joint parties plaintiff with us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.918" offset="12415582">And that agreement provided that if this transaction went through, the employees of Golden Gate and Greyhound would be covered by a single labor agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.247" offset="12480888">Now, it was this strange circumstance on February 21, announced to the Court on February 23, that led the appellants immediately to reevaluate the question as to whether or not the public interest findings of the Commission should be challenged and appellants immediately made oral request for a permission to amend.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.113" offset="12584438">And as Mr. Matthew has just stated, the Court gave permission to file a written motion with the proposed amendment in writing and that was done five days later, a weekend having intervened.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.365" offset="12649430">Those were the circumstances that led to the motion to amend.</text>

            <text syncTime="3225.369" offset="12901460">A -- a challenge to the public interest findings of the Interstate Commerce Commission raises a question which, from the appellant's point of view, is a very difficult one because the Court must be persuaded that there is no substantial basis in the record, none of the grounds set forth in -- in the Commission's findings are substantial and supported by the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.693" offset="13002710">And if there is one substantial factor which would support the Commission's order, a challenge based on the -- on the adequacy of the findings will not succeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.335" offset="13053283">And very frankly, the one factor which troubled me when I initially made the judgment decision not to challenge the findings was this question of the Interstate Commerce Commission's conclusion which recited a strike that the public interest would be served by having separate labor agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.492" offset="13137920">Now, this was rather dramatically exposed to me as a sham presentation which Greyhound and Golden Gate had made to the Interstate Commerce Commission and had successfully sold to the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="3485.075" offset="13940297">The reason for the denial was that the applicable criteria were inadvertence mistake, excusable neglect and so on, the criteria for a relief from a default judgment rather than the standards which Rule 15 (a) requires.</text>

            <text syncTime="3550.730" offset="14202880">The plaintiff then asked in the appellate court for leave to amend and was refused and this Court remanded that case back to the Court of Appeals to permit the amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3584.736" offset="14338926">This is not a situation where operating rights or carrier properties belonging to one carrier entity are being transferred to another carrier entity.</text>

            <text syncTime="3623.150" offset="14492526">This is not even that kind of a case.</text>
