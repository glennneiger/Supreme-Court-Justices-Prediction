            <text syncTime="7.234" offset="28839">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.213" offset="36780">The question presented here is whether petitioner was properly sentenced to three consecutive prison terms for a single sale of narcotics simultaneously violating three anti-narcotics statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.636" offset="90488">The court below reluctantly followed this Court's decision in Blockburger and said that this could be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.172" offset="120686">The facts are uncomplicated and I believe undisputed, indictments in six counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.837" offset="147331">The first three cover one sale and the second three, cover a sale two days later.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.445" offset="173767">The first three counts are, count one is that he sold without the required written order that violates one statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.641" offset="218488">Second count is he sold the same narcotics without a tax stamp that violates a different statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.690" offset="246700">The third is he sold it knowing it has been unlawfully imported, a third completely different statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.855" offset="279406">The second three counts has four, five and six, are the same statutory violation of the second sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.379" offset="325486">The trial was like every other narcotics trial, I take it, like the ones that Massey Alley and Sherman decided this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.652" offset="350563">It was simply the testimony of the narcotics agent who had induced the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.066" offset="368222">We make no claim of entrapment because we were not -- we know nothing about the situation but we do know that the entrapment point was raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.812" offset="399151">But the testimony was roughly the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.669" offset="406674">The agent comes in and testifies.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.377" offset="413466">He went to the man.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.733" offset="418900">He asked if he could buy some narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.090" offset="428304">The man goes out for an hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.424" offset="433633">He comes back, hands him the narcotics, takes the Government agent's money and that's all we know about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.546" offset="458083">We do know that it was simply this one act all within an hour of going out and getting the narcotics and handing it over that allegedly violates three statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.368" offset="505417">Now, the sentence which Judge Youngdahl gave was this, one to five years on the first count for selling without a written order, one to five years consecutive on the second count of selling without tax stamps and one to five years on the third count of selling knowing of the unlawful importation, a total of 3 to 15 years for the first sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.833" offset="627252">For the second sale, he gave him a concurrent sentence, so that what we really -- what we have before the Court is the consecutive sentences of one to five, one to five and one to five for the one sale for the three statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.964" offset="711784">In other words, we do not have to concern ourselves with the second sale because that was all concurrent.</text>

            <text syncTime="196.961" offset="787749">The minimum in the District of Columbia is one-third of the maximum under the Indeterminate Sentence Act, so it would have been 20 months, would have been most of the minimum could have been and we have 3 to 15 instead of what would have been maximum 20 to 5 -- five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.182" offset="852637">Now, there was no appeal but the -- under 28 U.S.C. 2255, petitioner sought relief from an excessive sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.703" offset="886805">The District Court found he was not entitled to relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.215" offset="896836">The Court of Appeals affirmed by Judge Bazelon and Judge Faye both expressed their displeasure or reluctance to follow Blockburger, although they of course did follow it.</text>

            <text syncTime="264.430" offset="1057646">But if, Your Honor please, the Boggs Act of 1951 makes a first offender a maximum sentence and a second offender, it would be my contention if I were here with that case which I am not but the Boggs Act prevents that because he wasn't a person who had been previously convicted under the Boggs Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="305.649" offset="1222531">First, we maintain that Congress did not intend to make the simultaneous violation of three anti-narcotics statutes by a single sale of narcotics into three separate sentences for the purpose of conviction and sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.655" offset="1282612">We do say of course that Congress intended to make them separate offenses, that they could be prosecuted under either that the Government doesn't have to make a selection until sometime but that they cannot have consecutive sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.559" offset="1334230">And secondly, we contend that if Congress did so intend its action as applied to this case, violates the Double Jeopardy Clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="467.863" offset="1871412">And the multiple statutory offense cases where several statutes are involved, where this Court has taken a 180-degree diametrically opposed rule and said there that automatically if there is different evidence or a different element then Congress is presumed to have wanted the more severe result.</text>

            <text syncTime="661.296" offset="2645159">And we made the same mistake of assuming this last one was part of the Harrison Act because the Court in Blockburger had actually made the same implication.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.676" offset="2686642">Actually, the three statutes do come from different -- at the -- into the law at different time.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.280" offset="2717048">But we suggest to Your Honor that there is -- Honors -- that there is no question that they were all intended for a single purpose, the suppression of nonmedicinal use of narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.296" offset="2765113">That there was no other conceivable purpose for these three statutes and it is of no significance when they came in since each one of them makes clear that this was their purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.057" offset="2820180">And I particularly would like the Court to note on pages 26 and 27 of our brief, probably the best statement of congressional purpose in the entire legislative history, although this is only a very small part of it is the House Report on the 1914 statute which was the basic statute in which the House stated as its purpose, narcotic should be confined to legitimate medic -- medical channel and it has been decided by them that only by justice -- that only by custom laws and by the exertion of the federal taxing power can be desired and be accomplished.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.011" offset="2991961">These are the italicized parts there and this is the thread of the entire legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.246" offset="3016934">It is that all power taxing customs interstate commerce must be used to suppress the nonmedicinal use of narcotic.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.068" offset="3056222">Now, the Government concedes all these, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.698" offset="3066776">I don't want to understate this but it is my belief that from the Government's brief, they concede that all -- these statutes were aimed at outlawing sales of narcotics except through recognized medical channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.957" offset="3119752">On page 14 of the Government's brief, it states that these statutes were aimed in outlawing sales of narcotics except through recognized channels.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.390" offset="3161548">And on page 17 in the title, the Government says the three narcotics provisions have distinct function in the enforcement of the ultimate and of suppressing narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.767" offset="3207001">So it does seem to me that there is no question of the unitary purpose of Congress here.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.688" offset="3230720">Now, as far as the opposed -- this was the situation when we had Blockburger.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.466" offset="3253812">This was not argued to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.997" offset="3259977">The legislative history, the unitary purpose, the suppressed narcotics was not explained to the Court and the decision went the other -- went the way opposite of our contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.701" offset="3306789">And we believe that that would be enough now for reconsideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.634" offset="3326433">Nevertheless, the post-Blockburger statutes do throw some light on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.230" offset="3344823">There have been three, the 1937 Act, the 1951 Boggs Act and the 1956 Act which involves -- which is post the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.588" offset="3390276">Therefore, I thought I would refer solely to the Boggs Act which was the statute in effect at the time of the act, the trial, and the sentencing.</text>

            <text syncTime="893.957" offset="3575745">Now, everything in the Boggs Act, it seems to us, points towards a congressional intention against consecutive sentences here.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.497" offset="3617959">In the first place, the Boggs Act sought uniformity, stated that's perfectly clearly an intention.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.566" offset="3646171">Well, how can one be uniformed in punishment if the prosecutor can determine how many crimes you've committed and can use in one case, one count and in another case two counts and in another case, three counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.402" offset="3705522">This gives prosecutorial discretion in determining crime and punishment, and judicial discretion rather than the uniformity sought by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.050" offset="3752124">And secondly, there was a -- Congress try to have a similarity of treatment for repeaters.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.540" offset="3778142">They didn't care about the -- they gave the same sentence both when they were -- for what they were -- regardless of what the repeater did and regardless of what the repeater had done before.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.826" offset="3823282">They treated them -- they showed that the whole thing was aimed at the suppression and not the particular method in which the criminal or alleged criminal happened to violate the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.747" offset="3874900">And thirdly, they provided for differentiation.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.876" offset="3887438">They believed in the principle of reform.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.682" offset="3898723">And the first sentence, the first offense was not intended to carry as -- as severe a sentence as the second or third.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.585" offset="3934250">Well, if by multiplying the punishment at the first offense, you can get and we did here, yet, a penalty greater than there was -- could have legally been for a second offense under the Boggs Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.332" offset="3993287">In other words, the maximum of 15 years which was given here is five years longer than the Boggs Act permits for a second offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="1410.377" offset="5641404">Now, the Court didn't have the legislative history before it at that time and it may -- well if I may say so, a mistake that it sometimes occurs, it applied a test that have been set up as constitutional test as a matter of statutory construction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1432.768" offset="5731056">If you will look at Blockburger, you will see that what were cited are the Murray case from Massachusetts and the Gavieres case, both of which dealt with the double jeopardy question and said that the rule for double jeopardy is whether there's a different element or different evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.655" offset="5802527">And then without any discussion, Blockburger applies that rule as though it was related to the intent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.052" offset="5836173">Well, there is no possible reason for assuming that Congress in deciding severity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.335" offset="5865326">In deciding how much to punish someone should have thought that a good rule would be a rule that have been set up for constitutional purposes and I -- it just seems to me as clear as night and day that this just wasn't -- just wasn't thought of at the time, that double jeopardy had not been raised in Blockburger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.724" offset="5954873">But that the Court really without very much discussion just applies cases that involved the double -- the different element or different evidence test that comes from the constitutional discussion in the Massachusetts case and then in this Court's decision in Gavieres, it pulls that over that constitutional test as though it had something to do with the intent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.081" offset="6044317">Without ever considering, whether this would have been a logical intent of Congress and without one word in the legislative history ever suggesting that Congress was thinking in the terms of a different evidence or different element test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.745" offset="6098965">And we say that the use of the different element or different evidence test for statutory construction is -- is putting one's hand -- hand in the standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.201" offset="6148702">No -- Congress has never suggested that test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.216" offset="6160823">This Court just assumed Congress meant that and we suggest the abandonment of this test.</text>

            <text syncTime="1610.708" offset="6442736">There's no reason to believe that Congress utilized the different element or different evidence test when it came to the multiple statute case but it wasn't prepared to utilize that when it came to the unit of prosecution cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="2060.906" offset="8243618">As again saying that when it passed an act in 1909 to throttle or at least to curve the narcotic statute, that's the purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="2241.851" offset="8967314">Nevertheless, we do feel to call on to go into the constitutional point very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.259" offset="8993019">Now, there's a preliminary question which we thought might be argued by the Government, whether multiple punishment at one trial could ever be double jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.742" offset="9030949">The Government at page 38 of its brief concedes that it can be in Footnote 18 on page 38.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.508" offset="9061982">The Government concedes the preliminary question which we briefed but I do not feel to call upon to argue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.253" offset="9088940">It states -- the Government states, we do not dispute petitioner's position, that multiple punishment for the same offense after a single trial would be a violation of double jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.481" offset="9133871">Now, the question is was this the same offense?</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.057" offset="9148186">Now, the Constitution provides that no person shall be subject for the same offense, to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.376" offset="9181414">I would respectfully submit that the primary meaning would appear to mean in same offense would be same offense and that it would be same act, or same conduct, or same transaction not possibly too late for such a meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.823" offset="9247242">I think when you come, you try to -- to this Court, you try to -- to absorb as much of -- of history as you can and it is probably too late to go back to the primary -- what would have seemed to us, the primary meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.566" offset="9314220">It is not, however, too late to go -- to make same offense, one offending of society, one social evil.But in other words, if the same transaction creates only one social evil, then it would seem to us that there should be a violation -- that should be treated as a violation of the double jeopardy provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.195" offset="9436682">Now, there's nothing in Hoag or Ciucci this morning, which in anyway revalidates the earlier decision or it challenges the point we are now making.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.513" offset="9489972">In the first place those were state cases and I take it that the majority view remain, the double jeopardy is not within the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.882" offset="9527484">In the second place, it's very likely that even if this Court adopted what we urge, which is that where there is one transaction then it would be a violation of double jeopardy, unless that single transaction created two social evils.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.327" offset="9605224">You might still say that the murder of two people was two social evils or the robbery of two people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.119" offset="9636467">In fact, we had foreseen this problem and at page 71 of our brief in a footnote we had rather assumed that these cases would -- might go that way and had distinguished the problem in our Footnote 51 at page 71.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.334" offset="9713267">Now, the different evidence test, I've pointed out as meaningless for purposes of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.464" offset="9741793">It doesn't work as a constitutional test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.467" offset="9757780">It got into the law, I might say by accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.847" offset="9779304">It was borrowed from Murray against Commonwealth in 1871 in Massachusetts where Mr. Murray was indicted for relations with one Bridget Kennedy and he was indicted for both adultery and lewd cohabitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.743" offset="9862896">The Massachusetts court put the no double jeopardy on the ground that there was a different element in each case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.474" offset="9893825">I would respectfully suggest that had they put it on the ground that there was a different social evil in each case, namely the one, the protection of the interest of the State in protecting the State as a matrimony, the other in the public morals you would have had a different development of the law of double jeopardy in America.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.314" offset="9973238">But this Court borrowed this different element as -- just took this different element or different evidence test as a basis of constitutional decision from the Murray case in the Gavieres case without any consideration of the fact that the Murray case itself was explicable on other grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.891" offset="10051500">And the point is -- and even argued in Blockburger -- in Blockburger and many other cases, it is just assumed that the different evidence or different element test works.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.434" offset="10089639">Now, the -- I can't see the different element test at all as a constitutional test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.088" offset="10120255">The -- the Government's whole point is that you don't look at what the facts that the individual did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.461" offset="10145750">You look at whether there are different statutes involved and different evidence under the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.541" offset="10170096">But I respectfully suggest that the Bill of Rights looks at what the individual does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.573" offset="10190263">But the -- that the difference between us and the Government is not great, it's just the fact that we're on different sides of the room looking at the -- at the same point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.795" offset="10223177">We say that under the Bill of Rights, you don't look at what Congress did to see its three statutes here for constitutional purposes, you look at how they affect the individual and the individual was engaged in only one transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.950" offset="10275736">And if he only offended one social purpose or one social interest by that, it does not -- not seem to -- to us that this would warrant saying, why you can get him as many times as you want as long as he happens to have -- by his single act have done -- have gone against three different statutes, even though he didn't do -- even though nothing in there was against a different social evil.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.469" offset="10397780">That was the one evil here at the suppression of narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.246" offset="10408960">It's the one sale that's involved.And it seems to us that a time has come for a reconsideration of the basic constitutional test if this Court reaches it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.597" offset="10450338">We of course presenting with full vigor that this problem should not be reached here because the statutory problem of reconciling the two lines of cases would help us a great deal more.</text>

            <text syncTime="2900.805" offset="11603174">Well, it does appear to me that it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.284" offset="11613100">I would -- I'd go farther, if Your Honor please.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.448" offset="11621773">I think that when the Constitution says the same offense, it means the same offense and one act means one offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.309" offset="11641208">But I think it maybe too late to -- and I feel somewhat obligated not to propose so radical a shift with the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.053" offset="11676212">Therefore, we are suggesting a more limited test which is the very test which was suggested by Mr. Kirchheim (ph) in the article cited in your -- in your opinion this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.271" offset="11712993">Now, in conclusion I would just like to state five reasons why we feel that Blockburger should be reversed on the statutory ground or the constitutional ground, but I think that I've made our position clear in favor of the statutory ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.562" offset="11786240">First, there is no enforcement problem, the Government conceives that there's no enforcement problem in this -- about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.313" offset="11813198">Their argument is on the contrary there's not much -- it doesn't do much damage, the judge can always take care of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.393" offset="11837544">Their argument is this as a minimal problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.726" offset="11846844">Leave it all alone because it's worked all right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.446" offset="11857711">But the Government conceived that this will not create an enforcement problem for you.Secondly, it will reconcile the two lines of cases which seems to me the day to be creating the conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.042" offset="11896163">Thirdly, there is a dissatisfaction among the lower court judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.156" offset="11912568">There are four -- there are four Circuit Courts of Appeal which -- which have expressed their dissatisfaction of Blockburger, the court below here, the Second Circuit, the Eighth Circuit and the Yancy Sixth Circuit case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.712" offset="11966798">And it seems to me the time -- further more and fourthly the -- the grave injustice to leave this to prosecutor and judge the danger of disparity, the danger of high sentences more than in one Circuit, one -- one District more than another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.726" offset="12038896">And finally, I think it should be said that Congress has sought to develop uniformity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.933" offset="12059690">That's what I think the meaning of the Boggs Act as one of uniformity and we urge a reversal in the interest both of uniformity (Inaudible).</text>

            <text syncTime="3029.518" offset="12117995">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.378" offset="12129489">Blockburger was decided in 1932 and it was not a unique case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.794" offset="12163135">It's followed by a number of decisions from this field before and number of decisions after.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.934" offset="12191660">And they all seem to me quite consistent in the point of view which I don't think has been changed by the more recent decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.615" offset="12238367">As the -- I don't think the particular factor that I think is the keystone to all these decisions, doesn't seem to me to have been affected by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.384" offset="12277447">And what I think that is, is this, what the Court said in Blockburger what it said in Albrecht, which Blockburger started was that when we're discussing the intent of Congress in creating offenses, the question is what was the congressional purpose?</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.812" offset="12375144">What was Congress trying to accomplish when it outlawed certain behavior?</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.117" offset="12404402">And in judging the congressional intent, we start with the way Congress legislates in general, not for Joe Doe and not for any particular set of facts that might happen to occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.320" offset="12461244">But what was the particular that Congress prohibited?</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.857" offset="12495412">And if Congress intended to punish two different things in the Blockburger case, selling without a written order form and in the other offense selling without the stamps right on the narcotics, so you can tell whether they are legitimate or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.807" offset="12583184">If Congress said doing each one of these things is the fair thing that we think should be punished and if these two things can be different, then as far as Congress is concerned they're subject to two separate punishments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.085" offset="12664268">And I think that if you go through all the decisions of the Court, you'll see that that is the keystone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.615" offset="12694361">It's true that more recently the intent of Congress has been interpreted perhaps a little more broadly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.226" offset="12728842">But it's always been what was the act that Congress punished and not what was in the mind of the defendant when he did those things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.676" offset="12774609">If Congress said, you shouldn't do two things then the punishment placed can be for the two things that Congress meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.429" offset="12813688">Let me at this moment say that I think we don't gain much in this case by talking about double jeopardy because it seems to me at least double jeopardy in the context of retrial, because the problems are different as this Court's opinion in Hoag states although generally, the Court has not bothered to make that distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.069" offset="12920268">There is no doubt, it seems to me, there is absolutely no constitutional problem that if Congress had said, you shall not sell unlawfully imported narcotics, if you do so, you'll be subject to apply the penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.459" offset="12981812">If in that sale you also leave out order forms, there shall be five-year additional penalty and if in that sale you don't put in stamps, there will be an additional five-year penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.265" offset="13033012">They had done that at one time in absolutely unmistakable language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.716" offset="13062792">There wouldn't be any constitutional question whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.105" offset="13084317">On the other hand, I think if they had done it exactly that way, if a man was either convicted or acquitted of that one sale, there wouldn't be any doubt that you couldn't reach wrong and there is because it would be the same offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.957" offset="13147742">So that I think what the purpose of this case where all we're dealing with is punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.096" offset="13172297">It's fair to concern ourselves to the question of how do we decide what it is that Congress has made the subject of punishment and our -- that the approach -- now, what the approach of the Court in Blockburger, in Albrecht, in Burton, later on in Michener was we look at what Congress said you shouldn't do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.744" offset="13294968">Did Congress have a reason for that?</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.344" offset="13305313">If it did, then it doesn't make any difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.066" offset="13320255">Whether in a particular case, under a particular set of facts that was done by one act or two closely related act, the point is you've done two things that Congress said you shouldn't do and therefore you're subject to the punishment for not doing those two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.056" offset="13408131">Now, Blockburger recognize this quite explicitly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.695" offset="13426730">The other decisions I think more implicitly, they don't say so that the particular facts to the particular case in the close relationship of the offenses to each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.328" offset="13473228">A large problem for the sentencing judge or some of them sentencing is a matter which is presently under consideration by Congress, leaves the sub-committee of the Senate Judiciary Committee has mentioned as one of the subjects to think worthy of further study of the matter of disparity in sentencing in the federal court and that is possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.086" offset="13596317">But that is the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.153" offset="13600601">It's a sentencing problem and is not essentially one of the definitions of the offenses or of double jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.264" offset="13641038">And I think perhaps the most vivid illustration of how the matter of approach are, can in effect in a sense effectively so, is that the -- you will compare the opinion of the Eighth Circuit in Michener against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.632" offset="13734452">With the short opinion of this Court, we've reasoned it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.868" offset="13751380">In Michener against the United States this Court, the Eighth Circuit said, what we agreed that possessing a counterfeit plate and causing a counterfeit plate to be made can sometimes be two different offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.357" offset="13849391">But in this particular case the indictment charge possession at exactly the same time, the same place as the charge of the making and the Government conceded that the making and the possession were coextensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.949" offset="13919713">So we think in this case you can't have separate punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.765" offset="13943014">This Court reversed in a very short per curiam citing Gavieres, and Albrecht, and Blockburger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.618" offset="13986377">And it seems to me that if you analyze those cases and what they held, Albrecht was the case under prohibition, where there was one sentence for possession and one sentence for sale of liquor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.084" offset="14048235">No question there that what Congress was aiming was the unitary purpose outlawing illicit sale of liquor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.096" offset="14084284">No question there of justifying on any limited theory of federal jurisdiction, the Federal Government head up to the power drawing prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.215" offset="14136842">The point was Justice Brandeis said in his opinion was possession is something Congress want to prohibit, sale is something Congress want to prohibit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.448" offset="14189714">Possession and sale can in general be different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.788" offset="14211135">The fact that they happen to be together in this case, that doesn't make the offenses the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.026" offset="14244049">It's for the judge to decide whether on a particular fact consecutive sentences are warranted or what -- or they were not, and that I take it is what the Court was saying in Blockburger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.028" offset="14296085">And the considerations that led the Court to that opinion are just as valid today as they were then and are just as supported by the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.838" offset="14351256">Now, Blockburger cites, Nigro and I think it is fair to presume that the Court read its prior decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.342" offset="14389290">If you're looking at the decision in Nigro which is quoted extensively on pages 21 to 22 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.853" offset="14427324">I think you will see that the Court was completely aware of the purpose of the narcotic laws to outlaw illegal sale and that they were well aware of the fact that each was in a sense a step towards outlawing the ultimate evil.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.378" offset="14545502">And if you read Blockburger as against the background of Nigro and as against the background of all the other cases that had been decided before that, Burton and Albrecht.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.687" offset="14602658">There's a per curiam called King against the United States decided just before Blockburger which involved one offense as selling one of -- morphine and another of shipping the same morphine in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.871" offset="14671412">I don't think it can be said that Blockburger was written in any unawareness for the purposes of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.959" offset="14699833">And as a matter of fact, when you look at the statute it's perfectly clear that Congress had very specific things in mind by each of these statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.798" offset="14739122">The first was passed in 1909 and it was originally just an import tax are of -- a prohibition against importation and against dealing in imported products.</text>
            <text syncTime="3699.964" offset="14799830">Well, very soon, Congress found that wasn't sufficient because once the narcotics had come in, it found no way to trace them federally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3712.039" offset="14848104">If they had come and couldn't separate the illegal from the legal narcotics and/or control thereafter importation disappeared unless you actually found them the man -- the man could show that he knew they had been illegally imported.</text>
            <text syncTime="3729.738" offset="14918949">And so in 1914, Congress passed the statute requiring the written order form.</text>
            <text syncTime="3738.461" offset="14953744">Now, this is an extremely important statute in the enforcement of the narcotic laws because that's the one by which legitimate narcotics or trade from their entry into the country, right down through the wholesaler to the jobber, to the retailer, to the pharmacist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3763.085" offset="15052278">As a matter of fact anything peculiar about written order forms will immediately start an investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3771.590" offset="15086341">And so, for example if a druggist or a doctor is suddenly showing up with too many order forms, that's the basis for investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3782.117" offset="15128451">That shows up in the direct sale case of this Court in 319 and was a subject testimony in 1956 by the Commission of Narcotics explaining the importance of the order form in controlling domestic traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3799.856" offset="15199399">But even that didn't prove sufficient because narcotics are sometimes stolen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3806.801" offset="15227193">Narcotics are sometimes obtained illegitimately from doctors and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3812.820" offset="15251226">And secondly, of course the illegitimate trade wasn't paying any taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3819.058" offset="15276199">And so in 1919, Congress held the third provision which asks for a stamp right on the narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3827.941" offset="15311726">Well, there are two purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3829.562" offset="15318204">In the first place, it identified the narcotics immediately without checking on order forms as legitimate or illegitimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3837.988" offset="15351850">And in the second place, it was a way of making clear of getting taxes from the illegitimate business so that to that extent there was a revenue, one indefinite revenue purpose to the measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3854.813" offset="15419246">Now, that's what Blockburger was decided and that's what was really the decision when the Court said that each of the sections of the Harrison Narcotics Act continue a separate crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3869.565" offset="15478178">And as for Congress -- the only thing Congress has shown the least interest in changing about Blockburger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3880.465" offset="15521855">Well, it has not specifically mentioned Blockburger, let me say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3884.288" offset="15537110">But the only thing that Congress had been interested in doing with respect to setting thing in narcotic cases is to make certain that the minimum are heavy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3896.118" offset="15584444">Now, that -- above that the one -- the great subject to discussion in the hearings and on the floor of Congress was that the sentences imposed by federal judges were too low.</text>
            <text syncTime="3915.803" offset="15663125">They had statistics to the effect that the average they intend was 23 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="3923.641" offset="15694472">This -- whether it was the first offender or not and what the real interest in the Boggs Act was doing was to make certain there was a dealer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3933.296" offset="15733133">But this Court had said in Blockburger if what we have decided is too harsh, it's for Congress to change it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3941.603" offset="15766361">There's absolutely no indication that I can say that Congress was interested in changing this doctrine which wasn't confined to Blockburger that each of this offenses were separate or that each prohibition by Congress was a subject to a separate punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3961.577" offset="15846296">As a matter of fact, to the extent that there are any indications of congressional control in the event of Congressional intent in the Boggs Act, it seems to me that they are in a direction of reaffirming Blockburger because the Court separately amended the Export-Import Control Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3979.977" offset="15919856">The Court separately amended the House in Narcotics Act and whereas the Boggs -- the Harrison Act originally had said for any violation of this Act there shall be a punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4005.347" offset="16021316">And there has been an attempt to base an argument for a single punishment on that radiology in Blockburger.</text>
            <text syncTime="4015.819" offset="16063216">The Boggs Act changed that to read for any offense, the punishment shall be minimum and maximum, I think --</text>

            <text syncTime="4030.684" offset="16122671">Well, as I read the Bell and the C.I.T. cases, Your Honor, they are not inconsistent with the philosophy that you look to what it is that Congress hunched and I think that they do show attends the -- to interpret that general intent more broadly.</text>
            <text syncTime="4056.467" offset="16225802">And so, I say that there's a different field for example in Bell and C.I.T. than there is in the Mailbag case where the Court said any mailbag -- any mailbag means if you cut six (Inaudible) offense, I think the stress in Bell is on cutting or destroying.</text>
            <text syncTime="4082.786" offset="16331128">But I don't see that the Bell cases have reached the question of -- if Congress had a general object in mind, I don't read them as adopting for instance anything like a single transaction test.</text>
            <text syncTime="4101.273" offset="16405002">I don't read them as saying we decide what Congress meant by trying to figure out or what would Congress have wanted if it had this particular case before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4114.008" offset="16455993">For instance, these statutes don't mean -- don't all relate necessarily to sale as sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="4125.197" offset="16500715">The one statute involved in this case prohibit the transportation concealment facilitating the transportation and sale of unlawfully imported narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="4144.398" offset="16577515">I don't quite understand Mr. Rauh's argument to this degree, is he going to say that, well, it's one offense, it merges in the sale if -- or you approved to sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="4158.107" offset="16632372">But if we show that he transported it and we think we did in this case, that then becomes one offense or two offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="4168.374" offset="16673437">Secondly, the purchase, the stamp requirement prohibits unstamped narcotics purchased or sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="4181.142" offset="16724532">It isn't sale, it's the unstamped part of it that's just to that effect, and that's different from the unlawful importation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4190.221" offset="16760790">And as I mentioned before, the written order form has -- well, it relates to sale as such has a purpose, that's different from the stamp purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="4202.456" offset="16809796">This is the -- this is the real regulatory purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="4205.937" offset="16823693">You need -- the Government needs those order forms to keep track of what's going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="4213.108" offset="16852428">So that -- well, the more recent cases tend that there are more possible within one statute to interpret the general intent more favorably to a defendant than has been done.</text>
            <text syncTime="4228.880" offset="16915435">I don't read them as going back from this -- well I consider the general approach of all these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4236.116" offset="16944379">That if the general intent of the statute that determines whether it's an offense separate from the other and that you don't look at the fact that in this particular case, it happens to be largely a sale.</text>

            <text syncTime="4475.317" offset="17901192">One thing is that I think that there, under the rule of Bell and C.I.T. and De Novo there might -- it might be possible to interpret a statute as saying of one offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="4493.705" offset="17974753">As I see it here, the trouble is not only the statute came many different times but that it isn't just sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="4501.296" offset="18005159">This one happens to be sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="4504.488" offset="18017907">But there are cases that were mentioned, I think the time of Sherman where somebody said, oh I didn't sell, I was just buying for a friend of mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="4517.228" offset="18068898">And the Court just said that isn't a sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="4520.664" offset="18082586">But they said, well, but that is transporting narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="4524.184" offset="18096692">You aren't allowed to transport them either.</text>
            <text syncTime="4527.495" offset="18109962">And so, the difficulty is that, as I see the statute, they cover sale and it's perfectly true that at least as to heroine in many cases, anybody who does that will almost automatically rallied all three, but not necessarily and that isn't really what Congress was thinking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="4550.850" offset="18203376">Congress was thinking about the fact that it needed all these additional checks on these very small objects, very easily hidden.</text>
            <text syncTime="4560.264" offset="18240993">If one to keep just a (Inaudible) possible, we have this in all sorts of variations and the problem becomes of course often very difficult solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4572.671" offset="18290625">For example, Congress requires everybody to file an income tax return, beyond a certain amount even when the tax isn't due for a particular year.</text>
            <text syncTime="4582.039" offset="18328137">But it's obviously important for Congress to know that everybody is filing returns, so they can check on them even if they're not going to collect money in the particular time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4591.285" offset="18365127">And so, it seems to me that if we keep the Blockburger rule and say, let's look at what Congress have to say -- decided in general and let's leave it to the sentencing judge to take into consideration the facts to this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4615.325" offset="18461257">Now, maybe sometimes judges don't do -- don't look at the facts, they look at the defendant a little bit more.</text>
            <text syncTime="4622.262" offset="18488947">But by and large of course in most instances, this problem is handled at a sentencing level.</text>
            <text syncTime="4631.012" offset="18523951">And this case -- illustrates again on the problems that come up and how they appear.Now, as I see this case, there is a 10-year sentence on any theory here, unless one is to adopt Mr. Rauh's noble suggestion that no matter how many different sales and how many -- over six months possibly, the Boggs Act prohibit more than five years for any one conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4663.501" offset="18653936">I don't think that's true at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4664.988" offset="18659892">The Boggs Act in receipt of its statutes in general say, if that you've once been convicted, you go out and commit an offense again, we're going to make you subject to a greater penalty for the second time you commit the mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="4686.473" offset="18745887">But there's absolutely nothing in that legislative history that would suggest that Congress ever dreamed of the fact that by fixing a minimum for a first offense and then making a higher minimum for a second offense, it's thought that somebody who sold -- made 10 different sales of narcotics, shall I say, within the same class with somebody who made only one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4717.138" offset="18868454">And as a matter of fact as far as the 1956 Act is concerned which came even later, Congress even differentiated between the penalty for some of these offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="4730.135" offset="18920490">The stamp tax carries a lesser penalty and the possibility of probation than do the other two.</text>
            <text syncTime="4737.728" offset="18950896">And as far as the general attitude of Congress is concerned towards multiple offenses in these narcotics field, the 1956 Act has one other possible indication.</text>
            <text syncTime="4750.833" offset="19003246">It's in a different section dealing with the unauthorized use of interstate communications.</text>
            <text syncTime="4758.510" offset="19033966">But Section 1403 of the 1956 Act provides that every separate use of a communication facility shall be a separate offense under that Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="4774.063" offset="19096242">So, I think that it can -- I can find nothing in the later history that shows any intent to overrule Blockburger.</text>
            <text syncTime="4788.162" offset="19152562">On the other hand, there -- it never was explicitly reaffirmed what seems to me is that the whole doctrine of multiple offenses depending on what has been defined by the statute rather than by the particular fact of one sale has been by 1951, so ingrained in federal law and so little question until the later cases that it simply wasn't discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4826.797" offset="19307102">And of course again the problem was not in a sense, the harsh penalties that came from multiple offenses and this was simply a prosecutive caution to avoid various possible defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="4845.106" offset="19380349">Because the difficulty that Congress found with the action of federal judges in this field was that their total sentences, consecutive or otherwise, for what it sought to low and its whole emphasis has been on increasing minimums rather than trying to overcome the harsh effects of Blockburger.</text>

            <text syncTime="4914.413" offset="19657561">Oh, I think so because as I -- as I see it, Your Honor, it's a little -- the idea of each sale as the defense in itself involve much more of a particularization to the particular fact of this case and in trying to determine what the offense is.</text>
            <text syncTime="4943.367" offset="19773440">As I said before, it seems to me that what then do we do with the situation that Mr. Rauh was talking about, where the statute as to stamps covers both purchase and sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="4969.446" offset="19877721">It's the absence of stamps that the offense as such under this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4974.441" offset="19897678">And therefore, if he sells without a written order form but one happens to prove purchase as well, does that suddenly transform it into two offenses or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4990.715" offset="19962776">If one starts putting emphasis on sales in this case, in the first place, it seems to me that when -- that isn't the statute because the-- it is sale along with transportation and concealment and so on under the Import Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5010.426" offset="20041665">But under the Harrison Narcotics Act, the order form, as I've said, has a purpose separate from the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="5019.435" offset="20077714">I mean, it's the checking part of the order form and then the stamps are in a sense suggested the offense as to the stamp part because one, there are means of -- the revenue in identifying narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="5034.367" offset="20137378">So that I think the question basically comes down to, to what extent are we going to start with a congressional purpose or to what extent are we going to come down to the facts of how the congressional purposes has been violated in this case and when Blockburger left it to the sentencing judge, I think it was because of the difficulties in trying to find a unit, particularly when you have different statutes with -- towards different purposes in mind for all the possible variations that can occur and I think the same thing is true -- would get out to counterfeiting and prohibition, possession of liquor that was involved in Albrecht.</text>
            <text syncTime="5101.720" offset="20406857">If you start saying, well, there were times when possession merges into sale, well then the question is then you have to decide well suppose it possessed it two days before, is that the -- does that then merge, is possession something different from sale in that situation or what is it -- if it's two hours before, is that something different.</text>
            <text syncTime="5125.156" offset="20500584">And it seems on the whole that you come out with a more reasonable and understandable guard for District Court Judge, if he said in determining what the offenses that Congress has created.</text>
            <text syncTime="5146.941" offset="20587729">We look at what Congress in general was trying to punish on a particular case before it, if a judge can adopt his sentence to his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5160.504" offset="20641959">A judge doesn't have to give convicting sentences when the offense is separate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5166.563" offset="20666201">And I think it's been my experience that if one looks at consecutive sentences, even when they don't absolutely seem to conform to this theory that the judge should look at the relationship with the facts to each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="5184.607" offset="20738403">The very often in totality they do, when I think in the brief we cite the situation in Bell where the judge gave two and half years and two and a half years for each of the two women, when he could have made a sentence of five years for the transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5202.686" offset="20810710">Now here, as I say there are two sales and I think that unquestionably there were -- this defendant is subject to two five-year maximum sentences, and I think they're supportable even as written.</text>
            <text syncTime="5221.339" offset="20885316">Now, what the judge did was put the first of the first three counts and all the three of the second three counts together, that's one sentence and then the second count and the third count of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5239.870" offset="20959399">Well, playing this game by the rule so to speak if the second sale is the second offense, that rests on anyone who counts two, three and four.</text>
            <text syncTime="5252.016" offset="21007987">And the first sale rests on count two, so that there's a 10-year sentence in any event in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5260.176" offset="21040692">And then if one is going to look beyond that then this case presents some other questions which I think can be settled at the District Court level under proper guidance but which are these.</text>

            <text syncTime="5763.027" offset="23052016">Now for instance, as to legitimately imported narcotics which are either stolen or which are misused by a druggist or a doctor, the only one that would be violated would be the written order form requirement because they would have stamps and they would be legitimately imported.</text>
            <text syncTime="5784.247" offset="23136967">Now, there is some fear hasn't become practical yet, there is some fear that narcotics are soon going to be manufactured synthetically.</text>
            <text syncTime="5797.250" offset="23188898">In that case, this 2174 wouldn't apply but the order form and the stamps could.</text>
            <text syncTime="5803.312" offset="23213244">As a matter of fact in 1953, Congress, in order to be prepared for this had an amendment which changed the definition of narcotics for the purpose of the Internal Revenue code to cover synthetics.</text>
            <text syncTime="5819.000" offset="23275938">So far, this hasn't actually been proved feasible but they're afraid it's coming.</text>
            <text syncTime="5824.028" offset="23296104">So that the gist of each of these offenses has a different purpose and it is possible in some -- in some instances where some to be violating and not the others.</text>
            <text syncTime="5839.762" offset="23359007">Now at the present moment, I'm willing to say that in most instances and particularly with relation to heroin, which is outlawed without -- it is usual that a person who does an illegal act file appropriate statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5860.454" offset="23441763">I think this is not new.</text>
            <text syncTime="5862.298" offset="23449182">I take it that a counterfeiter, normally, when he makes counterfeit he intends to pass it and normally any person engaged in kind does under standard definitions tend to do two or three things that Congress has said he shouldn't do.</text>
            <text syncTime="5888.188" offset="23552731">Now -- and that's what I find very little significance in this so-called unitary purpose of this legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5898.232" offset="23592856">It seems to me that if we try to draw the line too fine, if we don't recognize that each of these has a different purpose, that in a sense practically every factual situation presents an issue for -- between litigation and for differences of opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5920.500" offset="23681985">It seems to me all that we can do is to say this is what Congress had in mind, this is what Congress said shouldn't be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="5929.722" offset="23718870">Once Congress has said it shouldn't be done, it's subject to punishment and we'll leave it to the sentencing judge to say, well in any one particular case or these things so close together that maybe the sentences ought to be concurrent rather than effective.</text>

            <text syncTime="5973.511" offset="23893995">If she's correct, then I think Mr. Yancy is entitled to a different decision from the Sixth Circuit because there, in the case I cited to this Court, it was the purchase and the sale of the same heroin on the same day that was made into two offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="5988.522" offset="23954077">In other words, this can be proliferated long with -- far beyond the three statutes that can be proliferated within the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5996.097" offset="23984379">In fact, it was proliferated within the one statute in the Yancy case and the Sixth Circuit upheld the proliferation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6004.168" offset="24016666">I think wrong contrary to Bell but it did uphold it and secondly --</text>

            <text syncTime="6013.738" offset="24054909">And finally, the question of whether a 10-year sentence is proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="6018.174" offset="24072673">I'm not saying that possibly Judge Youngdahl might have given a 10-year sentence if you overruled my feeling about Boggs.</text>
            <text syncTime="6025.654" offset="24102557">The fact is Judge Youngdahl didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="6027.890" offset="24111543">Judge Youngdahl gave a five-year sentence, a fifth -- 3 to 15 on the first sale and made it concurrent on the second.</text>
            <text syncTime="6034.680" offset="24138710">So there's nothing this Court could do to change that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6037.323" offset="24149264">If this Court holds that our contention is correct, it would send the fact for remand for some sentencing problem where there is -- I don't -- didn't want it to lie here that a 10-year sentence was proper in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="6047.614" offset="24190433">Judge Youngdahl did not give a second sentence for the second sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="6051.352" offset="24205375">He gave -- made that concurrent.</text>
            <text syncTime="6053.039" offset="24212062">Therefore, there is only a five-year sentence before this Court if we are correct.</text>

            <text syncTime="6088.264" offset="24353019">This is on page 49 of our brief in Footnote 28.</text>
            <text syncTime="6093.632" offset="24374439">The -- it is true there are cases and more common situation in narcotics offensive cases, the reported ones, but this business of two offenses under the same statute purchasing illegally imported narcotics and then selling them on the same day and obviously in connection with the same transaction if you read the reported facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="6113.982" offset="24455837">I'm not certain that I recall them completely in the Martinez case but this has happened time and again.</text>
            <text syncTime="6119.223" offset="24476839">There isn't any question but that the Courts have viewed Blockburger as authorizing that result as well as the one we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="6125.663" offset="24502648">And I think the -- the distinctions here are tweedledee and tweedledum and I would like to spend this rebuttal if I may going through this case because -- a little bit on the facts because I think it is a typical case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6139.551" offset="24558132">I may stray somewhat into the facts which are in the record, which we obliged with the Court but I don't think there's any serious dispute about them and I'll stick mostly to the Government's version of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6148.983" offset="24595853">Now, what happened here is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6151.753" offset="24606929">A federal narcotics agent found an informer who was already under indictment by the federal Government and who was as the defense kept putting it was under a proposition, if he helped the Government he might get easier treatment and he also was getting per diem payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6169.247" offset="24676937">And this agent knew the defendant Gore and he led him to the defendant in a house which is significantly enough about 10 blocks from here and no more.</text>
            <text syncTime="6179.009" offset="24716016">And he introduced them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6180.304" offset="24721136">Now, there is a dispute here and we'll never know exactly what Dan Coles, the informer, said to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="6187.369" offset="24749453">But it is true that anyway he introduced the agent as a man who wanted to purchase narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="6193.760" offset="24774949">The agent says he was introduced as a man who wanted to purchase narcotics to sell on his own.</text>
            <text syncTime="6199.107" offset="24796369">In any event, he said he wanted stuff and I think that it was probably elaborated that he said he wanted heroin or cocaine because that's what was gotten.</text>
            <text syncTime="6207.786" offset="24831060">Now, in order to get almost anything except medicinal morphine, you pretty much have to get something that came into this country illegally and therefore has no tax stamps on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6218.138" offset="24872542">There was one other alternative from Mr. Gore.</text>
            <text syncTime="6221.112" offset="24884349">In order to get heroin, he probably would have had to go down and break into a Government laboratory.</text>
            <text syncTime="6224.925" offset="24899605">They are the only people who have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6226.473" offset="24905874">And the other alternative form was to rob a drugstore which I suppose would add to criminality but would obviously be separate.</text>
            <text syncTime="6235.295" offset="24941087">But however, Mr. Gore went out.</text>
            <text syncTime="6237.360" offset="24949342">There was another agent watching the house and the agent lost Mr. Gore less than a block from his house and finally he saw him come back later.</text>
            <text syncTime="6246.560" offset="24986227">Now, Ms. Rosenberg has said that there was some evidence of transporting.</text>
            <text syncTime="6251.242" offset="25004931">Now, the evidence of transporting, as the Chief Justice noted, could be only this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6257.000" offset="25027918">He pulled it out of his pocket and he gave it to the federal agent and said here is what you asked me to buy -- to get for you.</text>
            <text syncTime="6263.337" offset="25053309">Now, that's transporting obviously because anything is transporting.</text>
            <text syncTime="6266.581" offset="25066266">This is transporting but it obviously was part of the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="6270.331" offset="25081313">And I don't think these questions or verifications of the statutory crimes of bifurcations, dichotomies and bind distinctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6278.547" offset="25114122">I don't think that they stick at anybody's mind as being the essence of what is charged here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6283.330" offset="25133244">And in point of fact, the trial judge in this case continually referred as you could see at page 85 and 86 of the transcript, for this is a sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="6291.944" offset="25167726">Nobody doubted that it was a sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="6293.890" offset="25175458">Nobody saw Mr. Gore purchase it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6295.877" offset="25183504">Nobody could have known whether he purchased it in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="6298.556" offset="25194162">He was gone two hours and you could be well into Maryland in that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="6302.355" offset="25209417">Nobody saw him transport it at any distance except from his pocket to the agent's hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="6307.544" offset="25230106">So what we are dealing with here is unitary conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="6310.846" offset="25243376">Did the agent give him a written order?</text>
            <text syncTime="6312.834" offset="25251318">No, because if he'd given him a written order he would have tipped Mr. Gore up and he never made an arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="6318.071" offset="25272216">Now, when Ms. Rosenberg and the Government talk about the enforcement functions of these things, of these various statutes, we don't dispute the validity of the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="6328.175" offset="25312653">We don't say they shouldn't be on the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="6330.456" offset="25321744">We simply say that these functions are peculiarly police functions, that no separate evil is committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6337.054" offset="25348180">What Mr. Louise who was the federal agent wanted from Mr. Gore he got.</text>
            <text syncTime="6341.001" offset="25363958">He got him to make an illegal sale to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="6343.311" offset="25373153">Nobody claims it was entrapment but in the circumstances it couldn't have worked any other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="6348.725" offset="25394887">It is uncommon merely that there are three violations in the case of heroin, cocaine, smoking opium, it's inevitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="6356.634" offset="25426442">There always will be these three violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="6359.071" offset="25436264">Now, the question comes up should the Government be allowed to triple counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="6362.896" offset="25451520">Is it important to anybody that they be allowed to triple the counts.I cannot see that Ms. Rosenberg has said at any point in her argument nor can I find it in the Government's brief that one good, single, public interest or purpose is served by this, although, we freely concede that these maybe techniques which vastly help the police and the federal authorities to detect illegal sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="6385.219" offset="25540859">We cannot see that an ultimate injury has been added by the lack of the stamp or by the lack of the written order.</text>
            <text syncTime="6392.873" offset="25571474">The agent didn't intend to give the written order because if he had, he would have lost his criminal right then and there.</text>
            <text syncTime="6399.202" offset="25596761">And so, if it please the Court, we think that what we come down to here is basically an arbitrary situation in which we can see a prosecutor sitting back in his office and saying, now how about this one, should I make it one, should I make it three, should I make it six.</text>
            <text syncTime="6414.566" offset="25658201">And we don't believe that this kind of power should be given to the prosecutor and we don't believe that it's any answer to say that the trial judge or the sentencing judge will normally take care of that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="6424.740" offset="25698952">And this Court recently had experienced in the Yancy case with the situation where that doesn't always work out.</text>
            <text syncTime="6430.522" offset="25722044">And in this particular case, we have that situation before us that the trial judge gave three consecutive sentences or three of the most technical and insubstantial distinctions that could have occurred in the space of five seconds.</text>
            <text syncTime="6443.365" offset="25773453">And so, if it please the Court, we believe this case should be remanded for sentencing on one count alone with perhaps a concurrent count for the second sale.</text>
