            <text syncTime="1947.639" offset="7790550">That we have been deprived the right to carry on our lawful -- lawful activities pursuant to a temporary restraining order, the order to disclose the list of our members and it is contempt to adjudications.</text>

            <text syncTime="2020.985" offset="8083853">Now, with respect to the free speech contentions, it's our view that as an organization whose purpose is to seek to improve the status of Negroes in America and to remove color discrimination, that we are to pursue this objective in a lawful manner, and that we are entitled, and our members are entitled to associate together to pursue this objective and that we have the protection of the Constitution of the United States in so doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.248" offset="8236931">Now, it is true that under the present status of affairs in Alabama that at the present time, our aims are at bearings with the -- with State policy, but the aims of -- and the objectives of the organization which are to remove racial and color discrimination from American life are in accord with the -- with the rights, privileges and immunities guaranteed under the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.721" offset="8374857">And although Alabama in a desire to maintain segregation and so forth, we think that we have a right to pursue our objectives of the removal of segregation, even though it would be a bearing with the State policy and that the State policy in this regard has no effect whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.433" offset="8461688">Now, insofar as our members are concerned in the right of the organization to do this, it is our belief that under the -- the decisions of this Court that our members in the organization are entitled to pursue these objectives free and unsighted from any State control, acts compelling justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.413" offset="8553639">We think that's what the decision in this Court hold and we think that that has been repeated in the two latest decisions that we know of on the subject decided last term, Sweezy and Watkins.</text>

            <text syncTime="3200.058" offset="12800209">Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.460" offset="12817763">Mr. Justice Whittaker's question is what I would like to concern myself with at the outset because it goes to the very heart of the case of what this Court has to review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.034" offset="12872098">Now, the opinion of the Supreme Court of Alabama deals with the Alabama law on certiorari in a limited review which that application or petition for that particular remedial writ is limited to, and that is jurisdiction of a person, jurisdiction of a subject matter, the regularity of the contempt proceedings, for example, whether there was a correct citation, whether there was even a hearing on this contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.599" offset="13022354">All of those things will be looked at on the face of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.047" offset="13044088">That is all that you get by certiorari and that's all this Court looked at.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.177" offset="13076689">It is true and we do not deny that the Court then went on and discussed certain constitutional questions, not all of the constitutional questions which, Mr. Carter has discussed here, but certain of them, such as the question of a corporation's privilege against self-incrimination, whether a -- you can raise the rights of persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.654" offset="13170521">In other words, whether certain of these rights are personal rights and you may not assert the right of another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.483" offset="13193927">Those things were discussed, but they there were not made the basis of the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.899" offset="13211585">They said mandamus was the proper way in which to review the order to produce and that a review of that order to produce was not before that court, and I would like to -- now, enter on a -- I hope I'm not too late with the discussion of the common law writs of mandamus in Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.347" offset="13325375">It is the established law of Alabama that the review of interlocutory order of a Court of whatever nature is by writ of mandamus, petition I should say for writ of mandamus.Ex parte Hart which is cited in our brief, it is also cited in the opinion of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.663" offset="13446583">This is -- I'm reading now from the record or transcript of record at page 25, an order requiring defendant to produce evidence in a pending clause maybe reviewed on petition for mandamus, Ex parte Hart, 240 Ala. 642.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.658" offset="13518576">There is no lengthy discussion of the use of mandamus in that opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.923" offset="13543654">It was merely assumed that that was the proper way and it has always to my knowledge been the proper way to review in order to produce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.865" offset="13583360">For example, other types of interlocutory orders in a pending criminal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.741" offset="13614916">The State made what amounted to a type of motion to have the defendants examined set to the Tuscaloosa Hospital for mental examination to determine his present sanity or his sanity at the time of the alleged defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.908" offset="13683566">The trial court refused to make -- to send the defendant there as a denial of certain constitutional rights which are not relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.839" offset="13727347">The law of Alabama is that when you have an order of that nature, fundamental to the future conduct of the proceedings that it should be tested by petition for writ of mandamus, the State in fact applied for the writ and I may also say that it's still pending, not whether the writ -- whether it's a wrong remedy, but the question of whether we're entitled of the writ, whether the order is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.907" offset="13839569">Now, the orderly -- this is one of these springs, these traps for the unwary that have been criticized at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.502" offset="13881992">This is a very orderly way to proceed in these matters, every logical way to proceed in these matters, because what happens as in this case on the 11th of July, there is an order to produce at a future time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.522" offset="13958060">What is the remedy?</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.421" offset="13965584">File a petition for writ of mandamus in the Supreme Court of Alabama and they contest every single constitutional question concerning the justification of that order, the questions of its relevancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.327" offset="14029218">All of those questions maybe going into, but this petitioner chose -- didn't choose that path.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.234" offset="14056908">He waited until the 11th hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.514" offset="14069969">Now, I'm a little ahead of myself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.538" offset="14078119">I should say he waited until the 23rd of July and then filed an answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.943" offset="14099749">Now, that answer, I must disagree with counsel for the petitioner, is a rather odd type of answer and then he said, “Well, we do maintain an office and we do have a couple of employees there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.276" offset="14165055">We don't think we have to register, but we would be willing to register,” but they never really come out and say, “We're doing business in Alabama.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.225" offset="14208836">And that is an extremely important issue despite the tender of compliance with the registration statute.</text>
