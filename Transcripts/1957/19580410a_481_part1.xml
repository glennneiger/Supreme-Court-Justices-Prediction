            <label>Mr. Leonard B. Boudin</label>
            <text syncTime="44.040" offset="176065">Mr. Chief Justice and Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.252" offset="188918">These cases which are suits for passports by American citizens against the Secretary of State arose in the District of Columbia and involved the following issue, whether the Secretary of State has the right to deny passports to American citizens on the basis of political standard devised by the Secretary of State and the issues involved are both statutory and constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.671" offset="314619">So, of course, we address ourselves to the alleged lack of authority on the part of the Secretary of State under any statutes of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.313" offset="349205">The facts which I actually referred to very briefly are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.241" offset="368953">Dr. Walter Briehl is an American psychiatrist who's approximately is 27 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.049" offset="392150">He served as a lieutenant colonel in United States Army in charge of Army hospitals at the psychiatric parts of the hospitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.913" offset="423602">He is a practicing psychiatrist in Los Angeles and is connected with many medical societies, psychoanalytic, psychiatric and otherwise which I specified in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.267" offset="473025">As a member of the society as a delegate of these medical societies, he has had occasion to travel abroad, most recently in 1953 with an American passport for the purpose of attending international conventions on mental health and on psychoanalysis and reporting back to his medical societies.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.181" offset="568633">He did that in 1953, and when he attempted to renew his passport in 1955 for the same purpose acting as a delegate of his medical societies, he received instead a typical letter from the Director of the Passport Office in which it was said, that certain allegations had been made against Dr. Briehl by persons who are not specified.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.278" offset="665078">The allegations were of course not for him, but we know that he had at one time unspecified been a member of the Communist Party and that he has been a member of a number of organizations on the Attorney General's list, three or four or five, or associated with him and that he had once petitioned to the President of the United States not to prosecute Communists under the Smith Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.239" offset="772911">And so, the Department had he made these charges against Dr. Briehl said to him in his letter, “We ask you now for an affidavit as to whether you have ever been a member of the Communist Party, ever, whether you are now, and we ask you also to explain under oath your connections with the Communist-front organizations which we have described in our letter and any other Communist-front organizations?”</text>
            <text syncTime="223.397" offset="893492">Dr. Briehl demanded a hearing, a quasi-judicial hearing in view of a recent decision of the Court of Appeals, Dulles against Nathan, and instead he received an informal hearing in the Passport Office in 1955 and which he was the only witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.351" offset="961306">No witnesses were offered by the Government in support of any of the allegations and instead, the Passport Office sought to examine Dr. Briehl with respect to the subject matter of his letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.105" offset="1000385">He declined to answer the questions with respect to Communist Party membership, Communist-front organizations so-called or his associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.421" offset="1041659">And the Department refused to issue a passport to him, indeed, refused to act upon his passport application at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.625" offset="1078439">Now, the case of Mr. Rockwell Kent is essentially the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.495" offset="1093904">Mr. Kent is well-known explorer, writer and artist, internationally known of course, known -- I assume to the members of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.932" offset="1131624">He has traveled abroad very widely for more than 50 years using passports.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.629" offset="1154508">Well, passports were required as they have more recently and I assume traveling without passports in the earlier years when they were not required.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.708" offset="1190766">And the great created work manifested in his writings and in his art has been the product of this international travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.699" offset="1230785">Mr. Kent applied in 1955 for a passport to travel abroad where as he said under oath, "Pleasure and profession."</text>
            <text syncTime="317.858" offset="1271432">And I assume that the tour intermingled with him, and he received a similar letter from the Director of the Passport Office stating, “You Mr. Kent are alleged who have been a member of the Communist Party, time, place unspecified.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.081" offset="1328274">You Mr. Kent had been connected with many organizations on the Attorney General's list and you have done many other things, some of which we will now specify.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.694" offset="1366727">And Your Honors will see and I think the outrage of the kinds of things alleged on page 8 of my brief, alleged against an American citizen as mentioned as a reason for denying him liberty of movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.204" offset="1424718">For example, it has been alleged if you sought to repeal in the Walter-McCarran law.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.031" offset="1448124">It has been alleged that you urge clemency for Rosenberg, so it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.830" offset="1467246">You urge to release on bail of Steve Nelson who was convicted of sedition in Pennsylvania, he was sponsor of a petition addressed to Attorney General Brownell criticizing the use of paid informants.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.133" offset="1520431">I surely, do not have to rely upon the decision of this Court upholding the positions taken by Mr. Kent on many of these issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.712" offset="1554808">The fact is that Mr. Kent had a constitutional right to take all of these positions and at the same time to have the liberty of movement which is demanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.184" offset="1588663">Now, both Mr. Kent -- Mr. Kent also, I may say, was given the same kind of informal hearing, only with two variations.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.385" offset="1625443">His autobiography called “It's Me, O Lord” which he tells the entire philosophy of life as candidly as anyone could, was introduced in the evidence by the Passport Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.371" offset="1673404">His book was put in there for the purpose of showing that Mr. Kent had admitted that he had been connected with the organizations on the Attorney General's list.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.540" offset="1714155">And also, the Passport Office introduced testimony given by Mr. Kent before the McCarthy Committee in 1953 because the Department considered it significant that he had asserted his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.535" offset="1782073">Both plaintiffs started these lawsuits which were dismissed in the District Court under the Secretary regulations and the dismissal was affirmed in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.340" offset="1825332">Now, I should of course give Your Honors first the regulations because they are -- before I give Your Honors the regulations, may I state two concessions made by the Government which has never been made in the course of these two years of litigation or indeed in the five years in which we have been litigating many other passport cases in the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.751" offset="1902968">For the first time, we learned in this Court and into the credit of the Government that there is a constitutional liberty of movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.659" offset="1938599">They make that concession.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.523" offset="1946018">They seek to undercut it but we'll discuss that later.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.727" offset="1958870">Secondly, they, for the first time disavow the claim of inherent power on the part of the Secretary of State to control the movement of citizens abroad, a claim of inherent power that was made up to this Court's level.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.658" offset="2022609">Therefore, we come down to the preliminary questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.009" offset="2035984">Where is the statute that authorizes the Secretary of State, prevent American citizens from going abroad for profession, pleasure, vagrancy or any other reasons?</text>
            <text syncTime="521.633" offset="2086452">Now, we turn to the regulations again.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.676" offset="2102648">The regulations holds vagueness and I must say, outrageous character is apparent from their reading --</text>

            <label>Mr. Leonard B. Boudin</label>
            <text syncTime="553.624" offset="2214452">There are three categories of citizens who are not to be permitted the right to travel, three categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.218" offset="2248829">The first, category A are members of the Communist Party who have recently terminated -- or who have recently terminated such membership under circumstances indicating of the view of the Secretary of State, they are still controlled by the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.200" offset="2320718">Category B are persons regardless of a formal state of their affiliation who engage in activities which supports the Communist movements under circumstances indicating the view of the Department as subject to control.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.903" offset="2375576">And category C on page 67 are persons regardless of a formal state of their affiliation after whom there is reason to believe on the balance of all the evidence of a going abroad to engage in activities which will advance the Communist movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.424" offset="2441613">We are not concerned in this case with 51.136 which talks about people who are going abroad to violate the laws of the United States, or the people who would do things prejudicial to the orderly conduct of foreign relations or even prejudicial to the interest of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.230" offset="2500859">We are concerned with 51.135.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.811" offset="2519144">Now, the question is, where is the authority for 51.135?</text>
            <text syncTime="634.550" offset="2538162">The regulations themselves, Your Honors will see on page 66 cite a single statute, 22 U.S.C.211 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="645.964" offset="2583824">And that statute, which is on page 59 of my brief, is also disavowed in this Court for the first time, although it's the only statute referred to the regulations as a source of the Secretary's authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.205" offset="2648816">Because of time, I won't go into that statute because the Government has conceded that it does not give it the power to control travel, but merely to issue passports a somewhat different problem which I think I need not go into.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.773" offset="2707017">The Government now however, for the first time relies exclusively upon the McCarran-Walter Act of 1952, print -- 8 United States Code Section 1185 is on page 60 of my brief, and which makes it a crime during the period of national emergency proclaimed by the President for American citizens who travel abroad, to depart from the United States or to enter the United States without a valid passport.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.454" offset="2837734">Your Honors will note that this statute is not cited in the preamble to the Secretary's regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.956" offset="2871798">Your Honors will as a matter of fact note that this statute was not in effect at the time of the regulations of August 28, 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.912" offset="2903562">And finally, that the statute says nothing about an authority to the Secretary of State to control travel, and if it had said anything about such authority, I would of course call Your Honor's attention to the fact that there are no standards in the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.279" offset="2977019">Now, if this statute is to be given any meaning whatsoever, it would have to be read in conjunction with, as a complement to the Internal Security Act of 1950, Section 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.844" offset="3031353">That was the statute in which Congress decided what character of persons should not have passports.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.757" offset="3063014">And that statute appears at pages 59 and 60 of my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.725" offset="3082867">The standards set forth in that statute, the standards set forth in that statute is a single one, persons who are members -- presently members of an organization found by a final order of the Subversive Activities Control Board, to be a Communist action organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.098" offset="3160294">Present membership in an organization found by that Board to be a Communist action.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.094" offset="3184327">Your Honors can compare that particular statute with the standards set forth in the Secretary's regulations and the differences are quite obvious.</text>

            <text syncTime="818.472" offset="3273874">The Executive Order referred to in the regulations is an executive order which merely provides that the Secretary may issue regulations with respect to the issuance of passports which regulations must be consistent with the provisions of the Executive Order.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.892" offset="3339494">The Executive Order itself following the tradition of Executive Orders from the beginning of this nation set forth no substantive conditions for the right to travel and we therefore assume that when the Executive Order said that the Secretary can issue a regulation consistent with, there must be regulations of essentially the same kind.</text>

            <text syncTime="869.937" offset="3479719">Now, of course those -- those regulations, that regulation of 7856 was promulgated at 1938 in a time when a passport was not necessary for travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.022" offset="3527993">And we are now discussing a situation in 1955 and 1958 when a passport has become necessary for travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.145" offset="3556519">The President has never in any regulation, in any proclamation said that the Secretary has the power to issue regulations, establishing substantive conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.373" offset="3597479">Now, with regard to this part of the President's Executive Order as relating to the normal -- normal right to issue passports, but not to the right to deny passports when travel is a condition upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.422" offset="3649620">Now, the Secretary --</text>

            <text syncTime="919.931" offset="3679713">I think that would be true and that would -- I think that would provide for the Secretary to issue regulation of the same procedural time that he always had issues throughout the history of this country, not regulations which determine who can travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.006" offset="3771977">Now, the Government cannot find any content in the McCarran-Walter Act, either by way of authority to the Secretary to control travel or by way of determine -- setting forth the standards pursuant to which this travel can be controlled.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.136" offset="3848464">And so, the Government relies upon a statute of 1918 and the statute of 1941, predecessor statutes but both of course, dealing with war-time situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.183" offset="3892663">And the Government cites a House Committee Report in which it was indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.696" offset="3906769">There is some language there that it was intended, statute of 1918, to present espionage.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.626" offset="3934459">All that we can say to that is that it is -- the statute of 1941 -- sorry, the statute of 1952 which is here involved contains no authority of any kind and that it is very difficult to read into that statute, a House Committee Report involving a 1918 statute involving war time, and war time espionage as an authority to the Secretary in 1952 to promulgate regulations dealing with the subject of Communism and membership on the Attorney General's list.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.898" offset="4059533">And we may also add that of course in 1918 and 1941, Congress had not spoken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.883" offset="4087432">Congress had not said that a certain class of American citizens could not travel, an issue that is not before this Court of course, because Your Honors recall, there is no final order involving the Communist Party or everyone else as a result to the litigation that has been in the courts since the passage of the McCarran Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.976" offset="4159843">But what is significant is that all the reading of the McCarran-Walter Act at least gives it some meaning because we can read it in conjunction with the Act of 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.122" offset="4200385">The Secretary's reading gives him authority carle blanche to deny the right to travel to American citizens, no limitations, no standards whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.172" offset="4244584">I may say also as a final word on this subject that the regulations of 1952, August 28, 1952, were never intended to be based upon the McCarran-Walter Act, aside from the fact they don't mention it, and the fact the Act wasn't in effect then.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.070" offset="4320235">As the Government admits, as we have cited Secretary or Secretary Office is admitting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.044" offset="4348134">The regulations of 1952 are intended to comply with what the Secretary believed to be the spirit of the Internal Security Act of 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.611" offset="4398393">And it is our position that the Secretary must follow the latter of that statute and not what he conceived to be the spirit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.224" offset="4428800">If Congress determine the adequate remedy, namely the remedy by a hearing, certainly consisting of more due process than has -- than has occurred here on the part of the Secretary, namely hearing before the Subversive Activities Control Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.363" offset="4485433">And then a relatively precise statement of who it is who is to be denied a passport, namely a present member, not a person who may have, in the view of the Department, follow the Communist Party line, not a person who may have been a Communist Party at one time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.495" offset="4545933">We are not here arguing the constitutionality of the Internal Security Act of 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.118" offset="4564428">We think that the objections which I'll next turn to are very substantial objections even against that statute but are not to the same degree, namely the objections under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.272" offset="4605074">I therefore, now turn to the First Amendment part of my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.105" offset="4620330">We have seen here that there are sanctions imposed by the Secretary of State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.938" offset="4639660">The sanctions consist of a restraint of movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.579" offset="4654289">May not seem like a great restraint to a man who's confined in the present but is certainly a restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.874" offset="4679471">And it is a restraint which has had an effect upon the professional activities of these men, upon Dr. Briehl's patient, upon his medical society, upon Mr. Kent's creative work and of course upon their livelihood.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.868" offset="4735373">The admitted basis for the restraint is the exercise of lawful activities, disapproved by the Government, there's no conceptual questions to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.266" offset="4781035">It referred to the Secretary of State, the Attorney General and congressional committees or the certain character as the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.050" offset="4808098">But the fact is that these are all lawful activities protected by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.900" offset="4831504">And because of this past exercise of lawful activities, constitutionally protected, no one has ever charged a fine here on the part of either petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.779" offset="4871105">These petitioners are denied this liberty of movement given to other American citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.220" offset="4892839">I may say of course that we have called attention in our brief to the vagueness of the Secretary's standards relying upon -- inquired upon statements made by Mr. Justice Frankfurter's concurring opinion in the Burstyn case which I will not quote from at this moment, but we consider equally significant, the fact that there are lawful activities which are the basis of the denial of the right to travel, and that there is a complete indifference for the purpose of the travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.659" offset="5014570">It makes no difference from the Secretary of State whether there is a medical convention abroad or whether a man wants to paint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.855" offset="5039334">Indeed, Mr. Kent was told by Mr. Shipley, the former Director, “I will not give you a passport to go to any country for any purpose.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1837.808" offset="7351171">The Government concedes before this Court that there is a right to travel and believe that it was protected by the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.411" offset="7397564">That concession was made in this Court for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.471" offset="7413864">I don't think we are entitled to any credit for it.It's our duty and obligation to this Court and the country, as soon as we are able to learn that we are wrong to come forward and say so and we do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.009" offset="7476036">That does not decide this case however.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.031" offset="7488052">The problem in this case is much more complex than counsel has indicated to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.401" offset="7521593">The question that seems to us stops at the threshold in these two cases and is best considered if we recognize that the Secretary here refused to proceed with these proceedings, hearings or processing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.662" offset="7598602">In any respect because of one thing, the refusal of these petitioners to give the affidavit that was required in -- under the proceedings that the Secretary had set out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.841" offset="7659311">So, we then reach back into the question of what authority used there under the law for the Secretary to require of these things, and we first have to turn to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.973" offset="7707794">Now, it's been claimed that the Government never called attention before to this -- to this statute in regard to travel control, Section 1185.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.143" offset="7756487">And in our brief on pages 13 and 31, this very case before the Court of Appeals, we call attention to both of those statutes and say that they have to be construed together in order to determine the right to the parties and the authority that we conceive in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.346" offset="7825345">Now, that's not the brief in this Court, but I want to make it clear that we did call attention to this very point in developing in our brief before the Court of Appeals because it's charged here that this is the first time we raised that point.</text>

            <text syncTime="1982.997" offset="7931925">The Government would have an easy time of it, if we could just say that the Secretary has the authority to grant or deny passports either inherently or by statute and thereby, the petitioners have no rights to travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.081" offset="8020323">Because if we could put that statute to 11 (a) and its predecessors in a water-tight compartment one side and say, “You examine that.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.825" offset="8067239">I'm satisfied but this Court would come to the conclusion that for a period of -- 143, there are some three years or some lesser period, at least since 1856.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.706" offset="8118753">That power has been exercised both as an inherent power of the Secretary and also recognized by Congress in later years whereby he has issued passports and denied passport or that long history of this country.</text>

            <text syncTime="2106.351" offset="8425326">That statute of -- but first, this power was exercised by the Secretary over such a long period of years and the Government claims, I want to make this clear, that there is the inherent power in the Secretary to grant or deny the passport, but it does not claim the power in the executive branch of the Government at all to grant or deny the right to travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.270" offset="8549042">Our problem is not as difficult here because, it -- in fairness to the petitioners, it seems to the Government, that's the only way you consider this, can -- can properly consider this question is to take both of these statutes which clearly Congress intended to do in the history and it -- its consideration of this problem and try to put them together because the Congress took this power that the Secretary had been exercising over a considerable period of years as an inherent power and later recognized by the Congress and passed in this statute in which there's a general statement of the legislative history in our brief, and said, “Take this power of granting or denying a passport that you've got over here, Mr. Secretary, and you act upon it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.919" offset="8763664">And then they passed over here, a separate statute, 1185 and I'll call your attention to it in Appendix A of our brief, the Government's brief in which they said, “If you don't have this passport that the Secretary grants or denies, you can't travel.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.298" offset="8845166">So, we say that the Government must face up to the proposition that it must consider both of these statutes and we think the petitioners must barely consider both of them in order to try to construe the rights of the parties in -- in this case before the Court.</text>
