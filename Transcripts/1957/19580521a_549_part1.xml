            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">Number 549, Veto Giordenello, Petitioner, versus United States of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.191" offset="136673">Mr. Walsh, you may proceed.</text>

            <label>Mr. William F. Walsh</label>
            <text syncTime="48.738" offset="194873">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.420" offset="205636">The conviction in this case depends solely upon the admissibility of evidence ceased from the petitioner during an arrest by a federal agent executing a federal warrant of arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.998" offset="255896">There are three issues before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.649" offset="270524">One, whether the warrant was properly issued and could support a valid arrest, two, whether the petitioner waived is right to object to the validity of the arrest when he waived a preliminary hearing before the United States Commissioner, and three, whether the Government may now rely upon state law to sustain this conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.805" offset="359131">I'm going to go into that in a little more detail later but I would like to say that under state law in Texas, this arrest would not have been lawful under the applicable state statutes where -- as an arrest without a warrant and the cases which we have filed in our reply brief so state.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.575" offset="434260">The facts are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.742" offset="442932">A federal narcotics agent named Finley had been investigating the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.607" offset="466338">Mr. Finley testified that he had heard that the petitioner was going to Chicago to obtain some heroin and that he had heard also that the petitioner was back in Houston with the heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.437" offset="513672">He said that he had been watching the petitioner since before Christmas of 1955 and that his surveillance corroborated his information to the extent that Giordenello did go to Chicago and did return to Houston.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.443" offset="569678">Mr. Finley admitted at the -- the hearing on this matter that he had no personal knowledge that the petitioner committed any crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.777" offset="603011">He said that he had not seen him with narcotics in his possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.933" offset="615654">He said that he had never seen him with heroin and that during the entire time he had been following the accused, he had never seen him violate any of the laws of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.708" offset="654733">Nevertheless, Mr. Finley saw fit to go before United States Commissioner in Houston and filed a complaint in the language of the statute, 21 U.S.C. 174.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.248" offset="700918">It simply alleged that Veto Giordenello did receive, conceal et cetera narcotic drugs to with heroin hydrochloride with knowledge of unlawful importation.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.562" offset="746162">No facts were stated in that complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.347" offset="761313">Mr. Finely did not reveal in that complaint why he thought that the petitioner had received, concealed, et cetera, heroin hydrochloride or anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.429" offset="801646">Obtaining a warrant on the strength of this complaint, Finley followed the petitioner for two days.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.780" offset="819096">He obtained it on the 26th of January, 1956 and shadowed the petitioner until the following day the 27th.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.831" offset="855249">When he saw him coming out of a garage with a paper bag in his hand, and he at that time executed the warrant of arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.070" offset="888268">He claimed that he did not obtain the warrant simply, they have an excuse for arresting the accused but he also claimed that there was no particular reason to execute the warrant at any particular moment or time after obtaining it.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.331" offset="961306">Now, the petitioner was given an opportunity to have a preliminary hearing the following day, the 28th of January.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.214" offset="992758">He had an attorney present with him at the U.S. Commissioner's Office and he waived preliminary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.680" offset="1022642">The attorney who represented him or who accompanied him at that hearing has not appeared again in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.331" offset="1049287">He is out of the picture as of the moment that preliminary hearing was waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.768" offset="1062975">He did not represent Giordenello at the trial or on the appeals of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.908" offset="1091605">Giordenello was later indicted not for the offense for which he was arrested, the violation of 21 U.S.C. 174 but for the revenue offense of purchasing narcotics without the appropriate tax-paid stamps.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.921" offset="1151582">Shortly after the indictment was returned, the petitioner moved to suppress the evidence ceased during the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.913" offset="1175615">The Government filed no answer to that motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.997" offset="1195886">A hearing was held before the trial judge at which Mr. Finley testified as a witness called by the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.840" offset="1231308">Mr. Finely recounted substantially the facts which I have recounted to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.794" offset="1259102">As I say, the Government did not file any answer to the motion to suppress and the --</text>

            <text syncTime="330.575" offset="1322214">Your Honor, in view of the waiver position that the court below took, I don't think the Government is now in a position to sustain this conviction if it did not in the trial court endeavor to establish a waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.209" offset="1384803">No argument was made in this -- this -- I was going to go into this little further.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.836" offset="1399327">No argument was made by the Government on trial that petitioner waived anything when he waived the preliminary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.282" offset="1421061">Now, the contention that there was a waiver in this case arose for the first time in the Fifth Circuit in the Government's brief.</text>

            <label>Mr. William F. Walsh</label>
            <text syncTime="367.384" offset="1469440">I do for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.305" offset="1481143">We are discussing his waiver of preliminary hearing based solely upon an entry in the Commissioner's docket which was entered into evidence for other purposes at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.650" offset="1518550">If a man can waive a preliminary -- waive the right to suppress evidence by virtue of waiving a preliminary hearing and I don't think he can.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.670" offset="1550629">But if he can, I think it deserves more explanation than we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.324" offset="1573198">I think he should have a right to contest for instance whether he was adequately advised by counsel, whether counsel was there representing him or was just standing by.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.391" offset="1605486">All of those things I think would require more proof than in this record although as I say, I don't think -- and I'll develop this for the later.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.073" offset="1632235">I don't think waiver of preliminary hearing can be waiver of the right to object to an unlawful arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.720" offset="1662851">The trial judge overruled the motion to suppress without stating his reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.660" offset="1686570">The case proceeded to trial and virtually, the same testimony was elicited by the Government on trial that had been elicited by the defense at the pretrial motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.746" offset="1730978">At the trial, the United States Attorney succeeded over the objection of the defense in getting the trial judge to take judicial notice that this was an arrest based on a complaint and warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.867" offset="1787402">And I think that's significant too in view of the Government's suggestion today that in -- in the Government's brief, that somehow this case could be sustained as though it were a -- an arrest without a warrant made under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.098" offset="1844349">I think by taking that strong opposition in the -- in the trial court to the extent of having the judge take judicial notice that the Government cannot now change the issues to the extent that would be necessary to sustain the conviction on those grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.836" offset="1915298">Now, I'd like to discuss first the validity of these complaints.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.586" offset="1938286">You'll find the complaint, I believe at page 15 in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.436" offset="1969737">As I pointed out, the complaint simply alleges the Commission of an offense in the language of a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.738" offset="1998890">It has been our position that such a complaint is -- is insufficient, and we've cited considerable authority in our brief to the effect that an affidavit for a warrant must state facts as distinguished from conclusions of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.558" offset="2058136">The Government's position is that since the language in the indictment of the statute is sufficient, a complaint should be too.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.462" offset="2085825">And I say that this ignores the functional and constitutional differences between an indictment and a complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.854" offset="2119367">The -- the purpose of these two pleadings is entirely different.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.072" offset="2136189">The indictment is evidence of nothing, it is merely an accusation.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.984" offset="2151863">It is an expression of the Sixth Amendment right to be advised of the nature of the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.058" offset="2176209">Its purpose is only to put a man on notice of what it is he is accused of doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.242" offset="2196898">The Rule 3 complaint is a different kettle of fish entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.819" offset="2215184">The Rule 3 complaint is the constitutional affidavit required by the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.736" offset="2238903">In the case of a complaint on which a warrant is issued, the complaint itself is evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.077" offset="2264294">The complaint is the basis for the magistrate's decision to issue a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.450" offset="2285714">It's the only basis he has.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.428" offset="2297626">And in a case like this, the present situation is simply that Mr. Finley, the narcotics agent, was allowed to determine whether there was probable cause to issue a warrant rather than the magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.242" offset="2344960">The magistrate never knew he accepted Mr. Finley's legal conclusion that the petitioner did receive, conceal, et cetera narcotic drugs, to wit.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.593" offset="2378292">The magistrate completely advocated from his function of deciding whether there is a probable cause to the arrest, and that after all is why we have the magistrate.</text>

            <text syncTime="858.496" offset="3433953">I'd like to discuss the waiver aspect of this case briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.111" offset="3452343">As I say the waiver question was raised first by -- in the Fifth Circuit by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.835" offset="3487242">I think it's extremely significant that Giordenello was not -- and to this day, has not been charged or indicted or tried or anything for the offense for which he was arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.295" offset="3537084">To this day, no indictment has been filed under that violation of 21 U.S.C. 174, and yet they are -- the Government is arguing that the petitioner's actions in a case completely unrelated to the -- at least legally unrelated to the case which you are now reviewing, should in some way control this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.800" offset="3639171">I don't think that's proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.715" offset="3642828">I think in any event, a man ought to have a right to decide in a particular case what -- what it is he wants to do without committing himself as to all future cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.845" offset="3675324">And let me observe that there is pending in this Court as number 515 miscellaneous a conspiracy case involving the same evidence, it was used again as evidence in a -- an indictment returned almost six months after the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.012" offset="3731958">Now, can it fairly be said that a man is making a knowing intelligent waiver of anything when he is not even charged with the crime at which the evidence is to be used, I don't think so.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.553" offset="3782113">The -- I -- I think even if he were tried for the offense which -- for which he was allegedly arrested, I -- I don't think that waiver of preliminary hearing can amount to consent to an arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.807" offset="3859226">The Government is actually asking you to take that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.011" offset="3868003">They are saying, “By waiving preliminary hearing, petitioner in effect admitted through counsel that Finley did have sufficient basis to arrest him.”</text>
            <text syncTime="974.494" offset="3897887">Now, I think that's a pretty extreme view and it's going to have the considerable effect on the administration of justice in the federal courts if you agree with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.292" offset="3933100">I say that for this reason, a large number of these hearings are waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.599" offset="3954312">It is very seldom that counsel who tries a case is in on it in time to represent a man the day after the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.712" offset="3982838">If for no other reason, it usually takes a man time to get a fee together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.243" offset="4008960">If we hold the man, the waivers made at these preliminary hearings, everybody will have to demand a preliminary hearing and go through the whole business and try his case twice.</text>

            <text syncTime="1473.521" offset="5894060">The issue in this case is solely one of the admissibility of a large quantity of heroin hydrochloride ceased from the petitioner on January 27th, 1956 at which time he was arrested under a warrant issued the previous day by a United States Commissioner, which warrant was supported by a complaint which charged the petitioner with receiving and concealing heroin hydrochloride in violation of Section 174 of Title 21.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.242" offset="6072947">The petitioner contends that the evidence was inadmissible because it was obtained as a result of an unlawful arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.509" offset="6117982">He contends that the arrest was unlawful because the warrant upon which it was purported to have been made was not supported by a complaint satisfying the requirements of Rule 3 of the Federal Rules, and also that the complainant did not have personal knowledge of the facts alleged in the complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="1570.190" offset="6280673">It does this under several theories or on double basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.835" offset="6311288">First, it contends that the arrest was lawful under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.122" offset="6340441">We of course must look to the state law to determine the legality of arrest where there is no federal statute authorizing a federal officer to make an arrest without warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.810" offset="6399164">The Di Re case, I think Mr. Justice Frankfurter correctly interprets as so holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.934" offset="6431660">And incidentally in that case, I believe there was a federal officer present so that it is precisely in point here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.308" offset="6469172">The particular statute of the State of Texas upon which the Government relies is set forth at page 2 of our brief and it is Article 725 (b) of the Texas Penal Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.414" offset="6541584">Now, we did not raise this issue precisely in the court below at that time, we were under the impression that we had to rely upon Article 212 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the State of Texas which permits arrest by a private person where the felony is being committed in his presence and he has reasonable grounds to believe that the defendant is about to escape.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.486" offset="6665927">In this instance of course, no contention was made by the Government that the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that an escape was going to be attempted so we did not attempt to justify the arrest under that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.553" offset="6726113">Nor did we attempt to justify the arrest or do we attempt to justify the arrest in this Court upon the basis that the officer could have observed the crime being committed in his presence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.683" offset="6786717">Although, I must say that the interpretation of the court below in that regard which can be found in the opinion which is printed in the record and the particular portion to which I allude is at page 65, the court below did undertake by way of dicta of course because its real holding was placed upon the waiver theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.425" offset="6893610">But it did say that moreover, there was enough in the record to make it clear that an honest official might well have thought he was fully observing the legal restraints placed upon his actions and that he had good cause for arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.317" offset="6941257">Even if the warrant already obtained was invalid since he believed he saw a felony being committed in his presence, a belief that subsequent events proved to be true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.666" offset="6986606">Now, the -- as I've said, the -- the Government first supports the conviction of the petitioner upon the basis that the arrest was valid under Texas state law.</text>
