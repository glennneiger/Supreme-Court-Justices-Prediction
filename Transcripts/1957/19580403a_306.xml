            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">Number 306, The Colony, Incorporated, Petitioner, versus Commissioner of Internal Revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.476" offset="37825">Mr. Doll, you may proceed.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="a_robert_doll" startTime="20.617" stopTime="211.497">
            <label>Mr. A. Robert Doll</label>
            <text syncTime="20.617" offset="82442">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.164" offset="96653">This is an income tax case rising under the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.773" offset="123089">Specifically, the question in this case involves the statutory construction of Section 275 (c) of the 1939 Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.502" offset="170005">Generally speaking, the Internal Revenue Service must assess tax deficiencies or taxes within three years after a tax return is filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.747" offset="218906">There are certain exceptions including fraudulent returns and where no return is filed, where there's no statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.881" offset="251507">There's the so-called five-year statute which is the one we're dealing with.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.091" offset="272300">That section provides that if a taxpayer omits from gross income, amounts properly includable therein in excess of 25% of the gross income stated in the return then the Commissioner has five years instead of three to make the assessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.297" offset="357146">The taxpayer's construction of that statute is that omits from gross income means leaving out items of receipt.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.915" offset="399569">The Government on the other hand contends that where -- wherever a taxpayer's gross income is understated in a statutory amount regardless of the cause of the understatement, the five-year statute applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.523" offset="466024">In terms of volume, I think perhaps the petitioner has a better side of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.704" offset="486713">This issue of course has been up in the lower courts and the Courts of Appeal for the Third, Fifth, Ninth and Eighth Circuits have construed the statute the way that the taxpayer here is contending.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.884" offset="547527">On the other hand, the Tax Court and the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit are construed as the respondent without having construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.919" offset="587651">I think that the facts in this case point up the issue, the material facts and they are the -- this taxpayer was in the subdivision business subdividing the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.759" offset="638955">He did not build but he subdivide it.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.494" offset="649927">During the years in question, he reported all of his gross receipts from a sale of his lots but he over reported the cost of his lot sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.928" offset="699664">He overstated them.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.107" offset="708336">The principal item of overstatement was the cost of a water supply system which he had allocated certain amounts to that cost to each lot that was sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.371" offset="761417">The Tax Court held on the merits that he'd overstated the cost and I might point out that they went at some length, I think, they had to distinguish a earlier decision of theirs to decide against the taxpayer on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.379" offset="837486">As you can see --</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="211.497" offset="845949">Delivered -- delivered overstated (Inaudible)</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="a_robert_doll" startTime="215.069" stopTime="668.971">
            <label>Mr. A. Robert Doll</label>
            <text syncTime="215.069" offset="860264">No, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.671" offset="862668">It was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.467" offset="865802">It was -- as I pointed out in my brief and the Government made reference to it, this was an innocent overstatement that had a reasonable basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.750" offset="918988">Now, the Tax Court held as a -- has held in the past that in this case where the overstatement of the cost to good sold resulted in an understated gross income and -- that overstated offset item resulting in an understated gross income that there was no omission.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.716" offset="1014805">The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirm citing an earlier decision of this it -- of its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.213" offset="1044793">I think, however, at least we feel that in its opinion, which is very short, the Sixth Circuit perhaps indicated that it had misgivings because it eluded favorably, we think, to the contrary decisions in the Courts of Appeal for the Third, Fifth, Ninth and Eighth Circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.393" offset="1133505">The reasons why the petitioner thinks that it is right are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.856" offset="1159419">As I've said, our position is that omits from gross income means leaves out items of receipt.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.497" offset="1189930">First of all, the statutory language itself, the verb in the statute is the word “omits.”</text>
            <text syncTime="304.812" offset="1219187">The ordinary and normal meaning of that verb according to the dictionary is to leave out to -- not to mention the fail to include or insert.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.825" offset="1263282">Secondly, going to the legislative history, we feel that that -- that that also supports this.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.712" offset="1290762">I might, if I may, take you back to when this was put in to the -- the code.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.260" offset="1316989">It was in the Revenue Act of 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.692" offset="1334753">In the Revenue Act of 1932, the -- the statute of limitations, they're set out with a normal three-year statute and then they switched over to no statutes of -- no statute of limitations in the case of fraudulent returns and no returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.896" offset="1403507">In the Revenue Act of 1934, when this Section 275 (c) was first proposed, there was an unlimited statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.015" offset="1444049">We feel that the legislative history shows that what Congress had in mind was to catch situations that were, to certain extent, similar to a fraudulent return or filing no return at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.902" offset="1503608">They -- there was no statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.292" offset="1517087">But going to the committee reports themselves, if I may just briefly and I'm looking at page 14 of the petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.252" offset="1572989">In the -- the first pertinent bit of legislative history was a House subcommittee report starting in the -- at the second paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.563" offset="1614158">"Your subcommittee is of the opinion that the limitation period on assessment should also not apply to certain cases where the taxpayer has understated his gross income on his return by a large amount, even though fraud with intent to evade tax cannot be established.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.107" offset="1688346">It is, therefore, recommended that the statute of limitations shall not apply where the taxpayer has failed to disclose in his return an amount of gross income in excess of 25% of the amount of gross income stated in the return.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.398" offset="1757518">The Government should not be penalized where a taxpayer is so negligent as to leave out items of such magnitude from his return."</text>
            <text syncTime="450.319" offset="1801195">Following this subcommittee report, there was a hearing that was held before the full House committee and at that time, Mr. Roswell Magill was with the Treasury Department and he had a -- a discussion which is set out on page 15 of the petitioner's brief with -- with Congressman Jerry Cooper of Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.629" offset="1894504">Now if I may just prefer to the first question and answer, "Mr. Cooper, what we really had in mind was just this kind of a situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.318" offset="1941211">Assume that a taxpayer left out, say, a million dollars, he just forgot it.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.255" offset="1964931">We felt that whenever we found that he did that we ought to get the money on it, the tax on it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="499.556" offset="1998158">Following the -- this hearing, the House Committee adopted a report also providing for an unlimited period for assessment and their report which is similar to the one I read, the -- the subcommittee report is on page -- well, 16 and also the Senate Finance Committee report.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.868" offset="2107455">Now, we feel that when you take the -- the ordinary meaning of the statute and when you go to the legislative history that is clear that -- that what Congress was really concerned with was leaving out items of receipt.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.116" offset="2172447">After all that -- that is what you put in the tax return.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.387" offset="2189479">Now, in this case where we have an understatement of gross income that results from -- from an inflated item, there's nothing left out of this return, there's too much put in.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.256" offset="2244963">And from a logical standpoint, I don't think Congress was -- was aiming at that.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.231" offset="2268891">For example, when you take your gross income, there is -- there are deductions from gross income.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.742" offset="2310896">In other words, Section 23 of the 1939 Code permits rent and so forth to be deducted from gross income to get your net income.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.885" offset="2359484">Well, quite obviously, the statute would not apply regardless of how far overstated these rent items or salary or what have you, these deductible items.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.930" offset="2411624">Now, we feel that those items, those overstated items where there are errors resulting from a -- from an overstatement below the gross income line that are clearly not -- will not bring a statute into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.766" offset="2470975">The Congress didn't -- didn't have in mind that an error above the gross income line and the cost of good sold that -- that they weren't really concerned with that type of an error.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.429" offset="2521652">They -- they were concerned with left out items.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.412" offset="2537639">And I -- I think that perhaps the reason for that -- there's a reason for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.752" offset="2562926">In the case of overstated deductions, as well as overstated cost of good sold, that figures on the tax return.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.339" offset="2605349">To get the benefit from that figure, you've got to claim it on the tax return.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.049" offset="2624157">Well, the revenue agents, they don't have the same problems of trying to discover where the error is.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.529" offset="2658116">It's on the return and they can just verify it from -- from what's already there.</text>

            <text syncTime="698.021" offset="2792072">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.521" offset="2794057">The opinions that have construed the statute as we're now urging or -- it's -- the -- there's the Uptegrove case in the Third Circuit, which was the first case decided and that is exactly the same on the facts to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.646" offset="2862498">That was a cost of good sold case.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.943" offset="2879739">The Court, the Third Circuit then decided the Deakman-Wells case where a taxpayer showed his gross receipts on a schedule attached to his return but then subtracted items from it to convert itself to a -- a cash basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.095" offset="2956330">The -- the next decision was -- I think was the Goodenow case in the Eighth Circuit and Slaff versus the Commissioner, which was the Ninth Circuit case and Davis v. Hightower, a Fifth Circuit case.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.813" offset="3023203">All those cases adopt this construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.177" offset="3056640">There's one further point that I would like to mention -- mention the -- the statutory language, the legislative history and what we think is the logic of the interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.535" offset="3110139">In 1954, Congress enacted Section 6501 -- 6501(e) (1) (A), which is the successor to Section 275 (c) of the 1939 Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.269" offset="3177012">In -- and I'm looking at page 23 of the petitioner's brief, the footnote sets forth the new -- the new law.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.788" offset="3235109">Under A, the general rule, Congress adopted precisely the same language that was contained in Section 275 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="818.487" offset="3273874">It made two changes, which aren't -- which are not material, but they adopted substantially the same language.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.319" offset="3305221">If the taxpayer omits from gross income an amount properly includible therein, then for purposes of this subparagraph, they go down to subsection (i).</text>
            <text syncTime="840.868" offset="3363422">In the case of a trade or business, the term "gross income" means the total of the amounts received from sale of goods or services prior to diminution by the cost of such sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.624" offset="3418488">In other words, in that subsection (i), Congress is essentially adopting the -- the construction we urge in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.534" offset="3458090">The Government has contended that Congress changed the law in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.296" offset="3489123">We admit that the law was changed to the extent that they started out with the old law and then they added new language.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.714" offset="3518798">The purpose of that new language, we think, was obviously to approve the prior construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.550" offset="3542100">They agreed with it and we think it was to explain it and to clarify and to say what the proper construction of the predecessor section was.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.966" offset="3603853">In the committee reports that I referred to, there are in each of those reports, statements of a general nature to the effect and they start out the reports on that thing and I'm looking at page 14, the House Subcommittee report.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.367" offset="3701447">"Your subcommittee is of the opinion that the limitation period on assessment should -- should also not apply to certain cases where the taxpayer has understated his gross income on his return."</text>
            <text syncTime="938.965" offset="3755781">The respondent attaches great significance to the use of the word “understatement” there.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.166" offset="3792562">The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held and we think quite correctly that that was of a general introductory nature that after that language in each of the committee reports, Congress wants a specific example of -- of what they were thinking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.060" offset="3880229">The next sentence, for example, “It is, therefore, recommended that -- that statute of limitations shall not apply where the taxpayer has failed to disclose in his return an amount of gross income in excess of 25% of the gross income stated in the return.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.203" offset="3956715">The Government should not be penalized where a taxpayer is so negligent as to leave out items."</text>
            <text syncTime="999.438" offset="3997675">In conclusion, we think that the common sense reading the statute is confirmed by the legislative history and the logical approach is to show that that -- that the only way -- what Congress really intended was to give the taxpayer two extra years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.257" offset="4080953">He's already -- the -- the Commissioner already has three years, that he was to have two more years where a -- items of receipt were left out of the return, the computation of gross income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.371" offset="4129437">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="1400.418" offset="5601593">Gross income is the basic figure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.419" offset="5621656">There are very few computations in arriving at gross income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.199" offset="5644748">Once you get to net income, there are a whole series of computations involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.463" offset="5661780">There are even more when you get to the tax itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.644" offset="5674527">Accordingly, if Congress had talked about a 25% omission from net income as stated on the return, it would be perhaps embodying many mathematical errors of the taxpayer in computing his tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.437" offset="5729698">By picking gross income stated in the return, it picked a figure which does not include many computations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1540.605" offset="6162390">Now, the Committee reports are set forth at pages 19 to 20 of the Government's brief and they both refer to this law in the following language, the change enlarges the scope of this provision to include cases wherein the taxpayer understates gross income on its return by an amount which is an excess of 25% of the gross income stated in the return.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.624" offset="6286420">They clearly meant “omits” to include the word “understates.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.329" offset="6309303">Now it is true as taxpayer has pointed out that the committee reports giving examples also go on to describe omissions as a leaving out or a failure to disclose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.691" offset="6366668">But when this language is read in the full context of the committee reports, it's clear that it refers to a failure to disclose as gross income or a leaving out of items of gross income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.019" offset="6424033">None of the examples given refers to a failure to disclose or leaving out of gross receipts, gross proceeds of sale or anything other than gross income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.674" offset="6478681">Now there are some cases such as salary, dividends where gross income and gross receipts may be synonymous, but none of the examples given is an example of a gross receipt that is not gross income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.594" offset="6542315">And the statute proceeds to provide when the omission from gross income of an amount properly includible therein shall be crucial, and I think this is the really important part of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.059" offset="6596232">It is crucial only if the omitted amount is in excess of 25% of the amount of gross income stated in the return, and is thus apparent that Congress was primarily concerned with a relative size of the omission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.708" offset="6670733">And I should point out here that this very provision makes it clear that Congress was not thinking in terms of how long will the Commissioner need to catch up with the particular error here because it obviously takes him just as long to find an omission of a smaller amount from gross income as it does to find an omission of a larger amount from gross income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.951" offset="6779716">The Committee reports make it clear that Congress merely decided that taxpayers failing to state as gross income, relatively large amounts which should be included therein should run the risk of the longer statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.535" offset="6858083">Congress was concerned with results, not causes, with relatively large omissions and not that those may have been honest omissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.362" offset="6897371">In fact, the Committee reports show that Congress intended to cover honest mistakes in this Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.899" offset="6927569">Dishonest mistakes are covered somewhere else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.193" offset="6940735">And it meant to require taxpayers to run the risk of the longer limitations even if they omitted the doubtful item from gross income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.176" offset="6980650">In other words, it's all -- it's frequently a difficult question is to whether a particular item of gross income should be reported in one year or another year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.264" offset="7020983">And if you leave it out, you don't report it as gross income for a particular year, it's an omission within the meaning of this Section and the committee reports give that specific example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.290" offset="7069153">In fact, it was because of this that the House Bill was amended by the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.949" offset="7095693">The House Bill would have provided no statute of limitations where it was the 25 -- an omission in excess to 25%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.058" offset="7128189">The Senate thought that that was too harsh where the error was an honest error and that applied your -- limitations should be provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.133" offset="7168522">This last part of the statute also provides the measure for the amount omitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.851" offset="7191301">It speaks of 20 -- in excess of 25% of the amount of gross income stated in the return, and as I have pointed out, the only place where gross income is fully stated in the return is in the schedules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.874" offset="7259429">And our position has been misconceived by taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.705" offset="7278759">It was misconceived by the Third Circuit in the Uptegrove case where they say that the Commissioner's position is that if the final figure in the gross income computation is understated then there has been an omission from gross income within the meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.800" offset="7347200">That is not the Commissioner's position and has never been.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.769" offset="7371024">If there is an error in transposing an amount of gross income from a schedule to the phase of the return, but the amount is fully disclosed and is disclosed as gross income in the schedule, there's been no omission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.460" offset="7429747">If there's a mathematical error, that is an error in adding up the figures on the phase of the return, that is not on omission from gross incomes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1870.545" offset="7482096">We look at each figure which describes a particular type of gross income either -- either received or approved by a particular taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.467" offset="7525773">And that that is clearly the Commissioner's position is made clear by two factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.949" offset="7555762">First of all, the Commissioner has an old statute of limitations problem with respect to mathematical errors on the phase of the return.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.891" offset="7591497">There is a 100% mathematical verification of returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.922" offset="7611664">There are so many returns filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.412" offset="7617620">The Commissioner cannot audit all of them, a relatively small number, perhaps 10% are audited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.034" offset="7644056">But there is a mathematical verification of returns and the Commissioner needs not -- not even three years to accomplish that objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.688" offset="7686687">And that brings me to the fact that there is -- even in the court a special treatment for mathematical errors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.248" offset="7728901">They are treated separately, Section 272 (f), which was added to the code at the same in 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.058" offset="7760144">At the same time, this statute was added provide its -- provides that the Commissioner does not have to send the 90-day notice of his determination of a deficiency in the case of a mathematical error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.137" offset="7804447">If it's in the taxpayer's favor, he merely sends him a letter with a check.</text>

            <text syncTime="1956.740" offset="7826913">He sends a letter and tells him to remit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.560" offset="7838198">And accordingly, our position is that there is an omission from gross income under the terms and legislative history of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.165" offset="7888562">Whenever the gross income stated in the various schedules of the return is deflated by more than 25%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.309" offset="7925133">Now we submit that that would be the logical construction of this statute even if the proposition were coming up way back in 1934.</text>

            <text syncTime="2967.340" offset="11869309">Under Section 22 (a), that is the general definition of gross income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.775" offset="11895014">It -- they set out certain specific items if dividends are includible in gross income and gains or profits -- from any source, whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.868" offset="11943393">Now, the respondent takes that word “gains” and he goes over -- over to Section 111 of the Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.533" offset="11974113">Now, that section provides that in determining the gain from a sale of property, there's a difference between the gross proceeds from a sale and the cost of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.099" offset="12024372">Now, he takes two sections of the Code, 22 and 111 and says they that in enacting Section 275 (c), Congress was intending to cover this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.724" offset="12078811">Now, I submit to you that when Congress enacted 275 (c), they weren't concerned about Section 22 (a) or Section 111, they were concerned with omits from.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.344" offset="12133355">Now, the reason they use gross income is because as a matter of fact, it is generally synonymous with gross receipts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.438" offset="12165747">And the majority of tax returns, the income and the receipts are the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.375" offset="12193437">That's what's includible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.338" offset="12201273">That's -- and from that, you take off figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.615" offset="12218410">Now, it so happens that in the case of a manufacturing concern that you take your gross receipts and you subtract from that, your cost to good sold and from an accounting standpoint, you come up with gross income but the only thing includible in gross income are the receipts.</text>

            <text syncTime="3509.467" offset="14037786">That's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.478" offset="14057848">One further point, if I may, that the respondent has stated that there is a long -- that there is quite a bit of judicial history that there've been in a long period of time where the cases adopted one view.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.114" offset="14124408">We -- we don't think that is true in this particular case, this type of situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.496" offset="14145933">The cases by and large that the respondent relies on, the real issue in that case was where there were on a schedule attached to a return, statements to the effect that certain alleged receipts were nontaxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.179" offset="14224614">The courts in the early cases held that that was not a sufficient disclosure and that therefore, that was an omission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.593" offset="14262335">I think the -- that type of situation would then -- cured by the 1954 law in the second subsection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.936" offset="14307683">We think it actually -- the -- the issue didn't come to our head, really, until the Uptegrove case, which was the first conflicting case with the Reis case as far as the Circuit Court of Appeals go.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.780" offset="14355017">Thank you.</text>
