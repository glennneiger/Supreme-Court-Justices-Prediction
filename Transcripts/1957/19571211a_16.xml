            <text syncTime="23.698" offset="94772">These cases here on appeal from a decision of a three-judge court sitting in the Eastern Division of the Northern District of the State of Illinois, in which two of the participating judges refused to annul and set aside an order entered by the Interstate Commerce Commission in a preceding entitled Andrew G. Nelson, investigation of operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.070" offset="204278">The order commanded the carrier to cease and desist from transporting by motor carriage certain commodities which I shall describe.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.673" offset="246596">Our notice of appeal and your -- and the jurisdictional statement was seasonably filed and this Court noted probable jurisdiction, November 13, 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.899" offset="299572">The order opening the proceedings before the Commission and issued before you a hearing was even set, recited that it contained a positive statement that the carrier and I quote, “Has been and now is transporting commodities outside the scope his permit.”</text>
            <text syncTime="94.637" offset="378462">The order then proceeded to name 20 specific commodities.There is no question here but that we hold the commodities that are described in that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.273" offset="425064">And in view of the fact that a -- relevant term here is the term “stock in trade of drug stores”.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.384" offset="453486">We should point out here, there is no question here but that every article named in that order was regularly found up on the shelves or the counters of the average drugstores throughout the areas served by this carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.616" offset="514403">This sin which we are said to have been -- to have committed is not hauling the commodities but in not delivering -- having delivered them to drugstores.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.015" offset="571977">It is the contention of the Commission that our authority which we think we shall establish is to haul commodities indicated by the term “stock in drugstores” must be read as though they were appendant to that authority, the clause but only when moving on moot with sale in a drugstore as the intended ultimate objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.593" offset="694335">Thus, our authority to haul the drugs is conceded --</text>

            <text syncTime="176.925" offset="707605">-- if they be moved and delivered to drugstores.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.355" offset="725368">The basic question here is the authority of the Interstate Commerce Commission to read and do a -- an authority to operate by implication only.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.968" offset="775837">A clear restriction of the authority can -- extended by an operation and when no restriction of any kind appears on the face of the authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.536" offset="822126">The basic facts are not complicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.083" offset="836232">On January 2nd of 1936, Andrew Nelson, an individual filed an application for a grandfather permit, seeking authority to continue in the business of contract carriage in which he had engaged with a prior 16 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.827" offset="903210">He described that business in his permit as the contract carriage of store fixtures, miscellaneous commodities and household goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.743" offset="950962">Nowhere in the application itself was there any reference made to drugstores.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.465" offset="973845">During the following 11 months, after the case was given a docket number and assigned to Supervisor (Inaudible) of the Commission of Chicago Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.328" offset="1017208">The -- the Commission made an intensive examination of the past operations of this carrier during and prior to the grandfather period.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.358" offset="1065378">During this several inspection trips that were made to his office, they were supplied and were continually before them were more than 30,000 serially numbered delivery tickets.Each ticket evidencing a specific transportation service performed on a specific date for a specific person.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.391" offset="1161509">Those 30,000 tickets covered every movement of freight which this carrier had made since he started in business 16 years before.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.034" offset="1200065">It is difficult to concede how the Commission could have had more detailed information of what the scope of the grandfather operations of this carrier were.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.218" offset="1244787">After considering all the evidence before it, the Commission made its finding of fact which was contained and the basis for a compliance order authorizing the carrier to continue operations upon compliance where the insurance and the rate schedule provisions of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.270" offset="1329006">The word is often used as compliance order but the only part of that order that has any bearing here is the finding of fact in establishing what the scope of the grandfather business was.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.847" offset="1375295">Thereafter, from it issued, which we shall see as a matter of law, was to -- must reflect the authority inherent in the grandfather operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.830" offset="1427226">We believe the action of the Commission and the evidence to which we will refer will be more comprehensible.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.132" offset="1452513">If viewed before the background of two important statutory principles, the first of these is the principle that grandfather rights stand directly from Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.252" offset="1520953">There is no administrative function of the Commission exercised whatsoever as to the scope of the permit authority to be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.343" offset="1565362">That was your -- that is proven by your decision in the Alton Railroad case in which -- in which have you had referred to and commented upon, and quoted from several times since in which I think your language was that the grandfather clause guaranteed substantial parity between the authority to be given the carrier, the scope of the authority to be given and the scope of his grandfather operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.088" offset="1688346">The statute -- the reading of Section 209 (a) of the statute establishes this very clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.830" offset="1715304">Once the Commission performs the only administrative function assigned to it in case of a grandfather carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.217" offset="1744771">Once the Commission determines what the scope for those grandfather operations were, the rights so found in here in the character as a matter of law, the Commission has nothing left to do but to command it to obey the command of Congress and to quote the statutes, "Issue such permit without further proceedings."</text>
            <text syncTime="463.550" offset="1854171">The second point of law was established by this Court's decision in the Seatrain case.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.164" offset="1880607">It was that under these acts, a permit cannot be retroactively amended or otherwise changed except as provided by Section 212 (a) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.195" offset="1928777">You will recall the Commission decided the Seatrain case issued to permit and close the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.516" offset="1954064">A year or so later, he decided that he'd made a mistake and tried to reopen a hearing and issue a new and restricted permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.544" offset="1998158">You held that it was without the power of the Commission to take such action on any operating authority given under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.049" offset="2048104">In this case, the Commission has sought to avoid the violation of your decision in the Seatrain case by stating, “We have done nothing to this permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.881" offset="2095438">We have neither added nor subtracted from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.782" offset="2107037">We have simply determined what the rights secure your head from the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.322" offset="2137234">We have seen that the rights which the carrier had from the beginning were rights given by the statute to continue to haul what he had been hauling in 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.893" offset="2195540">Obviously, that's impossible to -- to interpret the grandfather permit without looking at one of two things or both.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.768" offset="2226991">You must look back in this case to 1938 and see what the Commission found as an administrative finding was the scope for the grandfather business.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.100" offset="2272340">And perhaps you may also look to 1935 to evidence establishing what the scope of the grandfather business was.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.383" offset="2309433">We have here a decision which holds that they have only established what rights we had from the beginning but openly stating that they have made that determination refusing to look at any fact that occurred prior to 1942, the date, the permit issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.130" offset="2384457">In other words, the convict -- the Commission convicts itself of having interpreted here a grandfather right stating it's deliberate ignorance and disregard of those facts which the statute makes controlling of a grandfather right.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.038" offset="2472124">We think that this decision of the Commission can be established as equally erroneous even if we disregard and then we'd have to treat it as an ordinary permit having no basis on grandfather rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.167" offset="2524578">To establish this, we will have to explain a little bit the general theory of restriction as it's reflected in the Commission's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.232" offset="2560836">Early on in the administration of the Act, this manner of restriction, speaking now of restriction and permits yet to be issued came up -- came before the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.207" offset="2612767">The first important case was the Keystone case, taking a name of one of the carrier applicants in which the Commission had before it some 80 odd applicants seeking to serve Atlantic and Pacific Tea stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.191" offset="2672744">Many of those applicants' applications were based upon grandfather service of those stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.206" offset="2696777">The Commission's decision in that case and particular to the special concurring opinion of that brilliant Commissioner, Joseph B. Eastman states clearly the concern which the Commission felt of the need for strictly limiting these grandfather carriers so that every possible restriction reflected by the evidence before them should be reflected in the right which they got.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.091" offset="2812343">They discovered that these carriers who were hauling this material for A&amp;P, in the grandfather period had served nobody but the A&amp;P stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.775" offset="2855079">So there emerged from that decision what is called yet today the Keystone restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.631" offset="2878485">The Commission pointed out that if you take all the commodities in the A&amp;P stores and simply authorized these carriers to haul all of those commodities, you would in effect give them a general authority to haul almost every type of merchandise that move for anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.579" offset="2946299">Therefore and based upon the detection of these fact that the grandfather service had been limited to this type of customer, they granted the authority to haul all of those commodities but added language subsequently as follows, but only under contracts with those operating retail food stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.874" offset="3031458">That is a Keystone restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.916" offset="3051624">That establishes the Commission's policy restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.411" offset="3065626">Now, we must tie that up with their declaration in the Atlantic Freight Lines case, in which they said in another case where restriction by implication was sought, whenever it has been our intention to place a limitation upon authorized operation, we have done so specifically and have not left our intent to be implied.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.963" offset="3171788">One of these Keystone cases involved a carrier named McAteer, Simon McAteer.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.868" offset="3203448">In a reconsideration of the whole case, his application became the titled case.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.162" offset="3228630">His first compliance order describing his grandfather rights was issued the same date as was ours, February 14th, 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.893" offset="3271471">His case went to further hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.394" offset="3285473">In the further hearings, the Commission described what McAteer's grandfather business had been as the transportation of stock in trade of A&amp;P stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.683" offset="3342629">This authority which issued the finding of fact was that he had been handing -- handling goods such as are handled by A&amp;P stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.421" offset="3389649">Thus, the Commission at that time, the very time for it was issuing regarded both those terms as synonymous and each is falling in the classification of description of a commodity by reference to place of sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.136" offset="3480451">Following this famous case, establishing -- when this Court approved it in the Noble case, the right of the Commission to insert such a restriction, the Commission apparently then turned its eye towards the restrictions that had -- that they permitted and issued before that time and to the possibility of restricting those permits to reflect the authority they had merely acquired.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.850" offset="3615347">To understand the program which followed, it's necessary to understand briefly the mechanics of commodity description of contracting common carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.706" offset="3666756">There were several devices used to -- in commodity description to restrict the commodities to those in a certain class.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.822" offset="3699252">First, there was the device described by the Commission, a description by reference to place of sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.158" offset="3724539">Next, there was a description by reference to the industry served.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.419" offset="3749616">There was another one by reference to the type of commodity -- type of vehicle required to transport the commodity.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.089" offset="3780336">As illustrative of the first, we have the Keystone case and this commodity such as are sold in a certain time of this -- this type of establishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.243" offset="3820878">As the illustration of the second, we have the Dart case, packing house product supplies, primary supplies, supplies of a particular industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.557" offset="3870198">Then we have the -- the description, petroleum products such as must be moved in tank trucks.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.434" offset="3905724">The first attempt to whittle down a commodity description in which place of sale was the basis, was made about 1945 or 1946, the case was decided in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.415" offset="3965597">When the Commission attacked the Chicago carrier who had authority to transport commodities such as are sold by wholesale food houses, I may not have that verbatim, but that was the substance of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.724" offset="4042815">The contention made by the Commission there was exactly the contention here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.863" offset="4063399">This means commodity sold by wholesale food houses but only when moved to wholesale food houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.349" offset="4093388">The Commission -- the Court found, refused to read that restriction and the permit when it were -- it was not stated and said that since food houses hauls -- customarily sold beer, the carrier to the haul beer any place he wished for anybody.</text>

            <text syncTime="1407.432" offset="5629701">In each case, long after the permit issued, the Commission construed it -- conceived a new idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.387" offset="5657496">In the Salvino case, the idea was that factory supplies and factory materials should be separately defined and set up new and separate definitions setting over into the material description, articles that had formally been on the factory description.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.374" offset="5717473">In the Bird description, they restrict to the former definition of groceries by -- interpreted to mean only such groceries that are edible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.186" offset="5752686">In this case, they attempted to read into the complaint by restriction, by implication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.295" offset="5785078">A theory which never appeared or was never known until 1950 or some eight years after our permit issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.221" offset="5824784">In each case, the carrier came forward and each case the Commission ordered them to stop hauling anything except what was included in this new description.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.864" offset="5867416">In each case, the carrier came forward and said, "But I haul this during my grandfather period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.741" offset="5890926">I have a right to haul it under a statutory right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.412" offset="5905554">In each case, the Commission said, “We're not interested in that.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.488" offset="5921855">In fact, their declaration to the Bird case was, “In our opinion, the petition should be denied in toto regardless of the scope of the operations of petitioner's predecessor in 1935."</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.428" offset="5977652">Now then, I think when a Commission and under -- it enters a program where they are free to express such defiance, such disregard of statutory rights, it is time for this Court to put it -- a restraining hand upon the Commission and call their attention to the fact that the scope of grandfather rights is something over which they had an open draw.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.016" offset="6080052">We cannot assume that Congress so carefully withheld from the issuing Commission the power to control the scope of these grandfather permits then intended that the Commission five years later should have complete power to whittle and chisel at it as they -- as their administrative necessities drawn.</text>

            <text syncTime="1548.554" offset="6194155">Mr Blanchard stated, this is an enforcement proceeding brought by Interstate Commerce Commission resulting in a cease and desist order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.339" offset="6229264">The appellant corporation holds an ICC contract carrier permit by truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.466" offset="6253819">This is not a common carrier but a contract carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.606" offset="6266358">Those carriers were allowed to discriminate between customers as to price infusing the haul and are closely confined as what -- with whom they can deal and what they can haul.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.691" offset="6310661">The permit recently issued in 1942 authorizes the appellant corporation to carry three categories which are listed, store fixtures, household good, and stock in trade of drug store.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.121" offset="6384431">This permit was issued then to Nelson in 1942.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.019" offset="6396029">In 1951, they requested ICC to transfer -- they approved a transfer to a corporation bearing into Nelson's name.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.708" offset="6442736">In 1953, the present owners of the corporation bought the stock of the corporation, acquired the corporation and the permit which apparently was the only asset they acquired from the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.254" offset="6484950">It took no trucks or other equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.201" offset="6496758">Starting in 1953, they proceed to engage in large great variety of hauling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.992" offset="6519954">They recently engaged in hauling 100-pound sacks of dried glue to a manufacturer of gummed products.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.211" offset="6552764">Drums of lard weighing over 400 pounds each, cases of beer and wine, automobile battery, and 100-pound bags of dried milk, a large number of other commodities, all in truck load lots.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.667" offset="6614622">There is no suggestion by the permit holder corporation that this could be considered store fixtures or household goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.343" offset="6657358">None of this -- the theory is, they are stock in trade of drug stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.335" offset="6677316">None of these goods ever had any connection with the drugstore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.534" offset="6690064">They were not shipped to a drugstore, by a drugstore at no time would ever intended to become stock in trade of any drugstore at any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.998" offset="6727889">Appellant argues that nonetheless it may carry such items under its permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.699" offset="6746697">Has the permit properly construed authorizes the hauling of all these items as stock in trade of drug stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.413" offset="6773551">The theory is that since some drugstores sell milk, they can carry milk, that 100-pound sack of dried milk is still a stock in trade of a drugstore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.402" offset="6813571">In some drugstores or since many drugstores sell glue, they can haul 100-pound sacks of dried glue to the gummed products manufacturing company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.520" offset="6854008">The Commission after a hearing decided that was not what the permit meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.308" offset="6873130">The Commission has said that appellant may transport commodities which are part of the stock in trade of any drugstore and commodities which the time of their movement are intended to become part of the stock in trade of any drugstore.</text>

            <text syncTime="1762.385" offset="7049509">The first is that the permit, as issued in 1942, authorized the hauling of the commodities he is now hauling and he then argues that the Commission has attempted to take away rights he once had.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.284" offset="7101127">The second contention is that whatever the permit says, the corporation today has the right to haul whatever its predecessor's interest was hauling in 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.987" offset="7147938">He then alleges that it was error for the Commission to refuse to consider evidence of what was actually hauled in 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.074" offset="7180225">I believe those are the two principal contentions, first, the construction of the permit and second, whether notwithstanding the permit the Commission should've considered what he was actually hauling and allowed him to continue to haul it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.044" offset="7240098">Now, the question is what did the permit -- first question is, what did the permit mean in 1942 when it was first issued -- issued?</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.415" offset="7265593">We do not claim the right to cut down grandfather permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.158" offset="7280536">We do not claim that we can violate a rule of construction and bring about the kind of change we could not bring about by an amendment of a permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.649" offset="7322540">Now first, the Commission construed this permit on its face and they found that it was not ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.753" offset="7346991">The Commission's construction appears in the record at 24, is basically what I said, commodities that are intended to go to a drug -- as far as the stock in trade of drug store, commodities that are part of stock in trade of a drugstore or intended to become so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.499" offset="7409894">We think that's the plain meaning of the language, stock in trade of drug stores is -- if you're limited to hauling stock in trade of drug stores, you're never to hauling goods that are in fact stock in trade of a drugstore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.984" offset="7463915">There is no -- we do not accept the view they're -- they technical or special meaning to this phrase that the McAteer case which Mr. Blanchard had said held the two were the same, his argument stems from the fact that in the course of a long opinion, both phrases were used, could such as sold grocery stores and stock in trade of grocery stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.324" offset="7565270">They were not used as parallels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.012" offset="7583974">In the opinion, there's certain no holding that they were the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.738" offset="7598916">Appellant corporation's argument here basically is, believe it's clear, that this construction is clearly erroneous because the method of limitation was unknown in 1942.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.009" offset="7655967">His argument is that the Commission construction of the permit is not entitled to the respect that Commission's construction of their own permit usually would have that it must be upheld unless clearly erroneous because in 1942 whenever the Commission mentioned a commodity it meant you could carry good such as that commodity that the -- what he calls the intended use restriction of what's -- which in the jargon at the Interstate Commerce Commission has become more and more used at the intended use restriction was unknown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.899" offset="7799536">This is a later device dreamed up later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.164" offset="7820643">He says that prior to 1949 which is when he gives the intended use test beginning, if a trucker was authorized to haul commodities such as lard, he could haul for anybody at anywhere without regard to its intended use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.606" offset="7882397">And since Andrew Nelson was authorized to haul stock in trade of drug stores, his argument goes, this must necessarily be construed to mean he can haul any commodity similar to that which might be or customarily would be carried in a drugstore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.996" offset="7959928">The -- the error in his argument is -- I think in the argument advanced here I think is clearly demonstrated by reference to the very permit here in question and to the cases cited by appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.427" offset="8029623">Appellant's brief, page 24, refers to the classification of motor carriers or property in two motor carrier cases, 703, either shows that no -- intents to show that the only way of describing commodity was by generic or class terms about a type of equipment to be operated and naming them specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.046" offset="8152085">The permit here for the item immediately preceding stock in trade of drug stores is household goods, a much more common form of permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.754" offset="8194926">There are many more household good carriers that are much more common.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.712" offset="8206838">This was one of the types of commodities listed in the classification of motor carrier property in 1937, five years before this permit was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.949" offset="8247693">Carriers of household goods, I'm now reading from page 709 of two motor carrier cases, household good carriers include carriers both common and contract, engaged the transportation of property commonly used in a household when a part of such household equipment or supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.569" offset="8342256">They could carry a commodity, not any commodity to anybody, they carry this commodity when a part of such household equipment or supply, and they also carry furniture, fixtures, equipment, and the property usual in an office, museum, institution, hospital or similar establishment when a part of the stock, equipment or supplies such office, museum or the similar establishment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3131.297" offset="12525087">First, he said there was error to refuse to consider evidence as to pre-1935 hauling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.608" offset="12546403">I must say take some courage to come here having objected, extraneously objected below to considering any evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.621" offset="12582452">I refer to page 114, 115, and 116 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.984" offset="12603873">The Commission under the Seatrain case and I'm reading appellant's counsel statement below for the Commission hearing officer, Commission under the Seatrain case is without authority to consider them to existing prior to the issuance of the permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.144" offset="12656536">Over on page 115, my objection goes to consideration of any fact existing prior to the date of issuance of the permit this carrier in 1942.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.168" offset="12696660">Over on 116, the Supreme Court decision, the Seatrain case and others stopped the Court -- Commission from going back and considering anything that happened back at the permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.138" offset="12744516">Again, I do without -- I -- as I do without waiting my contention that nobody has the right to go back to the permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.558" offset="12770220">The Commission sustained its position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.304" offset="12785162">The ICCs officer putting on the case took the opposing position at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.751" offset="12807001">The Commission sustained a position which appellant urged below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.334" offset="12821316">He now said that was, this horrible error requires sending it back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.181" offset="12836676">They gave me what I wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.365" offset="12845453">The -- first place on the merit, there's nothing in this record so that 1935 he was doing anything except hauling for Walgreen drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.184" offset="12876696">The testimony of Andrew G. Nelson that he got out, a lot of these businesses after prohibition, he was hauling sugar during prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.298" offset="12909192">And he go out of the marble business on the record 137 and then record 155, the Commissioner asked -- the examining office asked him, if he could've shown during the one year preceding 1935, he could have shown any receipts for other transportation in Interstate Commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.830" offset="12975229">He was engaged in local commerce around Chicago, local hauling in warehouses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.405" offset="12989544">And Interstate Commerce, any receipts other than those of Walgreen, he said, he did not know.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.005" offset="13007935">Now, finally appellant argues that regardless of the permit it may now haul whatever Andrew Nelson he did in 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.118" offset="13040431">His position is that the permit makes no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.097" offset="13056313">That he can -- he can haul at any time, accept the permit, ignore it, haul whatever he likes and then defend against the compliance order on the ground the permit was not broad enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.384" offset="13105528">There are several objections to this argument.First, before the Commission, he stated, he never raised this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.223" offset="13128829">He said the only issue is record 204.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.931" offset="13139696">The only issue in this case is what certain language in the permit means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.317" offset="13161221">None of the exceptions the examiner's report mentioned this operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.070" offset="13176268">Secondly, the statutory language makes it clear that appellant has no right to engage in transportation outside the permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.792" offset="13207092">The -- the statue printed on -- the very section he relies on 209, printed page 33.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.462" offset="13237812">No person shall engage in the business of a contract carrier by motor vehicle unless there is enforced with respect to such carrier a permit issued by the Commission authorizing such person to engage in such business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.840" offset="13291311">Now, the requirement, Commission issue a permit for grandfather cases is, the Commission shall issue such permit without further proceeding if application for such permit is made to the Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="3418.493" offset="13673953">Whatever intent that a Congress -- that a Commission 20 years later could do to this permit, what this Commission is trying to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.908" offset="13715540">We think when Congress reserved the grandfather rights to a carrier that merely meant those rights to be something permanent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.413" offset="13749603">They delegated to the Commission the authority of finding out what those rights were.</text>

            <text syncTime="3447.396" offset="13789518">The whole theory of my adversary's argument is that this carrier's authority stems from a permit issued by the Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="3459.274" offset="13837061">Our authority stems from what rights given by Congress to haul what we were hauling.</text>

            <text syncTime="3641.016" offset="14563997">Having declared their -- their refusal that consider anything before 1942, nine times in their brief we find a reference of this statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3652.873" offset="14611435">The record shows clearly the statement was prepared by the Commission's employee, the -- the applicant objected to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.470" offset="14641842">It was explained that under the law this is all you need to show and it's fully explained at pages 90, 153 to 154 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.694" offset="14690743">Thank you.</text>
