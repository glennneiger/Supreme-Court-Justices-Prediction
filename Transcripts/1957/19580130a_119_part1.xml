            <text syncTime="28.192" offset="112744">This case involves a book majors expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.441" offset="149734">It involves the question of payments made for the expressed purpose of inducing the commission of a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.779" offset="207099">The amounts involved are for three years, 48, 49 and 50, about 19,000 wages paid to men who record the bets, and 8700 approximately of rent for the first year and a total of about 32,000, below 32,000 for each of the subsequent years.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.890" offset="371461">The payments are in violation of the statute of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.268" offset="397061">The bookmaking establishment was operated in the central business district of Chicago in a hotel.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.274" offset="433006">It moved around a number of times because the police caught up with it or interfered with its activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.980" offset="463830">And the hotel owner furnished a new location in the same hotel and there's a direct finding that the hotel owner knew that these premises was being used for the particular purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.728" offset="542824">There's a direct finding by the Court that it was in violation of statutes 336 and 582 of the State of Illinois.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Lee Rankin</label>
            <text syncTime="149.656" offset="598622">Could recover?</text>
            <text syncTime="151.291" offset="605100">I -- I question in this particular situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.483" offset="617848">There are some Illinois cases referred to in the petition -- in the respondent's brief in which they -- the Court dealt with the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.910" offset="659540">But there, it was a question of suit between the parties which is a different problem under Illinois law, one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.872" offset="687438">And secondly, it was a question of whether he leased the particular premises rather than, whether he permitted the use of the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.504" offset="733936">Now, I -- I haven't found any Illinois case to the effect that if he permitted the use of the premises, he could recover.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.024" offset="772075">And one of the cases cited by the respondents distinguishes particularly between that language of leasing or permitting the leasing or rent and permitting the use, which is the word of the statute called attention to the difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.083" offset="844278">The particular statute involved is set forth on the -- in the Government's brief on page 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.987" offset="879909">And the language that we think was violated and that the Court agreed and found particularly, runs down to the seventh, the eighth line or any person who records or registers bets or wagers or sells pools.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.272" offset="1005087">Now, the acts that these men were paid for were specifically found to be the registering of bets or wagers.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.309" offset="1045211">Then, you follow down the same statute about six lines where it reads or being the owner, lessee or occupant of any room shared tenement, tent booth or building or part thereof, knowingly permits the same to be used or occupied for any of these purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.800" offset="1163180">Then, on the following pages, Section 582, which is the regular accessory statute and provides the liability in that event.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.651" offset="1214589">Now, there is no question of what this was -- it satisfied the requirements and accessory too, but there are the particular violations of the law of Illinois that's involved here, excuse me, and the payment was made for the deliberate and expressed purpose of having these crimes committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.428" offset="1313646">So, we comment within this general doctrine referred to by the Court in Lilly, where the expenditures are made themselves in violation of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.359" offset="1393371">Now, the Court of Appeals reversed the case and held that the expenses were deductible on the ground of their Doyle decision, an earlier case similar -- very large with similar facts, on the theory that where the particular expenses were an integral part of the business operation, they were deducted, but if they were concomitant an they're referred to fines and penalties as concomitant, an example of concomitant, then they would not be.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.319" offset="1585215">Now, when you get down to it, it's an almost impossible rule to try to apply anything of that character.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.882" offset="1619487">If you would try to apply it, for instance, in your Textile Mills case of this Court, it seems to us that you would have to hold that the regulation in that case which prohibited a deduction for lobbying could not be valid even though it frustrated a clearly defined public policy, because the whole purpose of that activity was to lobby to the Congress a return of these assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.668" offset="1758668">And they had to hire somebody to do it and they hired their only logical people to do it, the publicist and two lawyers, but this Court said, "The regulation was valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.835" offset="1807256">The expenses were not deductible because they would frustrate such a policy and it was proper for an interpretation of this provision 23 (a)," which the Court said was ambiguous to say that it would not be considered where there was this ordinary and necessary where it would be a frustration of a clearly defined public policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.154" offset="1924598">Now, concomitant is demonstrated by the fines and penalties that the Court referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.316" offset="1965244">If you would take integral and try to apply it in this situation, then you get down, we think, to the proposition that the more illegal, any business operation is, the more clearly you're going to give him a deduction for whatever expenses he does and -- and specially, if those expenses are violations of law themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.038" offset="2112052">Now, this is not expenses that carry on this business activity, in order to forward it and thereby indirectly contributed to an illegal activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.292" offset="2177149">These expenditures are in themselves and by themselves, whether this -- these particular respondents had any connection with this business of violation of law and that's the issue involved in this case, whether or not because a man is operating an illegal business or is operating a legal business.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.271" offset="2296999">He can hire somebody to violate the law and then deduct the amount that he spends for that purpose, either in the case of the recording of the bets or the rental, as a part of his business expense.</text>

            <text syncTime="621.037" offset="2484140">I understand your premise should be that he wanted -- he did this to -- whether it's an illegal business therefore it's not deductible and you also referred and say if he hired somebody.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.784" offset="2531056">Suppose he had 50 employees in there, are you saying he couldn't deduct to them what he paid them?</text>

            <text syncTime="638.615" offset="2554358">Maybe I can illustrate it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.200" offset="2564702">Assume that there wasn't any statute like 336, insofar as it covered the rental or use of the premises for an illegal purpose or assumed that -- that clause is out of it and assume the other part about recording bets or wages is out of it and you have all of the rest of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.855" offset="2667416">Now, the respondents would be violating the law by carrying on the business, but this would be an entirely different case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1114.052" offset="4456176">But even apart from that, there is -- it doesn't seem to me in that recognition, any recognition of the principal that he has to got out and hire other people to violate the law and that the federal government is approving any such in extension of his activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.095" offset="4548336">Now, it's very interesting if you'll look at the economics of this picture too and it's set out in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.036" offset="4580101">This operation was close to a million dollars a year for three years in the gross wagers that were taken in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.458" offset="4629734">And the gross return on those wagers, on this business was about six and a half -- six and eight tenths percent the first year and it worked down to five and a half, a little over five and half.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.508" offset="4706011">The last was a three-year and six something second of the three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.115" offset="4728372">Now, that is the return on the amount of money that was bet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.488" offset="4757943">That isn't the return like in the ordinary business on the amount of money you got invested in it yourself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.050" offset="4788140">So that if you follow a theory that it's all right and approved by the federal government just because you're taxed under the wagering tax law, a man for conducting a wagering business that you approved, the development of that business as much as he can develop by violating any laws of any State or the federal government as a part of it, then you can see how rapidly he increases his property in accordance with the figures right here in this case where he makes such a return proportionately on every dollar that he gets in of wagers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1256.547" offset="5026168">Now, the legislative history in regard to this matter is we think equivocally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.255" offset="5064934">In the first place, when the 1913 law was passed, the problem of it being discussed by Senator Sterling was not this question of 23 (a) at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="1281.726" offset="5126896">That was for revenue purposes and that's been recognized by this Court many times, but he was discussing in relation to that, the question of deducting loses from gains and that was the particular discussion there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.206" offset="5180813">We think it sheds no light on this particular problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.813" offset="5195233">Now, the 1951 legislative history does, we think, have some bearing upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.032" offset="5232118">We think it's equivocal and it's not very helpful, but we think it -- we need to deal with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.427" offset="5265659">Because at that time, Senator (Inaudible) proposal was brought before the Congress and that was a package deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.376" offset="5301499">It didn't involve just this question of disallowing any deductions for any illegal business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.482" offset="5329920">But it also included the question of registering anybody that would have got more than $10,000 a year from one or more illegal businesses, the maintenance in keeping of records and books and that those records and books have to kept over a period of seven years and that there should be provision for inspection of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.549" offset="5422184">Now, when this came before the Senate, the Senate Committee said that there hasn't been sufficient time for a study of it for them to act on and that was why they didn't act at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.085" offset="5480281">And we think that the whole picture was so confused as to the number of different problems that were presented to the Congress in that legislation, so that --</text>

            <text syncTime="1438.192" offset="5752686">Then the -- the other reason that we think would contribute in some degree is the proposal and I think it was 1954, the American Law Institute to disallow any deductions of -- that were in connection with an illegal business.</text>

            <text syncTime="1460.040" offset="5840144">The Government thinks that the reason -- that the action was not taken was that it was so clearly shown by all of the Court decisions up to that time, the trend and the attitude of the courts, the Tax Court and the other courts, that they would not interpret ordinary and necessary as including deductions for such activities as were frustrating and clearly defined public policy that the Congress didn't think it was necessary to change this Section of the statute which had been so interpreted for great many years.</text>

            <text syncTime="2015.079" offset="8060238">That case, Your Honor, also related salaries and wages deducted by a bookmaker and it involved an identical statute of that of the State of Illinois that rose at the State of Texas.The provisions of the statute were alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.242" offset="8116872">They're both held as being misdemeanor and still, Commissioner acquiesced in that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.525" offset="8146024">And the result of that -- that acquiescence was to serve as a president for all revenue agents to act and their allowance of salary deductions in cases of a similar nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.422" offset="8193672">What possibly, Your Honor, is maybe what it means of the Commissioner trying to overcome the statement of the Attorney General made before the American Bar Association of Boston in 1953, where it stated the policy of its department.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.301" offset="8257202">Henceforth, disallowed the reduction of all illegal expenses incurred and illegal enterprises and he also indicated that he had the consent of the treasury department to aid in the formation of that policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.413" offset="8325642">Now, our position is that these expenses are specifically provided in Section 23 (a) (1) (A) by the ordinary and necessary and required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.909" offset="8371618">Now, Section 23 (a) (1) (A) provides specifically that all expenses incurred or paid during the taxable years in the operation of any business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.534" offset="8426057">Now, it doesn't say throughout the business as pointed out by Judge (Inaudible) in the Heininger case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.730" offset="8450821">It places no words of limitation and as specifically this additional language, including reasonable compensation and rents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.576" offset="8494289">There's a specific provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.510" offset="8502021">We don't have in this case the similar situation where Congress denied specific deductions when it saw fit to reenforce the sanctions of its statutes such as it didn't wait the stabilization act or in the Defense Production Act or the -- the Defense Production Act amendments of 1950 and 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.328" offset="8593241">So, when Congress intended to specifically disallow deduction, it's so provided by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.456" offset="8613721">We also had an income tax law that was pointed out the other day, but the income tax law denied this, the deduction of losses from gaining in excess of the (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.971" offset="8659801">It cannot be set off against other income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.556" offset="8670145">So, we have again a specific manifestation of what the intent of Congress is, by this -- by the legislation which it has enacted and which it comes before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.945" offset="8719778">Now, the judgment said in the Heininger case, is about this expense to what have been no business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.739" offset="8750916">There would have been no profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.767" offset="8751020">There would have been no income tax, to say that these expenses are not ordinary and necessary, to say that that which gives a light being that ordinary and necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.013" offset="8807967">And (Inaudible) Your Honor, we have a provision of the income tax law, that said you should keep records of the very purpose of these sheet records, the very purpose of the -- these individuals recording these debts is to keep the particular record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.501" offset="8865959">But the Internal Revenue officers, we shall maintain, that we shall keep and those are the specific salaries that are being disallowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.664" offset="8898560">Your Honor, Section 23 (a) does not require that any limitation be placed upon it by any state law or do we have to look as to what the meaning of salary compensation and rents means or any -- nor can the State place limitation on that.</text>
