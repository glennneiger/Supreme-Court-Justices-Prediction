            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="10.028" offset="40020">Did they deal with both the statute and the constitutional provision?</text>
            <text syncTime="14.006" offset="56007">They did both, yes they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.766" offset="66978">Now these petitioners are not the only persons or churches in California who felt themselves unable to sign the oath, there are two cases pending before Your Honors, in the form of an appeal in which this Court has not acted upon the appeal, they are on behalf of the First Methodist Church of San Leandro and the First Unitarian Church of Berkeley.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.519" offset="162064">First Methodist Church of San Leandro as appears from the record in this Court, in that case deemed that Methodist discipline prevented it.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.537" offset="202083">If it were to comply with Methodist discipline from complying with this requirement, the first -- these two churches with leave of this Court have filed briefs amici, as has the Philadelphia yearly meeting of the Religious Society of Friends in Southern California.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.300" offset="281182">The Orange Grove yearly meeting took the position that this requirement violated its conscience and its commitment to Christ and therefore that it was unable to comply with this requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.719" offset="338860">Now in a word, the nub of the argument which I shall present is something like this, that the requirements, particularly again the statutory requirements, open due process because unreasonable and arbitrary and more particularly those, I'm still stating the summary of my argument, that on the one hand there is no support for the legislation or the constitutional amendment in any real need or any real danger existing in California warranting this or similar legislation on the one hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.519" offset="522031">And on the other, the requirements are so broad and sweeping, affecting thousands, hundreds of thousands more than a million persons in California, are so broad and sweeping on the one hand and so deep and offensive and intrusion into privacy and into the privacy of the spirit and the mind of man, so that a balancing of any real concern for national security of California on the one hand and off the sweeping inroads on the other by this legislation would require this Court, assuming this Court were to adopt and follow the narrowest kind of jurisdiction which it could take, assuming this Court to exercise its jurisdiction most reluctantly in view of the fact that was involved here as state legislation, as distinguished from federal legislation in giving the states the widest reasonable scope for authority in dealing with so difficult a problem as national security, assuming all these -- that this legislation opens federal due process.</text>

            <text syncTime="239.393" offset="957544">I say to Your Honors first quickly and then I hope to demonstrate it, that there is no substantive base, there is no support in any real evil, or to borrow a phrase from one of the justices of this Court, there is no solid threat to any security in California warranting this legislation.</text>

            <text syncTime="306.057" offset="1224202">I intend to -- I hope that my argument before it is concluded will impress Your Honor as a narrow nonetheless, so I shall proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.721" offset="1278851">I suggest to Your Honor that there is no showing in this record and that no claim can be made by the respondent of any solid threat to the security of the nation or to security of California, which would support this kind of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.244" offset="1352934">The first question to ask is, what is the purpose of the legislation and here I shall advert to the arguments for the constitutional amendment and we shall see to it at these are filed within 24 or more hours from now in sufficient quantities for the justices of the Court, in urging the support of a proposal which became the constitutional amendment, it was urged, there is no valid reason why such exemptions should be allowed communists and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.191" offset="1500682">So far as the voters of California was concerned, this -- the constitutional amendment was designed to deal with the problem of communists and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.234" offset="1544882">This contention or this position is supported by the majority of the court below which in the record at page 52 explained this legislation and these provisions and said this was California's, and I quote "Endeavor to protect itself from subversive infiltration."</text>
            <text syncTime="410.007" offset="1639967">Now of course I suppose when a court or a person these days talks about subversive infiltration he's talking about the infiltration of communists.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.319" offset="1673195">Now I say to Your Honors that there are no facts, supporting the assumption that communists have infiltrated into the institutions of California that are entitled to tax exemption, and that this is not only not posit on fact but is pure fancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.984" offset="1775909">In the argument to the voters Your Honors, no claim was made that there were any communists who had infiltrated into the various institutions that under California law are entitled to exemption as for example charitable organizations, churches or cemetery.</text>

            <text syncTime="472.792" offset="1891161">There is no claim so far as the argument is concerned that any of the agencies or persons that are entitled in the California law have been subject to infiltration for communist, as far as any of them are concerned.</text>

            <label>Mr. A. L. Wirin</label>
            <text syncTime="488.114" offset="1952392">The list is brought, there are many other persons entitled to exemption one of them is veterans and other are veterans of growing crops, householders are entitled to exemption, income tax payers are entitled to some exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.766" offset="2014981">Now -- but what I am saying is that there is no claim in the argument that any of the persons or organizations, no matter how many they maybe that are entitled to tax exemptions had been victimized or subjected to infiltration by communists.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.390" offset="2073496">On the contrary, no such claim was made in the legislature which adopted this legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.968" offset="2103798">No single judge in any of the proceedings in the California courts suggested that there was any basis for any such claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.251" offset="2136921">On the contrary, the dissenters of the Court affirmatively stated and I refer to the record at page 60, there is no evidence that plaintiff church or any of the organizations seeking tax exemption, this is the second new paragraph, and the second sentence in the second new paragraph on page 60, there is no evidence that plaintiff church or any of the organizations seeking tax exemptions are infiltrated by communists or other disloyal persons or that they are in any danger of such infiltration, the evidence is all to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.741" offset="2310896">This solemn statement by three of the seven justices was not disputed again say by the majority of the Court, on the contrary in the record at 56, the majority of the Court implicitly accepts this statement and appraisal after it -- page 56 after the majority of the court recognizes the integrity and the morality of the principles of the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.300" offset="2429179">It goes on to say, I'm reading from the first new paragraph, the sentence in the middle of the page, it is inconceivable that any organization actuated by the doctrine of pronouncements there declared, namely by the Unitarians would knowingly harbor within itself any person or group of persons who would engage in the subversive activities referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.094" offset="2540356">As a matter of fact Your Honors, nowhere throughout the proceedings in the courts below and not even in the brief filed by the respondent in this case, has there been any suggestion that this legislation is needed, because of any claim that communists had infiltrated institutions that are ordinarily entitled to tax exemptions as the basis for support of this legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.193" offset="2664699">Indeed the California legislature made no findings at any time of any danger to the institutions from communists and this is in marked contradistinction as we point out in our brief, that when California legislature was dealing with the problem of subversives in education, public education and in government, it affirmatively made elaborate findings with respect to such infiltration and such dangers, similar to the findings made by the legislature of New York in the case which was before this Court in Adler.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.100" offset="2816313">This case does not have findings by the legislature comparable to the findings or comments made by committees of the Congress with respect to the old declaration which was involved in the Douds case.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.932" offset="2871693">And the reason no findings were made and no suggestions that this danger exists in California is because there is no basis in fact for such a claim, because this claim is pure fancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.036" offset="2936059">Now I have talked thus far solely with respect to the first half of the requirement which every tax payer must avow about.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.611" offset="2978377">There are two halves, and they are in the conjunctive and no one may receive a tax exemption in California, unless he otherwise is entitled to it, unless he or the organization involved avows in the conjunctive or avows negatively in the disjunctive that the person or organization advocates -- it doesn't advocate the destruction of government by violence and so forth, nor advocates the support of a foreign government against the United States in the event of hostilities.</text>

            <text syncTime="921.234" offset="3684833">Now here again there are no findings by the California legislature, there is no suggestion by any judge in California, there is no claim by our opponents that this legislation has support in the actual advocacy by churches, by anyone in California anywhere during the last decade or more or ever in the history of California since we became a state in the union, there is no suggestion, the natural fact any person in California has actually advocated the doctrine which is set forth in this legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.402" offset="3861525">I have called it a peacetime sedition statute, that's what it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.754" offset="3878975">The Congress of the United States has seen no need of adopting legislation comparable to this so long as we are at peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.342" offset="3921293">Despite the numerous and thorough going investigations conducted by congressional committees and federal executive agencies, no one has suggested that anywhere in United States is there any danger from persons or organizations with the churches or otherwise preaching this doctrine which is the subject matter of the second half.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.680" offset="4010632">Now I'm making that argument merely to demonstrate to the Court again that certainly with respect to this completely novel provision, Californians were seeing things which no one else in the nation saw.</text>

            <text syncTime="1289.745" offset="5158975">Now if there is substance to my argument that in California there is no support, no solid support for this legislation, I move on to the second half of my argument that the method which the legislature of California resorted to in dealing with any problem, assuming a problem really existed, is so sweeping in its effect as to become unconstitutional under narrow due process requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.135" offset="5296483">Let us look for a moment though I had said that major thrust of my argument will be with respect to the legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.816" offset="5323233">Let us look for a moment at the constitutional amendment itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.931" offset="5343713">So far as that amendment is concerned in practice in California, it applies to every -- to virtually every adult person in California because every adult person in California, they indicated in their answer to Mr. Justice Brendan is entitled to some kind of an exemption whether by way of the income tax or householder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.014" offset="5428036">And therefore so far as the constitutional amendment is concerned, it applies to -- well the population of California is something like 14 million, if we talk only about the adult population, it applies perhaps to some 10 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.963" offset="5495850">So far as the faith of the requirement is concerned, it is the most sweeping, that any I know of, but when we turn to the legislation, which requires oaths the number of course becomes considerably less.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.061" offset="5564186">We've indicated that the figures with respect to those who are subjected to this oath requirement in California include certainly over a million persons in California, for there are as we indicated in our brief, over a million veterans in California, who actually have secured exemption who have submitted to this oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.486" offset="5669930">And the figures further indicate there are a 11000 churches in California, there are more than 11000 churches in California, but 11000 churches have subscribed to this oath, I shall make some explanation about that perhaps later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.384" offset="5737535">So you have it here a requirement, which so far as the constitutional amendment is concerned blankets the entire state and so far as the legislation is concerned involves a very substantial, a very large number.</text>

            <text syncTime="1771.025" offset="7084095">Let me spend a few more minutes taking about the particular constitutional problem and the particular position of the petitioners whom I represent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.664" offset="7134563">Now they take the position that as churches, they have had the right from time immemorial and they still have that right, free from coercion, or restraint, or prohibition, or inhibition of any kind, no matter how direct or indirect, no matter how manifest or subtle from the state so far as the preaching of their doctrines are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.691" offset="7250756">And that these doctrines include particularly the right of churches to preach to their followers and to the world, the commands of God and the demands of morality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.548" offset="7318152">And that requiring churches as a condition of securing this ancient and traditional and accredited tax exemption recognized by every state in the union, recognized and existing in California for over a century, that churches must be free not to preach whatever doctrine they may want, certainly not to engage in any conduct they may want without accountability to seizure but free from accountability to the State of California and to seizure prior to any advocacy as to what their principles and their religious doctrines are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.878" offset="7531416">The churches are unwilling and unable particularly in the light of the history of test oaths to which I have made some reference, prior to advocacy to declare in advance as a condition of getting tax exemption as to what doctrines the churches will not advocate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.592" offset="7626292">For of course once they do that, they can readily subject themselves to accountability to the state for the doctrines that they do advocate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.703" offset="7666730">Now I don't want to engage now in a long discussion about the metaphor used by this Court of separation of church and state, but certainly throughout our history, this Court has acknowledged that there are many situations when the state may not demand of a person or of an institution to avow prior to advocacy pertaining to the belief or the advocacy of the person or institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.049" offset="7828167">And so here we think that the requirement, particularly the oath requirement now, violates constitutional limitation because the effect of such a requirement is to make full freedom of expression on matters sacred and important to the community, a little bit the less likely if churches have to attest to their non advocacy as a condition of securing a tax exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.708" offset="7978736">Let me make this suggestion to the Court as I sit down and reserve a few moments for reply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.948" offset="8011755">On page 6 of our reply brief in the appendix, we have set forth a statement by the Northern California-Nevada Council of Churches with respect to this requirement, as we have on pages just previous to that by the American Baptist Association, the Methodist Discipline, the position of the American Unitarian Association, the position for instance on page 3 of some 600 Protestant ministers who are in the Southern California Council of Protestant Churches, which appears for instance at the footnote 5 on page 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.571" offset="8202240">And finally let me call Your Honors' attention because I think it demonstrates the point that I'm urging, to the language of the Northern California-Nevada Council of Churches representing all of the Protestant Churches in Northern California and Nevada, I won't read it but it is before Your Honors, in which that group states its vigorous castigation and opposition to communism, to Marxian communism, but nonetheless protests the loyalty oath requirement and yet calls attention to the fact that most of our churches have signed this oath because of the desperate need the churches have for the funds which are involved in a tax exemption.</text>

            <text syncTime="2573.550" offset="10294126">If Your Honors please, may I run back over a little of the introductory legislative and constitutional procedure which my opponent has covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.221" offset="10376882">In California, constitutional amendment may be accomplished in one of two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.756" offset="10422962">The constitution maybe amended only by popular vote, state wide vote of the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.735" offset="10454936">The measure to accomplish such amendment may initiate with the legislature or it may initiate by petition, initiative petition signed by the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.573" offset="10526198">The measure so prepared whether by the legislature or by initiative petition, is by the Secretary of State submitted to the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.781" offset="10595056">The measure is entitled, a title given to it and which is then put on the ballot which the people vote on by the legislative counsel, a legal advisory body set up with that as one of its duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.843" offset="10671334">Upon that submission the vote is taken and the amendment becomes effective according to that vote as of the date of the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.077" offset="10708219">Now here in California there's a provision which has been in the constitution since 1900, which was then adopted as a constitutional amendment Article 13, Section one-and-a-half, this is the so-called church exemption provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.015" offset="10799961">It's not a general provision for exemption of church property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.579" offset="10818247">It is not a provision at all exempting church property as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.534" offset="10838100">It's an exemption of property by reason of its use, an exemption of property used solely and exclusively for religious worship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.830" offset="10879269">It is not an absolute and unconditional exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.412" offset="10901629">It is conditioned on such use.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.459" offset="10913750">It is further conditioned on the property not being rented and rent received for the use by the owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.096" offset="10964323">Now this constitutional amendment of property used for religious worship continued in that form with minor extensions until 1952, the exemption of property as used for religious worship was extended to cover property which was intended for such use that is property which was in the course of construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.057" offset="11068186">It was extended to include as well as the building and the land whereon situate equipment of the church.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.116" offset="11104444">It was extended as well to include parking areas and parking lots, but that exemption of church property, not under that category but exemption of property used solely and exclusively for religious worship continued until 1952 when one of the measures called in question here was adopted by popular vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.008" offset="11248013">The people in 1952 by statewide election adopted the constitutional provision that notwithstanding any other provision of this constitution, no person or organization which advocates the overthrow of the government of the United States by force or violence or other unlawful means, or who advocates the support of the foreign government against the United States in the event of hostilities shall receive exemption from any tax imposed by this state or any county, city or county, district and so forth.</text>
