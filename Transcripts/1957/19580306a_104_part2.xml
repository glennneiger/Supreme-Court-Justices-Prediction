            <text syncTime="512.856" offset="2051344">If I may, I'd like to make reference to the case of Columbia Terminals Company against Lambert which is exactly an off-course with this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.897" offset="2095543">In both cases, we had interstate commerce involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.969" offset="2111843">In both cases, the interstate commerce involved was a transfer between railroad terminals.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.893" offset="2143504">In both cases, the state required that the carrier apply for a license in order to engage in the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.371" offset="2177463">In both cases, the state -- the carrier refused to apply for that license.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.275" offset="2209019">In both cases, the counsel for the state asserted that the state was without power to apply these economic tests, those tests which were rejected in Buck against Kuykendall.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.958" offset="2267742">The state was without power to apply those tests to an interstate motor carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.110" offset="2288431">Now, the Court in that case held that the carrier was not eligible to complain about the constitutionality of the statute until such time as they had first applied for a license and had it refused on improper grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.710" offset="2366798">Perhaps, I should also make reference to the case of Bradley against Public Utilities Commission of Ohio.</text>

            <text syncTime="612.953" offset="2451749">The Public Utilities case came after the Buck and Kuykendall case.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.791" offset="2471079">In that case, in the Bradley case, the Court was asked to decide whether a state could impose a requirement for securing a certificate of public convenience and necessity to an interstate motor carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.312" offset="2537221">The Court held that it could do so, so long as the grounds which -- on which it was applying that statute were grounds relevant to the police power and the power to control the highways.</text>

            <text syncTime="1728.888" offset="6915448">And perhaps I can save time by simply surrogate and following on the points the counsel has made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.588" offset="6946273">In the first place, counsel attempts to say that by reason of the fact that Transfer is what he calls an independent contractor that Section 202 (c) doesn't govern here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.837" offset="7019311">Well, now Section 202 (c) (2) says that it governs transportation by motor vehicle by any person whether as agent or under a contractual arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.528" offset="7094021">Now, whatever else you can say about the contract between Transfer and the railroads which appears beginning at page 25 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.358" offset="7161417">It's a long contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.003" offset="7168000">It is a contractual arrangement but no question about that, so it is squarely within the terms of Section 202 (c) and you can't escape that by saying, "Well, obviously if you have a written contract whereby you make somebody an independent contractor that nevertheless would mean it's a contractual arrangement."</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.161" offset="7256607">Now, the counsel has mentioned that the recent decision of this Court last Monday in the Public Utilities Commission of California against United States and perhaps I do not need to advert to that but it seems to me this one sentence that I would like to read fits this case perfectly on all of this talk about exhausting administrative remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.012" offset="7364023">And that is this, but where the only the question is whether it is constitutional to fasten the administrative procedure onto a litigant -- onto the litigant, the administrative agency may be defied and judicial relief sought as the only effective way of protecting the asserted constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.613" offset="7454407">That is precisely this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.116" offset="7464438">And the Chief Justice says perfectly characterized this because after you get all through with your so-called administrative procedure, nevertheless, the Chicago City Council says you've got to come in and lobby us before you can operate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2371.728" offset="9486838">The sole question in that case was whether the employees of Parmelee were by virtue of the arrangement between Parmelee and the Railroads if that make those employees, railroad employees, so that they were entitled to the benefits of the Railroad Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.821" offset="9563220">And the Interstate Commerce Commission, resting its decision squarely and entirely within the framework of the federal statutes said that -- that Parmelee was not a carrier in and of itself subject to the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.828" offset="9651304">Therefore, its employees were not employees of a carrier subject to the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.215" offset="9676800">But that case is precisely what I was saying this morning, namely, that the activities of -- of Transfer are simply assimilated to the operations of the railroads specifically by 202 (c) (2), they are made railroad operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.057" offset="9760183">Now, however, I want to call your attention to other decisions of the Interstate Commerce Commission in respect to 202 (c) (2) of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.345" offset="9825280">In pick up of livestock in Illinois Island and Wisconsin and I'm -- I'm referring now briefly to some cases on pages 31 -- 21 to 23 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.605" offset="9870420">In pick up of livestock in Illinois Island and Wisconsin, the railroads filed tariffs providing for pick up of livestock within 10 miles of their stations that is they'd -- they'd go out and bring them in and load them in cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.872" offset="9935412">This was before the enactment of 202 (c).The -- that matter was brought before the Commission by a complaint of some motor carriers and the Commission said this that that was a motor carrier operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.126" offset="10000405">The railroad had no authority under Part 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.309" offset="10013153">It was not a railroad operation under Part 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.535" offset="10022139">Therefore, the railroads were ordered to cancel their tariffs and cease and desist from the operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.002" offset="10043977">After that, 202 (c) was enacted and the Commission reopened it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.569" offset="10066233">And then the Commission said the railroads now do not need any certificate under Part 2, 202 (c) has made it a railroad operation under part 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.662" offset="10106567">We will now approve the tariffs of the railroads providing for pick up of livestock by motor truck within 10 miles of their stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.309" offset="10137182">In other words, that shows by the construction of the Commission exactly the rights given by 202 (c) to the -- to the railroads that they are given in effect permanent certificates of public convenience and necessity to perform motor carrier operations, pick up and delivery and transfer in their terminal areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.699" offset="10238746">Now, in cartridge rail, the steamship lines at New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.982" offset="10267899">The railroads attempted to cancel tariffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.231" offset="10288901">The railroads had filed tariffs providing for pickup and delivery in inter-station service of freight in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.224" offset="10320875">The railroads attempted to cancel those tariffs and the Commission held in that case that it had jurisdiction to require performance of the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.614" offset="10358387">Now, any service that is performed under tariff and which the Commission has authority to require is a service that is, I submit, safe from any obstruction by state action, going again to another case of the Commission construing 202 (c), movement of highway trailers by rail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.541" offset="10474162">I'm sure you all take -- you've -- you've all read about it and take judicial notice of the fact that there is a tremendous railroad traffic growing up in what is so-called piggyback service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.304" offset="10521182">That is a trailer within a railroad terminal area that picks up freight.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.962" offset="10543752">The trailer is hauled to the railroad yard and loaded on a flat car, carried by the flat car to destination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.180" offset="10564650">The trailer unloads it and it's delivered to destination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.531" offset="10578024">In a -- an extensive hearing before the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Commission held that that entire operation is railroad service subject to Part 1 of the Act and that in order to perform that service, the railroads do not need any authority under Part 2 on account of Section 202 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.075" offset="10660258">Now, if cities all along the line can impose obstructions and require a showing of public convenience and necessity for the transfer of property and the persons in terminal areas, 202 (c) and the intention of Congress in respect to it is completely set at naught.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.620" offset="10742387">Now, I want to refer now to Castle against Hayes Freight Lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.574" offset="10770286">No, I -- I will first refer to Columbia Terminal's case and the Bradley against the Public Utilities Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.937" offset="10799647">Now, both of those cases are immediately differentiated in this respect that the Columbia Terminal's case was decided before the enactment of Section 202 (c) of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.013" offset="10867984">True enough, Columbia Terminals was performing inter-station pickup and delivery, but 202 (c) had not yet been enacted by the -- and that -- that is precisely the -- that the -- the District Court rested its decision on two grounds that there was no supersedure by the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.994" offset="10951889">The federal government hadn't -- hadn't entered the field, the pick up and delivery service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.833" offset="10975295">In Bradley against Public Utilities Commission, it again rested on the ground that the federal government had not entered the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.678" offset="11002671">Now, I want to go to Castle against Hayes Freight Lines because I think that case is directly in point here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.530" offset="11034018">Castle against Hayes Freight Lines involved an Illinois statute in which the State of Illinois in an attempt to avoid and abuse of its highways as the Court pointed out by overloading -- chronic overloading of motor trucks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.748" offset="11102981">The State passed an Act that a chronic overloader could be suspended from the use of the Illinois highways for 10 days for -- for three months and on the second offense prolonged.And this Court held that since Castle had a certificate from the Interstate Commerce Commission under which it was required to perform service and in as much as the Interstate Commerce Commission had the power to suspend that certificate that a power -- a -- an assertive power of suspension of Castle's rights in the state was violative of the Commerce Clause and the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.723" offset="11238818">You have precisely the same situation here because the railroads are vested with this right to perform the inter-station transfer service by Section 202 (c) (2) of the Interstate Commerce Act and there is this however this difference that did not appear in the Castle case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.360" offset="11325440">To the Hayes Freight Lines could file a cancellation of its schedules and could cease all operations in 30 days and the Interstate Commerce Commission or nobody else could do anything about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.649" offset="11382596">If the railroads filed a cancellation of their tariffs providing for the inter-station transfer of railroad passengers, the Commission under its own holdings, no Court has passed on this but the Commission has so held in the case I cite.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.748" offset="11438916">The Interstate Commerce Commission could compel the continuance of that inter-station transfer service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.273" offset="11465038">So in the Castle case, you held that a carrier who was not required, who was authorized, it's true to render service under the Interstate Commerce Act but was not required to do so could not be interfered with by the state on purely safety grounds, nothing but sheer police power grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.359" offset="11561378">But here, you have a case where the service -- the Commission as held can be compelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.229" offset="11588859">We can't quit if the Interstate Commerce Commission says we can't quit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.656" offset="11610593">Yet, the City of Chicago purports to say that it is going to say who shall -- who the railroad shall make a contract with.</text>

            <text syncTime="3383.575" offset="13534250">I want to go back to case of a venerable history namely the Pensacola Telegraph case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.858" offset="13563402">There, the State of Florida simply said “no telegraph company can come in to the state unless it has a license from the state.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.610" offset="13598407">And Congress, for the express purpose of avoiding that, provided for federal licenses for telegraph companies and this Court held that the Florida law couldn't keep the Western Union Telegraph out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.926" offset="13671654">Now as I say, the -- the question of who shall conduct Interstate Commerce is the important question in all of these cases from Gibbons against Ogden on down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.281" offset="13721078">I want to refer now to some couple of other federal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.947" offset="13759739">In 1866, Congress passed an Act that has been variously called the -- the "Railroad Communication Interchange Act of 1866."</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.582" offset="13802266">I set it out on page 26 in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.712" offset="13818776">Now, the legislative history of that Act shows that the State of New Jersey had provided by a New Jersey law had -- had granted an exclusive franchise to a certain railroad and said that no other railroad could operate between Philadelphia and New York, which of course are both outside of the State of New Jersey, unless the legislature of New Jersey agreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.622" offset="13966420">Congress passed the -- a law which says this and I think it's entirely applicable to this situation today, "Every railroad company in the United States is hereby authorized to carry upon and over its road and so forth, passengers on their way from any state to another state and to receive compensation therefore and to connect with roads of other states so as to form continuous lines for the transportation of the same to the place of destination."</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.571" offset="14102256">And this Court has construed that Act in a number of cases, in the Bowman against the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.240" offset="14140918">The Court said, these Acts referring to that another Act were passed under the power vested in Congress were designed to remove trammels upon transportation between different states which had previously existed and to prevent a creation of such trammels in the future and to facilitate railway transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.210" offset="14224823">In Union Pacific against Rock Island Railroad cited on page 30, the Court said, “It is impossible for us to ignore the great public policy in favor of continuous lines thus declared by Congress and that such it is in effectuation of that policy that such business arrangements as it will make such connections effective are made.”</text>

            <text syncTime="3598.266" offset="14393051">It's been frequently held that at least in some cases and I thought (Inaudible) that the mere fact that Congress has the power to regulate in the absence of regulation, the powers don't with the state (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.509" offset="14478002">And Mr. Kurland's argument, as I understood it, in reference to the statute was this, one argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.794" offset="14503079">That the statute does give the Commission power to regulate it under one, Part 1 of the Act as a carrier, although it's not a carrier but it gives that regulatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.346" offset="14549368">But they haven't made any effort to do it and therefore the power lines don't -- you can't claim that -- the city without a power by the state, without power to demand a certificate of convenience and necessity.</text>

            <text syncTime="3653.268" offset="14613002">Well, that argument is unsound on two bases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.991" offset="14627944">In the first place, the Congress has exercised the power here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.021" offset="14660023">In other words, if it were not for Section 202 (c) (2), the railroads could not conduct this inter-station transfer operation without a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the Commission under Part 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="3680.452" offset="14721776">But the Congress has given the railroads permanent motor carrier authority rights under Section 202 (c) (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="3694.641" offset="14778514">They -- they've given them just as effective rights as Hayes Freight Lines had so Congress has entered the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="3704.508" offset="14818011">The second answer to that is that assuming for purpose of argument that Congress has not entered the field, there is a very long line of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3716.733" offset="14866913">I cite them on Page 37 to the effect that no state or municipality can exercise its discretion as to whether it is going to permit the performance of Interstate Commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3739.920" offset="14959595">And under the cases, this Court in 140 years, the question of who is going to perform Interstate Commerce as between two rival candidates is a function that is forbidden to the states by the Commerce Clause so this Court has held.</text>
