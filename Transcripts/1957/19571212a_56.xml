            <text syncTime="1986.743" offset="7946971">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.361" offset="7977378">Going back to the jurisdictional question for one observation only, I should like to say that it seems to me that if these petitioners wanted to protect their rights by raising federal questions in the state courts they might well have done so by filing a petition to rehear which under the rules of the Court maybe filed within 15 days after the opinion is announced in any decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.906" offset="8091585">And it seems to me that otherwise we're on the same grounds when we say that a substantial federal question has not been raised that certainly we don't want to weigh that by going forward with these other questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.962" offset="8163788">But I do want to address the Court very briefly if I may on those subjects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.354" offset="8189388">Senator Atkins is always very persuasive and he raises the very interesting proposition of discrimination as between the various cases that have been decided by the Supreme Court of Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.025" offset="8252082">He says that -- first of all in the (Inaudible) case, our Court held that it was reversible error for a trial court to do what was done in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.494" offset="8309969">Now, our Court distinguished that proposition by saying that that error was coupled with other errors which required a reversal in the case and although they said it was error to do what was done in this instance that it would not be sufficient when standing alone to require a reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.965" offset="8399830">Now, I submit that that's purely a question of the state law that has been resolved by the state courts and certainly it's not a thing that this Court would look into.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.208" offset="8440790">Now, there are two propositions on which we say that this Court should dismiss the writ in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.740" offset="8482900">The first is that the state court opinion rest upon an adequate and independent non-federal ground, and that is that these petitioners, under the Tennessee constitution received a fair and impartial trial by a fair and impartial jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.135" offset="8560536">And our court has said over and over again that that satisfies the constitutional requirement in our State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.512" offset="8593972">Now, I take it that under the adjudicated cases, come into this Court or coming from this Court, that there could be no question whatever about the construction which the Supreme Court of Tennessee places upon its own constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="2177.657" offset="8710583">Yes, sir, and the rule is or the rule of evidence is this or in regard to the weight of the evidence that the weight of the evidence must preponderate against the verdict and in favor of the innocence of the accused before the court will reverse upon the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.781" offset="8787069">But now the factual situation was resolved aside and apart from these legal questions which were raised which were in regard to the confession and in regard to the jury question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.972" offset="8851853">And we take it that from the standpoint of the factual situation that there is no serious dispute as to the facts because counsel, as I understand it, representing the petitioners, conceives that the facts were cited by the Supreme Court of Tennessee are accurate in its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.060" offset="8932206">Now, the other proposition, it seems to me, that might be raised in the case is whether or not the action of the Supreme Court of Tennessee by saying that the error that occurred in the trial court was cured by its harmless error of the statute, violates the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.799" offset="9051115">Now, it has been argued that it violates the Fifth Amendment, the Sixth Amendment and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.038" offset="9080059">And certainly this Court has held repeatedly that under that Sixth Amendment, all that is raised there or protected there are federal rights and not state rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.940" offset="9123736">And it is also saying that in regard to the Fifth Amendment that the Fourteenth used the same protection that is supported under the Fifth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.564" offset="9182250">Therefore, I take it that the only possible question which could be raised would be in regard to the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.910" offset="9211611">Now, this Court has had before it the problem of construing statutes in regard to various classes of people from jury service in the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.235" offset="9256856">It's had before it the question of whether or not there can be a structure and a regular jury system coexisting in the same state where an unequal number of challenges are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.920" offset="9307638">It is has had the Blue Ribbon jury case before it from the State of New York, and then all of those cases this Court has concluded that so long that as a fair and impartial trial is afforded and accused by a fair and impartial jury that that is all that is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.318" offset="9389244">That substantially is what the Supreme Court of Tennessee held was required under the Constitution of Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.049" offset="9420173">Therefore, we submit that under those cases that which are mostly akin and by analogy are very similar to the proposition which we have here that they -- that control the question at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.759" offset="9486942">We respectfully submit, may it please the Court, that the case -- that writ should be dismissed and thank you very much.</text>

            <text syncTime="2443.270" offset="9773035">Now, we have a Court of Appeals which is an intermediate court in Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.996" offset="9791948">If there is a concurrent finding of fact by the Court of Appeals and the trial court, the Supreme Court of Tennessee is foreclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.196" offset="9832699">I'm looking into the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.518" offset="9841998">On the other hand, if there is a difference of opinion between the trial court and the Court of Appeals as to the meaning of those facts or what the facts actually were, the Court will look into.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.144" offset="9896542">And we get some very difficult situations as a result.</text>

            <text syncTime="2486.095" offset="9944294">May it please your -- gentlemen, the matter of rights was fully discoursed in the trial before the Supreme Court of our State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.025" offset="9996016">So they didn't spell it out in the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.267" offset="10008973">That is the basis, I think, without fear of contradiction, the basis on which they say in the opinion reported as I have previously indicated that it was an error that the court erred in this matter of excluding these 27 jurors because they were members of labor union, but that -- the harmless error statute would prevent a reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.838" offset="10131331">I think that is the factual picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.759" offset="10138958">There was no question in the Supreme Court opinion as I understood it but what it was an erroneous rule and it was error to have excluded these men for no other reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.792" offset="10207086">They were competent jurors before they are tendered, their bias, prejudice kinship, or ten or twelve reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.021" offset="10248046">Those were disposed of before the jury -- juror is tendered for jury service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.607" offset="10274377">Then after he is tendered as a qualified juror, that is when this withdrawal took place.</text>

            <text syncTime="2580.402" offset="10321607">I think it would sever a little purpose to start arguing that tonight.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.582" offset="10342296">We'd have to go over until after the first year anyway.</text>
