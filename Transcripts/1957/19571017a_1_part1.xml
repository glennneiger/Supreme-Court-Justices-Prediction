            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">United States of America versus the Shotwell Manufacturing Company, Byron A. Cain, Frank J. Huebner, et al., Number 1 on the docket.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.904" offset="79517">Mr. Elman.</text>

            <label>Mr. Philip Elman</label>
            <text syncTime="21.202" offset="84741">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.097" offset="116297">This case is here on certiorari the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit the writ being limited to the questions presented by a motion to remand which the Government has filed in this Court and by the answer made thereto by the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.727" offset="202815">This is a criminal tax evasion case in which the defendants, the respondents here were convicted after a trial lasting five weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.966" offset="243775">The record in the case is of formidable proportions covering some nine volumes and 5,000 pages of testimonies and exhibits.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.764" offset="282958">But nevertheless we believe that the only issue that's presented to Your Honors at this posture of the litigation is a very narrow one that it is essentially a question of judicial administration that does not call for any adjudication on the merits by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.522" offset="378044">Now, in broad outline, the case is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.223" offset="392882">The defendants were the Shotwell Manufacturing Company, the Chicago Illinois Corporation engaged in the manufacturing sale of candy and its three chief officers and stockholders, Cain, its President, Sullivan, its Executive Vice President and general counsel, and Huebner, its Vice President and general manager.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.846" offset="507298">The indictment returned in March 1952, charged them with willfully attempting to evade a large part of the corporations income taxes the years 1945 and 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.600" offset="578351">The unreported income alleged by the indictment consisting of almost a half million dollars in cash in the nature of so-called black-market payments which the company received from its customers in excess of the OPA ceiling prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.062" offset="664242">Now after the indictment was returned but before the trial, the defendants filed a motion to suppress certain evidence which they said they had turned over to the Government as part of a voluntary disclosure made in January 1948 in reliance of what was then the voluntary disclosure policy of the Department of the Treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.467" offset="789838">Now, at this point by way of background, I should describe briefly what that general policy was.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.263" offset="820976">It was first publicly announced in 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.611" offset="838426">It continued for about seven years until January 1952 when it was publicly abandoned and withdrawn by the then Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Schneider.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.825" offset="891298">It was never promulgated in the form of statute or regulations or any other such formal forms.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.657" offset="938527">The found expression gathered in press releases and speeches that were made by treasury officials during that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.171" offset="980637">And as described by these officials, the policy was intended to encourage delinquent taxpayers to come forward voluntarily in their own free will before any investigation have been begun by the Treasury, and to make a full disclosure of their liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.640" offset="1078544">And if that was done, if there were such a disclosure that was made in good faith disclosure that was sufficient, disclosure that was timely then the policy of the Treasury Department as it was stated was not to recommend criminal prosecution to the Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.911" offset="1171644">But in each of these pronouncements by the officials concerned always two elements were stressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.063" offset="1212186">First, the disclosure had to be a real disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.581" offset="1226292">It had to be intended to reveal information and not to conceal it.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.884" offset="1247504">It had to be made in good faith and it had to be a full disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.010" offset="1267984">The second requirement was that it would be timely that had come before the Treasury was on dissent of something wrong that come before the investigation and not after.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.023" offset="1323990">Now --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="331.159" stopTime="337.007">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="331.159" offset="1324617">How long that policy had been a disclosure policy?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="philip_elman" startTime="337.007" stopTime="418.899">
            <label>Mr. Philip Elman</label>
            <text syncTime="337.007" offset="1348023">It started in -- it was publicly announced as a policy in 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.621" offset="1370384">It was withdrawn in 19 -- early in 1952 for a period of about seven years.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.878" offset="1399432">We are not -- I would not wish the Court to understand that the Government is contending that because the policy was expressed in an informal way but that detracted in any way from its validity or from its significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.007" offset="1451990">It was the policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.131" offset="1460454">The fact, however, that it was expressed that way did detract from its -- from the clarity and the precision of the policy and there were considerable uncertainties and fuzziness as to just exactly when a disclosure was timely and when it was sufficient and those were the reasons which led Secretary Schneider in January 1952 to abandon the policy is unworthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.713" offset="1558779">Now, in this particular case, the Government opposed the motion to suppress.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.075" offset="1584274">It denied that there had been a voluntary disclosure that was sufficient and timely and made in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.617" offset="1622413">The factual issues does raise were canvassed by the district judge, Judge Nordbye sitting by special designation.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.646" offset="1670583">At a three-day hearing --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="418.899" stopTime="421.916">
            <label>Justice Charles E. Whittaker</label>
            <text syncTime="418.899" offset="1675494">Judge Nordbye from Minneapolis including in Chicago.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="philip_elman" startTime="421.916" stopTime="627.120">
            <label>Mr. Philip Elman</label>
            <text syncTime="421.916" offset="1687615">Judge Nordbye of Minnesota sat in this case by special designation of the then Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.623" offset="1718439">The issues at that hearing were issues as to which the defendants of course being the moving parties has the burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.075" offset="1760235">At the close of the hearing when all of the evidence was in, Judge Nordbye found that the motion to suppress should be denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.924" offset="1803598">Later he filed a memorandum setting forth in detail his findings of facts and his reasons for finding that this disclosure was not a disclosure at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.193" offset="1856679">It was made not in good faith for the purpose of revealing information but rather that it was made for the purpose of misinforming the government agent for the purpose of concealing information that was relevant in the computation of a tax liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.673" offset="1930658">That it was a fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.363" offset="1941420">Now, the defendant's version of the facts as set forth at the hearing was that they had disclosed the receipt of this -- of these black-market payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.223" offset="2008816">But however, that they had expended all that money to their suppliers from whom they could purchase raw materials only by paying over-ceiling prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.044" offset="2076108">And they had -- they said that these payments to their suppliers in effect cancelled out payments that they had received from their customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.217" offset="2124800">And that while on their returns they had reported neither the receipts nor the payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.788" offset="2155102">There was in effect a washout from the tax standpoint since as they claim as it's the law the payments were deductible.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.265" offset="2209019">However, they refused to reveal the names of the persons to whom these payments were made and Judge Nordbye found their story that they had turned over hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash to face this man which was the term given by the defendants in their testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.983" offset="2311837">He found that story completely unworthy of belief and on a basis of -- of the facts or in the basis of the evidence I've indicated plus the fact that as Judge Nordbye found not only that the defendants concealed information, refused to cooperate with the Treasury agency in giving information that was relevant in concluding that tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.789" offset="2407131">Beyond that, they had destroyed records which they had in the black-market transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.509" offset="2437956">They fabricated figures as to the amounts involved which they -- the figures which had been turned over to the Treasury agents where as Judge Nordbye found admittedly fictitious.</text>

            <text syncTime="627.120" offset="2508382">Mr. Elman, may I ask you that.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.195" offset="2524682">Were the records that were destroyed, those relating only to access prices over-ceiling prices paid for raw material or did those destroyed records also include the receipts by the taxpayer for over-ceiling prices for goods sold.</text>

            <text syncTime="656.868" offset="2627396">Now, I like to add further on this -- on the basis for Judge Nordbye's findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.214" offset="2660833">That he found a destruction of the records as to the black-market transactions in all aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.581" offset="2698240">He found that the story in the figures that were given were taken out of thin air, were wholly fictitious.</text>

            <label>Justice Charles E. Whittaker</label>
            <text syncTime="685.427" offset="2741708">As to receipts as well as to disbursements or just the letter?</text>

            <text syncTime="698.558" offset="2794162">I stand corrected I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.406" offset="2801580">It's just that this disbursements as to the hearing before Judge Nordbye, my recollection of the trial record was that the records covered both black-market purchases and the black-market with that of the sales.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="716.106" stopTime="767.551">
            <label>Justice Charles E. Whittaker</label>
            <text syncTime="716.106" offset="2864379">The reason I ask these questions is that I think this has some bearing upon the treatment given by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.931" offset="2919654">Isn't it true that when the taxpayer went to the bureau's agent the bureau's agent said, “We will not under our present policy allow offsetting claims for excess prices paid for raw material?”</text>
            <text syncTime="753.149" offset="3012545">And did not the taxpayer then say, “Well we litigate about that, we'll pay whatever taxes you -- on receipts we've had and then we will sue for refund on the remainder.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="philip_elman" startTime="767.551" stopTime="851.286">
            <label>Mr. Philip Elman</label>
            <text syncTime="767.551" offset="3070119">That's -- that is their -- that was their testimony sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.817" offset="3083180">But even on the basis of that version of the facts they were claiming a deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.261" offset="3112960">They were offering these alleged facts as a basis for they're not having paid any taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.687" offset="3154651">It was certainly the obligation of the revenue agents to determine whether these deductions that were being claimed had any substantial basis in facts, whether in fact this black-market money that came in to Shotwell has been dispersed as business expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.176" offset="3240647">It's part of the materials that entered into the manufacturing of the product which they've sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.645" offset="3266560">Now, I should add further to that that the defendant's story as told to the revenue agents was that all of the money that came in went out in precisely the same amounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.506" offset="3321940">So that therefore, in or -- if you were going to consider only the question of computing how much came in the Shotwell which is concededly gross income, since there was a parallel between that amount and the amount that went out, the revenue agents would have every justification for inquiring.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="851.286" stopTime="866.326">
            <label>Justice Charles E. Whittaker</label>
            <text syncTime="851.286" offset="3405113">But does not the Court of Appeals find out that the bureau at that time have not acquiesced the cases holding that excesses paid for raw materials over-ceiling prices was not deductible.</text>

          <turn speaker="philip_elman" startTime="866.326" stopTime="877.943">
            <label>Mr. Philip Elman</label>
            <text syncTime="866.326" offset="3465300">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.114" offset="3468434">That was then the Treasury's position that the issue was in litigation and ultimately the Treasury acquiesced in a possession taken by various Courts of Appeals that they were deductible.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="877.943" stopTime="914.252">
            <label>Justice Charles E. Whittaker</label>
            <text syncTime="877.943" offset="3511693">And that was the basis or one of the bases of the Court of Appeals in holding was it not, that a full disclosure had been made because the income of excess over ceiling prices had been disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.420" offset="3589642">And it was immaterial as to whether or not the excesses paid could be deducted because the taxpayer had said that they litigated about that question and meanwhile pay whatever the Government said was due.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.343" offset="3645336">Isn't that the basis of which the Court of Appeals acted?</text>

          <turn speaker="philip_elman" startTime="914.252" stopTime="974.584">
            <label>Mr. Philip Elman</label>
            <text syncTime="914.252" offset="3656934">The Court of Appeals did act on the basis that the information as to what Shotwell did with the black-market cash that came in was wholly irrelevant and the determination of the tax consequences of the receipt.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.589" offset="3718269">Now, there is -- the Government certainly takes issue on the law of the Court of Appeals but I don't think if it's necessary for this Court to go in to the merits of that but I do think I should point out that from the standpoint of the agents in 1948 when this alleged disclosure as on the defendant's version was made to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.567" offset="3814191">They certainly would have been wholly remiss in their duties if they had -- if they had accepted the defendant's statement that all these money went out and -- to persons who were unidentified in amounts that were admittedly fabricated.</text>

            <text syncTime="974.584" offset="3898305">Do that make any difference though if the taxpayer was willing to pay without regard to those deductions?</text>

            <label>Mr. Philip Elman</label>
            <text syncTime="982.878" offset="3931429">Well, the taxpayer's position was that he held no additional taxes at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.012" offset="3948042">When Shotwell's accountant and President Cain came in and as they said in January 1948, there's some dispute as to when that meeting took place, their story was not -- we have defrauded the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.013" offset="4008020">We are here to furnish you with amended tax returns and we are tendering additional payments of tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.063" offset="4044173">Their story was we failed to include in our tax returns some items of gross income amounting to several hundred thousand dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.200" offset="4084715">However, we don't know of any additional taxes because we also neglected to report in our returns that we paid out these hundreds of thousands of dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.165" offset="4128601">And for that reason, we don't owe you anything but we're just telling you this.</text>

            <text syncTime="1107.825" offset="4431203">But even if it did happened that way, certainly, a revenue agent who asked for information as these taxpayers were questionably asked at a later stage after this first meeting with the man named Sauber, he was the Chicago Field Deputy who, which I shall point out later, is now been indicted for a charge of conspiracy and perjury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.744" offset="4558890">But certainly, at a later stage, there was absolutely no question and the defendant so testified that they refused to give that information even when the Treasury agents asked for it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1229.982" offset="4919902">In any event (Voice Overlap) -- in any event, the Court of Appeals made a finding of fact on this record that Judge Nordbye was required on the evidence presented to him to conclude that the disclosure was valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.653" offset="4982596">And beyond that, the Court of Appeals found affirmatively that the disclosure was timely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.608" offset="5006420">Judge Nordbye had refrained from making any finding as the timeliness of the disclosure as to when the investigation has began because on his view there never was a disclosure at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.803" offset="5047171">But the Court of Appeals affirmatively made such a finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.664" offset="5058560">The Government's petition for certiorari considering that in this case there had been a departure from the established standards governing appellate review of factual determinations in such a degree as to why they're invoking these supervisory powers of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.280" offset="5133061">That was on October, 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.111" offset="5144346">Within a period of about six weeks, they began to develop a sequence of events that did not detracted from the unusual character of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.414" offset="5197636">The matters have been brought to the attention of this Court and they form the basis of the submission which the Government is making here that the case should not be decided on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.176" offset="5248627">The Government's request for review of the case on this record should not be accepted at this time but rather that in the broad interest of justice in the interest of judicial administration, the case should be remanded to the District Court for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.469" offset="5345802">Now what are these new matters upon the basis of which this unusual request is made?</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.981" offset="5383837">It was called to the Court's attention that beginning -- that some time in the middle of 1955 while this case was pending in the Court of Appeals, they began to be entertained in the minds of some officials of the Internal Revenue Service in Washington, suspicion as to the regularity or irregularity in handling of tax cases in the Chicago field office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.461" offset="5513822">That as a result of those suspicions, a full scale investigation was initiated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.367" offset="5541407">On December 1st, 1955, the Department of Justice was informed by the Chief Counsel of the Internal Revenue Service that that investigation has gone forward sufficiently to justify the conclusion that there -- that in the record of the Shotwell case, this case, there were false, perjurious statements that were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.496" offset="5653943">On the basis of that representation, the Solicitor General asked this Court the preferred consideration of its -- of the Government's petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.653" offset="5686544">And thereafter, the motion to remand which is the basis of -- which is before Your Honors in this argument was -- was filed in October of last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.345" offset="5741296">Now, the investigation initiated by the Internal Revenue Service led to a grand jury inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.115" offset="5780376">The grand jury inquired into the question of whether in the trial of this case there had been perjury, bribery, corruption, fraud, obstruction of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.650" offset="5842547">As the result of its inquiry, the grand jury in February of this year has returned an indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.435" offset="5873685">The defendants named in the indictment are the Shotwell Company, Cain, one of the defendants, one of the respondents here, Sullivan, and two agents of the Internal Revenue Service, one of them being Sauber who is the man to whom this alleged disclosure in January 1948 was supposed to have been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.948" offset="5987788">The conspiracy is in ten counts.</text>
