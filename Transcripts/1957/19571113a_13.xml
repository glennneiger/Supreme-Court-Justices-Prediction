            <label>Mr. Douglas F. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="16.233" offset="64888">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.188" offset="68650">To recapitulate for just a moment, I should like to emphasize that in our view, the question here is essentially one of fact not of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.154" offset="128522">We say that on the facts here, the question posed by the Court on certiorari is not presented, it's not presented by the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.402" offset="177528">Petitioner cites a number of decisions by distinguished courts and judges which hold as -- he stated in one quite graphically that the Court does not have jurisdiction to deal with non-diverse interveners in a case in which the claims are simply a conjury of separate claims involving only common questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.892" offset="343562">We don't find it necessary to deal with those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.130" offset="364460">They do not relate to the facts of the case before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.759" offset="382955">They're germane to the argument that Brother Acheson has with Professor Moore which is an interesting question but it's an academic one in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.902" offset="427572">On the other hand, we rely on many cases in which this Court and other federal courts have held that if the claims are interdependent claims to funds of which the federal court has taken control, that then jurisdiction exists to make a full disposition of that property subject to the control of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.224" offset="560797">Petitioner purports not to question these decisions naturally.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.413" offset="589636">He says yes but in those cases, there were -- there were really funds there.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.701" offset="614713">Well, let's see about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.517" offset="625998">In the leading case of Stewart versus Dunham, decision of this Court, there was an equitable trust imposed upon money in the hands of the fraudulent transferee.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.934" offset="699664">It wasn't locked in the Court's safe or in the physical possession of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.697" offset="722756">It was -- it was just money in the hands of the fraudulent transferee.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.949" offset="747729">Let's look at Hanley versus (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="189.739" offset="758909">There, there wasn't any money in possession of the Court in the literal sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.909" offset="779598">It was money in the hands of stockholders who hadn't paid for their stock subscriptions and the creditor is one to get to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.079" offset="808229">And the Court impressed a constructive trust on it and then heard the property, was property in the assets of an insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.629" offset="846472">And in Dickinson versus Burnham, there is a case that's particularly an uncomfortable one from my friend.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.127" offset="876460">It was decided by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals fairly recently.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.344" offset="897358">There, there had been money collected for a corporate purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.765" offset="918988">But as the District Court said in that case, the case was not one to collect from a trustee of that money that had been collected, the trustee wasn't in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.634" offset="978442">It was not a case to reinstate a trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.224" offset="992862">If you please, it was precisely the situation we have here, the Court impressed a constructive trust upon unjust enrichment that came into the hands of a fraud feasor, exactly the situation we have here and the Court said that there were independent claims in an order fully to distribute the fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.007" offset="1083977">It should be done by one court.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.018" offset="1100069">And he took -- he took jurisdiction of non-diverse interveners and this Court denied certiorari.</text>

            <label>Mr. Douglas F. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="302.681" offset="1210723">So, they can't do much with this fund distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.984" offset="1239876">And so finally and belatedly and in the fourth brief, they filed in this Court, they come to the reality of dealing with the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.996" offset="1279896">And I've put together some of these sentences and that's where I left off when the Court rose yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.251" offset="1304973">In which they say, the total number of validly issued shares at liquidation is a fact to be determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.942" offset="1339768">In determining the fact from the proof, a court must decide the number of validly issued shares at the time of liquidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.985" offset="1379892">Mark this please, “Facts that go beyond an individual plaintiff's interests must be considered in working out the amount of recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.158" offset="1420539">Here, the amount per share to which he is entitled.”</text>
            <text syncTime="358.738" offset="1434854">Now, I earnestly ask the Court to compare that admission, that in order to decide this case, the Court's got to know how much everybody else is entitled to with this statement upon which they -- by which they induced this Court to grant certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.730" offset="1530880">Just please compare what I've read in the reply brief with his statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.784" offset="1551047">“The Court of Appeals formula," and I'm quoting, "produces the same fixed absolute amount to each claimant regardless of the number of claimants.”</text>
            <text syncTime="399.948" offset="1599739">That's the -- that's the representation upon which you granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.464" offset="1617816">Now, for the first time in their reply brief, they come to face with the reality, namely the intensely practical fact that the amount that every person gets out of this fund on which the courts impressed the constructive trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.184" offset="1704647">The -- everybody's claim is for more or fewer dollars depending upon the merits of the claim of every other individual who stopped was arbitrarily retired.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.664" offset="1774655">For the first time, they have conceded in their reply brief that the actual, factual interdependence here makes it necessary to determine on the evidence as to each of these claims whether the individual parted with his stock through fraud and the amount of his claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.734" offset="1866919">They concede in the part I've read to the Court that they -- you have to do that in order to determine how much the plaintiffs are entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.783" offset="1907043">Now, let's see what this means further.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.283" offset="1917074">It means that after the Court has determined the precise amount of the unjust enrichment and determined exactly the amount that all the victims of this fraud are entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.809" offset="1979141">That then, the Court can't distribute that unjust enrichment of which he's taking control, but he's got to the people that have been shown by this evidence that they say is necessary to be entitled to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.062" offset="2024176">He can't distribute this fund of which he's taking control.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.365" offset="2037447">But he's got to turn back to the trustee ex maleficio.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.534" offset="2054060">He's got to turn back to Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.821" offset="2063256">That part of this fund which has been shown to be due to the non-diverse interveners.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.394" offset="2101499">Well now, in this case for example, what that means is that you've got to determine from the evidence of Mr. and Mrs. Constant whether they parted with their shares through fraud and how much they are entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.581" offset="2166282">You've got to do that, they say, in order to determine what the plaintiff is entitled to, but after you have determined what the Constants are entitled to, then they say, "The Court must turn them out of court because they're non-diverse and it can't give them their established part of this fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.921" offset="2243605">Professor (Inaudible), one time, characterized the type of cases in which federal courts exercise ancillary jurisdiction over non-diverse people.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.454" offset="2301806">I say in that non-diverse people are permitted to come in order to dispose of the property of which the Court has taken jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.460" offset="2345796">And that he says it's like dividing up a pie.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.625" offset="2362410">He says you've got to count the people around the table.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.501" offset="2377979">You've got to know who's there before you cut the pie, before you know how many pieces there are.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.625" offset="2402429">Well, my friend on the other side goes partway.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.581" offset="2422282">They -- they have to count the Constants.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.030" offset="2432104">They have to count the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.368" offset="2437433">They have to find out about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.919" offset="2447673">But after the pie has been cut, then the Constants are turned away from the table, they are not permitted to get their pieces of the pie.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.781" offset="2483096">But those pieces of the pie are turned back to the fraud feasor out of this property of which the Court has taken jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.747" offset="2522906">Now, we submit that what this contention adds up to is a brand new contention in this lawsuit that federal courts just don't have after all -- federal courts don't have the jurisdiction they have exercised from the beginning of the Court to deal with non-diverse interveners in order to adjudicate interdependent rights to property on which the Court has impressed a constructive trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.447" offset="2669714">The petition here was aimed primarily and naturally so at the substantive judgment alone, the judgment holding Black guilty of fraud and require him account for his unjust enrichment.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.246" offset="2740976">But the Court denied certiorari on the merits of that substantive judgment and left Black only with this narrow jurisdictional point.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.796" offset="2795102">The jurisdictional point is so self-limiting that Black has found that an extremely poor substitute for the review on the merits which he sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.522" offset="2850064">The jurisdictional point involving the Constants is a self-limiting point because the very heart of the contention on which it rest is that the claims of the Constants are wholly separate and distinct from those of every other party.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.036" offset="2944104">So, if we accept completely here and I think my friend on the other side conceded this in a question from Justice Black or Justice Douglas, its -- if we accept fully the proposition that the Court's question was correctly posed on the facts which we say it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.462" offset="3041802">And if we concede arguendo that non-diverse parties should not be permitted in this case, concede everything that petitioner is entitled to argue under the limited grant of certiorari that we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.960" offset="3123827">What we come to is the proposition, that two parties, the Constants were non-diverse, were permitted to intervene here and ought to be dismissed out of this case without questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.191" offset="3172728">Well now, that would be most unfortunate for the Constants.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.248" offset="3196970">We've devoted our entire defense here substantially to showing that it would be an unjust and improper result.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.682" offset="3238661">But at the same time, its very poor comfort for Mr. Black, and so he asks an opportunity to perform a very delicate operation which he didn't really elaborate here in argument as he did in his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.041" offset="3320163">The judgment against the Constants would -- the dropping out of the Constants would reduce the judgment only insignificant.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.267" offset="3357048">And so Black has deemed it to be utterly essential to find some basis on which he could defeat the participation of the other plaintiffs as well as the Constants.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.055" offset="3400202">And since the majority of the other parties are residents of Illinois, the expedient which he has adopted is an effort to destroy the diversity of the Illinois people.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.976" offset="3463837">And here's where the delicate operation comes in.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.499" offset="3481913">He sees as his vehicle on Black Marshall Oil Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.392" offset="3509499">He wants the Black Marshall Oil Company to be held to be a necessary party in order to destroy the diversity that exist between the bulk of the plaintiffs and Black Marshall.</text>

            <text syncTime="922.542" offset="3690162">Well, now the sufficient reason why that didn't work has been observed by Justice Douglas.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.069" offset="3720255">The Court did not take jurisdiction of that question, did not grant certiorari as to that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.776" offset="3751079">The Court of Appeals held that there was no equity in the corporate claim because the money would go to N.C.R.A., the purchaser which had gotten full value for what it paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.874" offset="3799458">But the Court held that Black equity would not permit Black to participate in the proceeds of this sale in respect to this 32,000 shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.391" offset="3849509">That contention was vigorously attacked in this Court on the petition for certiorari by the petitioner asserting that the wrong resulted not to the stockholders but to the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.697" offset="3918785">The Court denied certiorari on that issue, not withstanding that denial and limitation on certiorari in a desperate effort to defeat the participation of this Illinois people.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.486" offset="3969881">They simply reargue all over again that question and what they asked is a remand to the District Court that will broad enough to enable them to argue that question to the District Court, and thus, achieve the same result as if they have gotten a certiorari on the merits which was denied, and then gotten the substantive judgment set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.154" offset="4060578">Now, I -- I come to this action of the Court of Appeals, Mr. Justice Frankfurter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.728" offset="4090880">I want to say first and correct a misstatement of my brother Acheson on the opening, in which he said twice that it was a divided court that reversed, it was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.784" offset="4135079">It was a unanimous court with reference to the basic fraud that Black had committed wholly and that he must account for his unjust enrichment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.489" offset="4169874">One judge dissented on some technical grounds with reference to the corporation and the 32,000 shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.787" offset="4203102">Now, to avoid coming to grips with the facts, as the interdependence here, they relied throughout three of their briefs on what the Circuit Court of Appeals had done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.770" offset="4255033">They rely upon the circumstance that in a different context and in reply to a different argument, the Court of Appeals had said that these questions involved this claim, this suit involves common questions of law and fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.353" offset="4317309">As of course most obviously it does, and that it does met the requirements of spurious class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.591" offset="4346358">Now, let's see, if you please, what contention the Court was responding to and what significance that has if any in relation to the question under discussion here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.252" offset="4388989">Petitioner's position in the Court of Appeals was exactly the opposite of their position here.They said there that these claims didn't present common questions of law and fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.033" offset="4432039">They didn't present common questions of law and fact because they said that the fraud had been separately committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.167" offset="4456594">They said it wasn't a spurious class action and for that reason -- for that reason because it wasn't a spurious class action, the Court couldn't hear non-diverse interveners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.763" offset="4502988">Well, they -- they made their assertion that these claims didn't present common questions of law and fact, Mr. Justice, on the theory that they had been separately committed not by one prospectus or at one meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.355" offset="4557322">The Court of Appeals responding to that held that the fraudulent representations were made in pursuance of a definite plan to eliminate a large family of stockholders, I'm quoting, “and that the testimony indisputably shows the general pattern of action.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.979" offset="4619912">And so, he said that the claims do present common questions of law and fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.178" offset="4636630">Now, that was the only question before the Court on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.549" offset="4654184">It had no occasion whatever to find out or to say whether in addition to presenting common questions of law and fact which of course they do, they were also interdependent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.365" offset="4697443">With the Court's formula, you will find when you study it, does recognize the interdependence of the claims and makes provision for it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1393.182" offset="5572650">My learned -- learned friend's argument, I think, brings out forcefully the tyranny of words.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.863" offset="5595429">I'm not clear whether his -- the victim or whether he's using words as an ally to impose their tyranny on us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.161" offset="5624581">Here, the tyrannical word is “fund".</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.298" offset="5641091">He accuses me of believing, which would certainly be a naïve thing for a lawyer to believe, that there is no fund unless there is some money locked up in the safe in the clerk's office, of course, I have no such fantastic idea as that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.409" offset="5701590">The term “common fund” and he always keeps dropping off the important word “common".</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.706" offset="5722802">The term “common fund” as it's used in the law means a definite sum of money in which people have rights, usually the rights exceeding the amount of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.502" offset="5769927">The amount of money is before the Court either because the person who owns it as before the Court or because it is paid in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.289" offset="5797094">Let's figure all about it's being paid in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.414" offset="5809633">In the Dickinson case which is his favorite case and it is my favorite case also because it brings out very clearly what this case is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.637" offset="5846518">In the Dickinson case, the fund was a 106 -- $176,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.873" offset="5867416">It was not in Court, of course, it wasn't in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.581" offset="5878282">It was owned by two men who had stolen it and the subscribers to the original fund of $600,000 said, "We have a pro rata interest in that fund."</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.768" offset="5923004">And the Court said, “You have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.912" offset="5931572">We now decide that this fund was improperly taken by these two men.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.091" offset="5948291">All of you who put up the original $600,000 have got a pro rata interest and you may all come in and get your interest."</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.695" offset="5982772">But the way my learned friend uses the term “fund”, it means the sum of all the separate demands of all the separate plaintiffs in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.970" offset="6019866">He uses -- it would be a fund in his sense of the word if I ran down an automobile -- with my automobile, it went down a loading platform on which 50 people were standing and heard all of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.058" offset="6068140">If they all sued me that some total of their claims would be, in his view, a fund, because they all have claims against me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.040" offset="6100114">It all has -- came out of a common transaction, their common questions of law involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.691" offset="6118713">Therefore, it's a fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.209" offset="6124774">Any one person on the loading platform had diversity of citizenship with me, then according to his argument, they could all come into a federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.971" offset="6163853">But then he keeps talking about a trust fund, the Court impressed a trust on a fund, or what did the Court impress anything on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.678" offset="6198648">It isn't a fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.009" offset="6203977">If there's any fund at all and this -- these words of trust are merely used to describe the nature of the recovery, not a sum of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.060" offset="6240235">He can't tell you what sum of money is in this fund, he doesn't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.374" offset="6257476">Nobody will know until the individual recoveries are added up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.569" offset="6278269">There isn't a trust imposed on something.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.878" offset="6291435">In the language of the Court, there are all kinds of trust that as -- as many trusts as there are defendants, but they are separate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.809" offset="6315154">The point is not to be confused with the word “fund".</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.251" offset="6328947">There's nothing common about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.045" offset="6336157">Each plaintiff has his own separate recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.292" offset="6353084">That -- and that again is brought out very clearly in cases like Ayer versus Kemper and Miller versus the National -- the National City which I talked about yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.824" offset="6395193">Then that brings me to the second part of -- of -- second point I want to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.364" offset="6421420">Counsel was asked, what is the basis of the Court of Appeals decision?</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.975" offset="6439811">It's an unjust enrichment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.515" offset="6445976">That is the basis of their decision and why was it the basis?</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.381" offset="6461440">Because there is a finding of fact which is concurred in by all four judges who heard this case and by counsel, he can't say one single word against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.098" offset="6500310">And that is that Black paid these people, the full value of their stock when they bought it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.789" offset="6523089">Absolutely down to the last cent of the full value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.850" offset="6535314">Therefore, they have no cause of action for in fraud or in tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.569" offset="6550256">So, what did they do?</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.129" offset="6556421">They say, "Well, there's a trust on this."</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.241" offset="6564885">There was misrepresentation here and therefore, you hold each one of these blocks of stock, entrust for its owner until the corporation is dissolved, and then you pay him out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.595" offset="6614309">Now, two things come out of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.733" offset="6622877">One of them is, if there is not a common trust but even on the language of -- of the Court, there is a specific trust imposed on each block of stock for each owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.726" offset="6670838">And the second thing that comes out of it that I want to stress is over and over and over again where we have been arguing here, my friend has been arguing here as though you hadn't granted certiorari on the first point, as though we were attacking or -- or defending the Court of Appeals in overruling the decision of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.522" offset="6746070">The District Court found there was no fraud at all, not a different fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.106" offset="6764356">When we come to the Court of Appeals, my friend says there was not a dividend court on this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.285" offset="6789120">There was divided court on this question, a proof of this comes from reading the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.830" offset="6807301">What the Judge Phillips decide on this question?</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.854" offset="6819318">He decided that the man who made the misrepresentations, made it within the scope of -- of an agency which Black had given him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.419" offset="6853590">He did not find.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.575" offset="6858292">In fact, he specifically found the other way that Black was not responsible for what this man said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.284" offset="6881071">Therefore, we have two judges, the judge who heard the case, the Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals who said this man is not guilty of any fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.640" offset="6914508">But Judge Phillips joins with the others and say, "We must hold him liable for somebody else's fraud because he comes within -- it came within the scope of an agency given to him."</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.038" offset="6956095">The other two judges of course go further and -- and say the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.435" offset="6973649">But in impressing all of this evidence when they talk about fraud on this Court, please remember that out of the four judges who heard it, the judge who heard the testimony did not believe it and either did the Chief Judge in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.690" offset="7046687">One last word.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.152" offset="7064555">We're talking -- keep talking, my brother does about the federal question which is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.677" offset="7086707">I went over it yesterday to show you that this federal question had never been mentioned in any proceeding, in any argument, in any evidence, in any brief filed throughout the entire length of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.279" offset="7141042">And my brother said that the Court of Appeals opinion if fairly read would read on this federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.033" offset="7168104">The Court of Appeals didn't have the remotest idea that anyone dreamed that there was a federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.248" offset="7188898">It wasn't mentioned to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.677" offset="7194645">It wasn't in the record when -- which went up to it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1855.132" offset="7420447">Every one of those single decisions says that, if you have not litigated the case or put it the other way, that in all those cases, the federal statute was the center of the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.327" offset="7469244">A testimony was taken on it, briefs were written about it, arguments were made upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.757" offset="7494949">Any of the cases, the lower court dismissed the federal question and said, "No, we don't think it is involved on the Court."</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.077" offset="7520235">And when they went up to the Court of Appeals, they said, "Certainly, we think it's involved, it was the center of this case."</text>

            <text syncTime="2020.048" offset="8080091">Because if you read that prayer in the complaints, you will see that each one of these interveners and stockholders asks to be restored to his right as a stockholder of a corporation to be given back his stock, to be allowed to participate in the liquidating dividend of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.664" offset="8150622">And we say the corporation of course is a necessary party.</text>

            <text syncTime="2045.511" offset="8181969">Because they appointed receivers for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.496" offset="8193881">The receivers came in as party's plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.391" offset="8205479">They asked for the dismissal of the corporation and the corporation was dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.367" offset="8221466">Now, we say that the Court of Appeals dismissed the receivers out of the case, said they have no standing to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.338" offset="8249260">It was -- it'd be inequitable to allow them to recover.</text>
