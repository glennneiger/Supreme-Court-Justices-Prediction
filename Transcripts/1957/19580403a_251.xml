            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">Mr. Solicitor General you may proceed with your argument.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="9.591" stopTime="367.346">
            <label>Mr. J. Lee Rankin</label>
            <text syncTime="9.591" offset="38348">In regard to the last question that was asked me about the judgment of the Court, I'd like to make it clear first that the Court of Appeals sustained the motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.923" offset="91638">That question was not supposed to be before the Court at all, because the lower court expressly stayed that question and examined into only the question of whether the court had jurisdiction to act in this manner at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.112" offset="164362">But in spite of that and in spite of the fact the government was advised by the lower court that we would have a full opportunity to answer the some 60 pages of the affidavits and over 500 pages of Congressional record and materials that were presented under the summary, motion for summary judgment, the Court of Appeals proceeded to decide the case on its merits and it then proceeded after that as you will note by the opinion to examine into the question of jurisdiction and pass on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.133" offset="292467">Now the court sustained the motion for summary judgment, except that it did not permit any refund of the tolls that had been paid or reparations, and the detail of the prayer, of the motion for summary judgment appears on page 11 of the record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.568" offset="378253">And it is of particular interest, I'd like to call your attention to certain parts of it, because in paragraph one, the motion is that the defendant be directed to proceed, to prescribe tolls as provided in the statute, to propose changes in the tolls and to conduct a public hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.903" offset="535510">Then the second paragraph is enjoining and restraining the defendant from further unlawful withholding and unreasonably delaying the prescription of tolls, proposal of changes in the conduct of a public hearing and then the third paragraph commands and directs us which is mandatory, a mandamus or a mandatory injunction and it's the position of the government that this Court and other federal courts outside of the District of Columbia, except for action that's ancillary to their jurisdiction, do not have the power to grant relief of that character unless the statutes expressly so provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.790" offset="655151">But regardless of that, we're directed expressly, commanding and directing and then the next one is enjoining and restraining us from using any account, that are less favorable than the Comptroller General use and the fifth one is retaining jurisdiction, so as to issue appropriate orders that the defendant prescribe tolls and proposed changes in tolls and conduct a public hearing according to law.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.108" offset="760372">Now if you will refer to page 167 of our brief and about two-thirds of the way down, there is provided further and that is the language of the statute, 167 that says what we we're to do about changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.583" offset="866325">Just ahead of that is the first proviso that says that we can maintain the prevailing rate and the measurement in effect on that date, shall continue in effect until changed as provided in this section.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.723" offset="934870">That's the power that we rely on to continue the $0.90 rate that now is continued in effect if the petitioner finds that it is profit, and that the Congress so contemplated.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.093" offset="988369">Then we turn to the next proviso and it says that the Fed Corporation shall give six months notice, what kind of a notice is it?</text>
            <text syncTime="255.511" offset="1022015">What is it going to give notice of?</text>
            <text syncTime="257.559" offset="1030165">By publication in the Federal Register of any and all proposed changes in basic rules of measurement and of any and all proposed changes in rates of tolls, so that until we decide, the petitioner decides at least and possibly the President too or at least the petitioner must decide, that there has to be a change.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.740" offset="1138939">We can't have any hearing because that's the construction of a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.989" offset="1159941">The statute contemplates that the petitioner has to first decide that there is to be a change in the tolls.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.097" offset="1188362">Then it publishes it for six months in the Federal Register, and there after it proceeds to have hearings during that six-month period and those hearings are not administrative hearings during which you make a record for review of a court like in the ordinary regulatory agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.297" offset="1265162">They are legislative hearings just like the provision that was in effect before, when the President had the power to fix the tolls.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.161" offset="1308630">So if we don't start first to decide that there has to be a change in these tolls, there is no requirement for a hearing and none is contemplated, because there is no purpose for it and then it's only a legislative hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.899" offset="1367562">Now that's clearly what the statutes contemplated and all that it provides and we are directed mandatorily to proceed to decide that there must be a change when we have decided that there need not be one and then proceed with hearings when we decided that there is no need for a change, therefore the statute doesn't provide for a hearing and that's the character of relief that was given.</text>

            <text syncTime="427.675" offset="1710602">Suppose this Court affirmed the Court of Appeals, suppose it was to affirm it without an opinion to infer, and then the Panama Canal Company says here we've got an order of the Court, an order of the Supreme Court, and we go the Court of Appeals to figure, to find out what it is, that it contemplated and they say that we think, the rates that we fixed, the existing rates are within the scope and the authority in the act of Congress, but we are an obedient agency and we'll do the best we can on the basis of what we deem to be false assumptions in fact, to change the tolls.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.293" offset="1881130">The matter then goes to the President, he says they are all wrong and he disallows the changed tolls, he says the old tolls shall remain in force.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.116" offset="1916447">I would like to hear from both sides whether that determination by the President is then reviewable by any court, so that we go around and get the same result by the Presidential action?</text>

            <text syncTime="583.857" offset="2335347">Our position is that insofar as compulsion is concerned the question of Presidential review, that is to say a judicial review of Presidential action is not yet before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.872" offset="2379442">At the present time we're merely trying to compel action on that phase of the case and for instance in Chicago and Southern Air Lines against Waterman which is a case upon which my learned friend relies, where it was held the President's action was not reviewable nevertheless the law indicates that if the Civil Aeronautics Board which was the subordinate agency in that case had simply sat on a proceeding for something like seven years and taken no action, the courts would have had power to compel it to act to move along, as for instance in Virginia Railway against System Federation or Wilbur against Krushnic or Interstate Commerce Commission against Humboldt Steam Ship Company or in Payne against New Mexico all of which are cases where the subordinate agency had filed to act or failed to act in accordance with a correct construction of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.069" offset="2580271">And the courts compel the subordinate agency to act in accordance with a correct construction of the statute although the court had no power to review the action when taken.</text>

            <text syncTime="1139.948" offset="4559726">The reason there is a tremendous increase in traffic through the canal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.376" offset="4577489">The traffic has increased from 20 odd million tons to 40 million odd tons or 20 million odd tons in 1947 the last year before the agitation that resulted the act of September 26th 1950 and 1957 which was last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.245" offset="4640914">Defendant -- tolls and toll credits amounted to 90 million odd in 1947 and amounted to 39 million odd in 1957 representing an increase in traffic as I say from approximately 20 million odd tons to 40 million odd tons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.445" offset="4697757">Now the defendant operates on pretty much fixed cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.819" offset="4711236">It cost very little (Inaudible) 20 ships a day through the canal and to get only 10 and the direct expense of operating the canal has gone from only 14 million odd dollars, to 16 million odd dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.311" offset="4761182">So that on a per tonnage basis, the cost, the cost per ton of getting a ship through the canal or getting a ton through the canal has very much decreased.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.188" offset="4808725">Now the act of September 26, 1950, relates tolls to cost and the cost per ton, having gone down so much, we say that tolls also should go down, and in fact there has been the same increase at Suez and at Suez rates have been reduced to 40% in the post war period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.645" offset="4902557">The defendant in his brief relates this situation somehow to Suez and yet the fact is that if rates here were reduced by the full 0.25 cents a ton, indicated by the Comptroller General's report, rates at Panama would still be higher, relative to Suez rates than they were either in 1937, when the present Panama rate was fixed or in 1948, when the legislative process, legislative history of this act began.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.347" offset="5009345">Now my first proposition is that long ago it came to duty of this defendant to prescribe reduce tolls and I say that because the statute compels, directs this defendant to prescribe tolls on the basis of canal activity and without regard to the losses of the so called business activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.727" offset="5094818">Now if I am correct in that construction of the statute, then the Comptroller General's report establishes beyond all doubt, that on a canal activity basis, the present rate is far excessive, that collections under this rate far exceed the cost prescribed or defined in the tolls formulated laid down by Act of September 26th.</text>

            <text syncTime="1562.652" offset="6250580">No there was not Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.754" offset="6258939">But I -- although the defendant here has written a long brief and has got into a -- gone into the bookkeeping to a considerable extent, I do not, I maybe mistaken, but I do not understand that the Comptroller General's analysis is challenged once it be assumed that the defendant was required by the statute to prescribe tolls on the basis of the canal activity and without regard to the losses of the business activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.328" offset="6401254">Mr. Rankin can correct me if I'm mistaken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.308" offset="6409195">I find nothing in the brief which challenges the Comptroller General's analysis as a correct analysis upon that assumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.501" offset="6473979">Now our reason is the same that the Act of September 26, 1950, directed that tolls be prescribed on the basis of the canal activity and not -- and without regard to the losses of the business activities are as I say the language of the statute, the legislative history and defendants own admissions, and let me first take up the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.411" offset="6593620">The Act of September 26, 1950 can be understood only in the light of the situation as it existed at that time, because that Act was passed to deal with a particular situation, as I suppose all statutes are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.810" offset="6651193">Now in 1948 the canal authorities proposed an increased toll.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.916" offset="6687660">Now at that time the toll was $0.90 a laden ton, having been so fixed by the President in 1937, pursuant to the Act of that August 24, 1937 which authorized the President to fix tolls at not less than $0.75 and not more than $1 per laden ton.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.380" offset="6773447">The Panama Canal, the waterway itself was being operated by an unincorporated agency called The Panama Canal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.258" offset="6808973">The Panama Canal also conducted the local government in the canal zone and it further conducted certain business operations such as a shipyard, a printing press and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.243" offset="6860904">Now this is a key feature in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.759" offset="6878981">The cost of the canal zone government was a great deal more than it otherwise would be, because of the presence of armed forces, large units of the armed forces in the canal zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.612" offset="6918374">As Your Honors are undoubtedly aware, the canal zone is not only the site of a canal, but it is also a very important military base, and more than half the population of the zone consists of the armed forces and their dependants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.480" offset="6981904">Now the cost to the government, the canal zone government was a great deal more than it otherwise would have been, because of the presence of these troops and their dependants, more schools were necessary, more hospitals were necessary, more police, larger highways, more highway maintenance and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.903" offset="7047523">Now a third feature was that at that time the Panama Railroad Company, defendant or it's predecessor was operating other business activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.369" offset="7081378">The railroad, the shipping line, commissaries, these other business activities had been profitable for many years, and they paid large sums in dividends to the United States Treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.869" offset="7127458">These business activities served the canal as such and also the armed forces and also the Republic of Panama and the public generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.960" offset="7191824">And a fourth feature, although perhaps only a detail but an important detail is that defendants reports were on an activity basis, that is to say the defendants in its budget program submitted to Congress and its Annual Reports, broke down each activity according to net results after the allocation of general expense, so anyone looking at these reports could tell the final result, financial result of that particular activity considering all factors including general expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.505" offset="7329959">Now, when the canal authorities proposed this increase, the shipping industry protested on this ground that the additional cost, the higher cost which were the justification for the proposed increase were higher governmental cost, military cost, commercial cost and not higher cost of ship transits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.860" offset="7415432">Now Congress recognized force to that objection and after three years of consideration by the Bureau of the Budget and various congressional committees, the Court of Appeals said three years were spent hammering out a formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.394" offset="7489515">The net result was the act of September 26, 1950; that provided for the transfer of the canal as a waterway to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.537" offset="7526087">And in connection with tolls, it provided that the toll should be based upon the canal activity, plus an appropriate share of the cost of the Canal Zone Government, the appropriate share to be determined on the basis of gross revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.793" offset="7599125">It was recognized that this formula would result in tolls going up and down from time to time according to fluctuations in costs and canal traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.742" offset="7642906">Now that left open the question of who would pay the remaining share of the cost of Canal Zone Government, and it was decided that, that remaining share should be paid by the business activities, that is to say the railroad, shipping line, commissaries and so forth, which as I say had been profitable over a period of many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.652" offset="7734544">Now, may I ask Your Honors refer to page of 167 of the record, which pages 164 to 167 set forth the report of the Armed Services Committee to the Senate on the bill which became the Act of September 26, 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.115" offset="7820434">Now Your Honors will note on the upper right-hand side of page, on the upper part of page 167, a worksheet setting forth the anticipated results of the formula which was embodied in the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.114" offset="7892428">Now the significant feature of this worksheet is that those are canal activity figures and not company wide figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.443" offset="7933701">If the formula would be on a company wide basis, the figures would be a great deal larger, would be around $90 million, $80 million to $100 million.</text>

            <text syncTime="2002.433" offset="8009665">The canal, not only charges tolls, but it also charges a fee for piloting a ship through the canal or certain small marine services which run to approximately, well less than 10% of tolls.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.185" offset="8080718">But, [Laughter] the outside revenue does not include the business activities, those would run the figures way, way up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.158" offset="8104542">Now I would also ask Your Honors to look at the paragraph in the middle of the page.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.850" offset="8127321">All of the above figures are stated in round numbers and are based on currently available financial data, and then is this significant sentence</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.272" offset="8156996">.The toll rate will of course be affected by any future changes in operating costs, interest rates and canal traffic and maybe revised either up or down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.927" offset="8195657">Now I further ask that Your Honors examine the first two full sentences on page 166, of the top of page 166, the remaining cost to the civil government, that is after the appropriate share of the canal activity, would be borne by the other business activities such as hotels, commissaries and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.579" offset="8294296">As a result the canal will be on a self-sustaining basis on the other collateral business operating in the Canal Zone must bear their proportionate share of the cost to the civil government, health and sanitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.851" offset="8351347">Now, so much for the legislative history; I've only hit the high spots.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.618" offset="8374439">Now, then the statute was enacted and I'll read to Your Honors Section 412(b) which is the key provision of the statute as we see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.127" offset="8452493">That's in Section 412, which is entitled ‘Basis of Tolls'.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.282" offset="8469107">Tolls shall be prescribed at a rate or rates calculated to cover as merely as practicable all costs of maintaining and operating the Panama Canal, together with the facilities and appurtenances related thereto, including interest and depreciation and an appropriate share of the net cost of operation of the agency known as the Canal Zone Government, then Section (b), goes on to provide that the appropriate share shall be determined on a gross revenues basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.185" offset="8584673">A further important provision of Section 412(b) was -- of Section 412 was subsection (d), which provides -- that -- which incorporates in domestic law for the first time Article III, Section 1 of the Hay-Pauncefote Treaty providing that toll shall be just an equitable, which I submit amounted to Congress saying that, that formula constituted its definition of what was just an equitable under the treaty.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Dickerman Williams</label>
            <text syncTime="2227.087" offset="8908278">Well, as far as the legislative history is concerned Your Honor, I rely -- the legislative history shows beyond all possible doubt, and I've gone into it at probably excessive length in my brief, that the business activities which had always kept separate accounts and which should never have been included within the canal accounts were to remain separate and were to bear their share of the cost of the Canal Zone Government, and of course if they were to bear their share of the cost the Canal Zone Government and only an appropriate share was to be borne by tolls, that would necessarily imply that they would continue to be kept separate from tolls.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.435" offset="9049652">But however my learned friend suggests that the expression together with the facilities and appurtenances related thereto may refer to such remotely connected facilities as the railroad and the shipping line and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.960" offset="9111824">Now, that suggestion is I submit not only answered by the legislative history, but it is also answered by the reference to Section 10 of the statute which is quoted at page 5A of the appendix to my brief, if Your Honors will refer to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.677" offset="9250691">There is the expression found again in language which from its context can only mean those facilities -- makes it clear that the language can only mean those facilities immediately connected with the canal, such as the lochs and the launches, towing locomotives and that sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.179" offset="9332715">The President is hereby authorized to transfer to the corporation the Panama Canal together with the facilities and appurtenances related thereto, in other words exactly the same language used a little later in Section 12(b), heretofore maintained and operated by the Panama Canal under -- excuse me, together with the facilities and appurtenances related thereto, and in other words a distinction is made, any or all of the facilities and appurtenances heretofore maintained and operated by the Panama Canal under (Inaudible) Section 1 of Title 2 of the Canal Zone Code as amended by Section 2 of the Act of August 12, 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.288" offset="9493107">Now the Act of August 12, 1949 shows that the other -- the facilities and appurtenances heretofore maintained are the business operations which the Panama Canal, the unincorporated agency has asked at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.100" offset="9560398">Now as the defendant corporation already had the railroad, the shipping line, and those other business activities, this statute which provides for a transfer cannot possibly relate to them, because the statute authorizing a transfer cannot relate to things that the transferee already has.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.372" offset="9645453">Now I also rely on certain admissions by the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.479" offset="9669904">One of these is its 1952 budget program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.073" offset="9684219">That budget program was prepared in the late Summer and Fall of 1950 and was given to Congress by the President in January 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.653" offset="9714521">In other words, it was prepared at the time when the legislative process was fresh in everybody's mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.799" offset="9739180">That budget program was submitted completely on our theory of the case, that is to say it had presented separate accounts for the canal activity and the other activities and showed that tolls were expected only to cover the cost of the canal activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.872" offset="9819429">The second admission to which we point is an opinion rendered by the general counsel of the defendant company to its President, all we know about that is a reference in the Comptroller General's 1954 audit report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.952" offset="9867807">And from that reference it appears that in December 1953, the defendant's President had submitted – prepared for submission to its Board of Directors a pricing policy statement, the gist of which apparently was that the prices of the business activities need a yield only enough to pay their direct operating expense, the implication being that all the overhead expense could be charged against tolls.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.726" offset="9974805">Now the defendant's general counsel, then according to the General Accounting Office report advised the President that that was unlawful, yet according to the General Accounting Office the President withheld that opinion from the Board of Directors, withheld the pricing policy statement from the Board of Directors and proceeded to go on and do exactly what his own general counsel had told him was unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.399" offset="10077518">I might say that I clamored in the District Court, I clamored in the Court of Appeals and I clamored in my briefs here for a copy of this opinion of the General Counsel but the defendant has not seen fit to give it to me, or give to the any of the courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="3067.271" offset="12268983">And it was against that situation, that the shipping industry protested in 1948 when an increase was proposed because of increased governmental and military costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.398" offset="12321541">At that time -- the situation was then brought to a head and we said, that's not fair, that's a national defense cost not a ship transit cost, and hence we should only pay part of the cost of the Canal Zone government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.008" offset="12375980">And I won't go through all the arguments back and forth but the net result was that the force of that argument was recognized by Congress in Section 412(b) which said that tolls would be prescribed on canal operation, interest on the investment to be fixed at the current rate being paid by the government, plus an appropriate share of the cost of the Canal Zone government.</text>

            <text syncTime="3890.974" offset="15563860">Now we say that the duty of the President under the Section 411 proviso was to enforce the law and to review the defendant's exercise of discretion, but not to act according to his whim or fancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3905.011" offset="15619971">We say that's because of the legislative history which shows that it was the intent of Congress to grant us relief here to establish a tolls policy, a policy which was very carefully considered, very carefully worked out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3919.878" offset="15679425">The references to the President's review power are practically negligible as the Court of Appeals pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3925.450" offset="15701786">Again the statutory precedents tolls policy has always been a matter of Congressional policy although the President has had a limited discretion within the framework of that policy and when President Wilson, when President Franklin Roosevelt wanted changes in that policy, they went to Congress for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3942.577" offset="15770227">We also say the language and the arrangement of the statute, Section 412 deals with policy, basis of tolls, Section 411 deals with authority and procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3953.387" offset="15813486">If the President was to have policy making powers inconsistent with the policy laid down by Congress that would be have been in Section 412.</text>
            <text syncTime="3962.126" offset="15848490">We also say because of the legal meaning which has been given this Court and other courts to the expression subject to the approval of, that has been repeatedly held to mean that the approving authority determines the lawfulness of the action of a subordinate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3975.328" offset="15901257">Whether the subordinate has acted within the law and this Court has held most emphatically that it does -- that subject to the approval of, does not give the approving authority, the privilege of substituting his own judgment for the will of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3987.666" offset="15950576">And in Daniels against Wagner this Court most sarcastically described the very argument which is advanced by defendant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3996.434" offset="15985685">We also say that it is true under the law of rate making, under which the legislative -- rate making as a legislative function, the legislature lays down a policy and leaves it to the executive branch or an independent agent to execute that policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4008.996" offset="16035944">We say it's also shown by the anomalous character of the non-statutory factors which this defendant proposes or the defendant consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="4015.837" offset="16063321">He proposes that for instance, the defendant proposes that the -- if the President may consider the welfare of the railroads, whether or not it will take business away from the railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="4024.801" offset="16099161">Now I submit Your Honor that it's anomalous and violative of our net good faith in the Hay-Pauncefote Treaty, that the shipping of the world, and 70% of shipping is foreign shipping, should have to pay a surcharge for the purposes of bolstering up a competing American facility, as a matter of fact only 10% of the traffic is intercoastal water traffic and that has been going down as compared with pre-war.</text>
            <text syncTime="4045.774" offset="16183066">If there's anybody that needs relief it's the intercoastal water carriers and not the railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="4050.948" offset="16203755">The defendant also suggests that the purpose is to consider the welfare of Suez that he must -- this traffic is to be -- this rate is too adjusted according to the needs of our foreign policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4061.759" offset="16247014">Now I submit that, that is highly improper, I mean do we say that the United Arab Republic may adjust the tolls rate at Suez according to the needs of its foreign policy, I submit that, that -- the answer to that question is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="4074.769" offset="16299050">And furthermore our construction fits in entirely with the Constitution which says that the function of the President -- that the -- a function of the President is to take care that the laws be faithfully executed and we say that the purpose here was that he take care that the defendant faithfully executed Section 412.</text>
            <text syncTime="4096.743" offset="16386926">Now even if are wrong in that however, we say the President's views of the law are not reviewable by the courts, still we say that we have the right to compel that this defendant to make a correct application of the statute under cases such as Virginia Railway against Federation and United States against Wilbur which say that a corporation and an agency maybe compelled to exercise their discretion according to the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="4169.515" offset="16678034">They overlooked the part in which the Comptroller General said that the formula for tolls should be changed to make sure that the cost to these business activities should not be charged against the taxpayer and that it should be incorporated in the tolls charge, that's one thing they overlooked.</text>
            <text syncTime="4188.121" offset="16752431">They apparently overlooked this language of the Comptroller General in the same report on page 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="4193.666" offset="16774583">If tolls revenue is insufficient to cover the minimum losses appropriations will be needed, such appropriations for the business losses would of course constitute a subsidy to the ship operators.</text>

            <text syncTime="4228.647" offset="16914495">They were allowed because of the defense features of this Canal Zone operation that the Congress recognized, they took out of the formula of the amount the government had invested in this canal, what they had -- the government had collected for some 40 years of time without any objection on the part of the Government of Great Britain or anybody else and that was the cost of the interest for the construction period.</text>
            <text syncTime="4258.733" offset="17034867">And that's a proper accounting charge because it did cost this government that amount of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="4264.895" offset="17059527">But in recognition of the defense aspect, the Congress took that out in figuring the amount of the investment that we had in the canal, and that's 2500 – that's $2.5 million a year, they've already got that credit for defense and they just want to try to get some more.</text>
