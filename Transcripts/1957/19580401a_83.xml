            <text syncTime="75.867" offset="303438">The pleadings in sort of orthodox fashion alleged unseaworthiness and negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.599" offset="346384">Before trial, the respondent interposed a plea of limitation both to the action under the Jones Act and to the action which petitioner here claims is also under the Jones Act but under the principles of the Maritime Law that proceeded the Jones Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.490" offset="441887">The theory of the respondent and the court below was that when the Jones Act was enacted, a two-year limitation statute prevailed and when the Federal Employers' Liability Act limitation provisional was increased to three years, it did not apply because it was not specifically provided in the extension as to the Jones Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.588" offset="554318">And also, stated and urged below that the cause of action for unseaworthiness has been barred by limitation because the two-year Texas Limitation Statute applied and not the two-year statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.134" offset="632477">The trial court overruled after hearing both of these pleas and trial was held on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.679" offset="666645">At the trial and conformity with the rules of civil procedure applicable in the State Court of Texas, special issues or interrogatories were submitted to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.078" offset="720248">The jury found first that petitioner did receive any injury to his body while attempting to walk down a set -- a set of stairs leading from a lounge to the galley below which he had to go in order to reach the engine room where he was employed as an engineer.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.707" offset="814811">The jury also found one of the allegations urged by the petitioner that the portholes over the stairs from which he fell were not watertight causing seawater to come in and making them dangerous causing his fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.320" offset="901224">The jury found that the portholes or windows over these stairs were not watertight.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.535" offset="938109">Petitioner insisted that the inquiry immediately following this inquiry should be was such on seaway the condition or was such failure to have these portholes watertight approximate cause of petitioner to the injuries on the theory of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.771" offset="1023060">Once the unseaworthy action or the effect has been found the unseaworthiness follows as a matter of law and the next one is just a question of approximate cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.747" offset="1070916">The Court refused to submit such an issue and instead asked the jury whether that failure to have these portholes or windows watertight rendered the vessel unseaworthy then gave a definition over the objections of petitioner stating you are instructed that by the term unseaworthy as used herein means that a vessel with it's appliances and the fittings is not reasonably fit for the purpose for which it is being used.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.806" offset="1231203">Petitioner objected first that there was an unnecessary question of the jury whether or not that led the vessel unseaworthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.345" offset="1265371">And secondly, stated that if the Court was to submit such an inquiry then the definition is erroneous because it emplaces a greater burden than the one upon petitioner, than the one required by law, because the definition requires the jury to find that by reason of that failure to have these portholes or windows watertight.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.406" offset="1361607">The vessel as a whole is unseaworthy whereas the burden upon us was to show that that particular port of the vessel was unseaworthy approximately causing injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.996" offset="1419912">The Court refused to do so and refused to do so on a similar issue inquiring about whether or not the deck above the galley was watertight, (Inaudible) shows that it wasn't and submitted the same type of issues.</text>

            <label>Mr. Arthur J. Mandell</label>
            <text syncTime="378.662" offset="1514580">Yes, particularly I say the vessel was unseaworthy in that setting specifically that portholes were not watertight and water would come through, the largest are from the stairs that the deck above the galley was not watertight, that water would come through and lodge itself on the steps very specifically set out.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.106" offset="1612382">Then I made the same objections and the same exceptions and requested the same definitions with reference to question number 14 but of course the same result.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.423" offset="1661597">The jury, however, was not 15 minutes and send an inquiry to the Court saying Judge Long does the term unseaworthy refer to the vessel as a whole or to the three portholes or three windows above the galley, the specific question.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.610" offset="1750413">The Court refused to answer to that stating, “We the Court, the charge contains all destructions and definitions.”</text>
            <text syncTime="447.911" offset="1791582">Jury of layman naturally answered the question of unseaworthiness no, that a jury was confused.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.658" offset="1834632">It's so clear by the issue that they've send out that at least no room for that otherwise they would have never send that very cautioned and intelligent question out.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.148" offset="1892519">Again, when the jury send out that question in conformity with our practice, are requested in writing that a Court issue, answer the jury the question that in connection with your answer, you are instructed that we have referenced to the portholes over the stairs leading from the lounge to the galley.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.718" offset="1978828">The Court refused it at that time again, I asked for a definite definition particularly pinpointing as the Court should that the defect we were talking about was not the vessel as a whole but the specific windows and the specific deck above the galley the Court again refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.397" offset="2077571">The jury found acquitted defendant that the respondent here of all negligence bound $22,500 for the damages and some $6000 plus for maintenance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1398.433" offset="5593652">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.712" offset="5606818">I would like to address our argument primarily almost solely to the question of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.477" offset="5641822">Mr. Mandell has in a large manner made summary of the jury findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.929" offset="5671706">There were some 34 special interrogatories submitted and only 15 of which were required to be answered to arrive at the verdict which the jury found because some of the issues were conditionally submitted upon a yes or no answer to a preceding issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.374" offset="5745476">The jury exonerated the respondent from any act of negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.748" offset="5766896">They did it specifically with reference to the specific acts about which inquiry was made and it did so generally by finding that the injuries resulted from an unavoidable accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.270" offset="5833038">The seaworthy issues were submitted as requested by counsel except insofar as he has outlined here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.782" offset="5871073">The jury found the condition existed but that the condition did not constitute unseaworthiness and under the Court's instructions they were not then required to determine the approximate cause issue which followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.813" offset="5931154">Now, to make my point as to the applicable statute of limitation, it is I think necessary to go to the historical backgrounds or a brief summary at least so long since the (Inaudible) or back in the early days of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.505" offset="6021956">The cause of action for unseaworthiness as a condition has been recognized as a matter of national law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.274" offset="6065006">The unseaworthiness in that since is a condition without regard as to why the condition existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.619" offset="6098442">The cause of action then that a seaman had under that law depended merely upon him showing that the condition existed and not showing how it came about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.417" offset="6149642">With the enactment of the Jones Act in 1920, the law then changed and the seaman's right were expanded in many particulars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.505" offset="6197917">As this Court well knows, the Jones Act adopts the provisions of the laws of the United States modifying the common-law rights of railway employees and that we commonly think of those laws as being the Federal Employers' Liability Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.910" offset="6279628">Now, the Jones Act has in it some substantive rights certainly and it adopts a statute which has any other substantive rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.085" offset="6324245">It is long been held that the statutory period prescribed in the Federal Employers' Liability Act is substantive rather than procedural since it comes within the rule that it is a portion of the statute creating the right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.912" offset="6395611">Now, Section 56 of Chapter 45 the Federal Employers' Liability Act modifies the common-law by prescribing a period of limitation within which the action provided in that law could be brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.777" offset="6475024">The reach and scope of Section 56 is limited to actions brought under this chapter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.023" offset="6516088">Section 52 of that chapter describes the actions which maybe brought under that charges and Section 52 relates to causes of actions by employees or survivors against the employers or injuries resulting -- injuries or death resulting in whole or in part from negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.683" offset="6626638">Now, shortly after the passage of the Jones Act, this Court have before it the case of Engel against Davenport and in that case the question was whether the prescriptive period provided in the Federal Employers' Liability Act at that time, two years, controlled over the statute of limitations in the State of California which at that time was a one year statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.490" offset="6741891">The Court recognized the problem which we have here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.645" offset="6758504">It found it unnecessary to decide the issue because the plaintiff there had declared upon a cause of action based upon negligence and unseaworthiness as a result of negligence, so the Court permitted the action within the longer period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.962" offset="6843768">The next case which is cited in our brief which most merely approaches our problem is the case of McGee versus the United States in 165 F.2d.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.093" offset="6892356">There, the Second Circuit discussed the holding in Engel against Davenport and interpreted that holding to mean that if the plaintiff declared upon a cause of action based upon negligence -- negligence on seaworthiness then it was incumbent upon him to make that proof in order to avail himself of a longer period of limitation as prescribed in the Federal Employers' Liability Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.365" offset="7013460">Now, I believed the law to be that when a summary -- that when a seaman, asserts an action for unseaworthiness in a state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.813" offset="7055151">He must bring his action within the state prescribed period if it is factually based upon unseaworthiness, simplicity around seaworthiness which exist as a condition not arising from negligence but that he may bring it within the period of the Jones Act as a connection arising under the Jones Act if the same condition is based upon some negligence of the ship or its owner.</text>

            <text syncTime="1830.307" offset="7321182">The statute of limitations which would apply to the same type of action brought in the law side on -- as an action at law in the Federal District Court and with trial by jury and so on under the election which the -- the seaman employee had would be governed I think under the same rules because of the rules of the decision act insofar as it would apply to the Federal Court sitting in that State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.117" offset="7432464">Of course, then on the admiralty side of the Court, you have an entirely different situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.190" offset="7468722">Now, it is our position here that since the jury facts have become the facts before this Court and particularly those with reference to negligence which were not made the point of objection on appeal at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.901" offset="7539566">In other words, the counsel did not raise in the court below and does not raise here any points of appeal relating to the cause of action which he asserted based upon negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.302" offset="7585123">And since the jury exonerated the respondent here from all acts of negligence then we must treat this case as if it were a case based only upon unseaworthiness simplicity or unseaworthiness which existed of the type that existed prior to the basis to the Jones Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2462.241" offset="9848895">This Court decided Arizona versus (Inaudible) of 1942 or 1943 or that about I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.534" offset="9882122">In that case, a seaman sued under the Jones Act for personal injuries and the attorney for the steamship company very advertly I thought came back and interpose the plea of assumption of risk stating that if they are going to take in the Federal Employers' Liability Act in total, they can take only the good and not the bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.846" offset="10003331">It would be bad and the -- at that time, the Federal Employers' Liability Act, I'm sorry was page 6, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.426" offset="10033633">The doctrine of assumption of risk could've been applied because the law hasn't been amended since 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.498" offset="10061949">This Court and the court below rejected that argument stating this that the Jones Act was not meant to limit the rights that a seaman had under the Maritime Law but why don't you enlarged it that a Jones Act wasn't drafted on the Maritime Law or which it became apart and I say therefore that while this Court had never had this question brought out before directly the question of limitation except in Engel versus Davenport which this Court particularly states we need not pass from the question whether the Jones Act period of limitation applies on a cause of action for unseaworthiness because we don't have it before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.418" offset="10241672">But in that case in the Arizona versus (Inaudible) case, this Court stated that a right that they had the -- the Jones Act do not afford the right to avoid the assumption of risk defense nevertheless it's right that they had an admiralty and it's embraced and continued and became a part of the Jones Act as I believe was a right of unseaworthiness and the statute of limitation under the Jones Act became a part of the Jones Act.</text>
