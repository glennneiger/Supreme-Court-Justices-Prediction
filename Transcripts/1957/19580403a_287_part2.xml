        <section startTime="0" stopTime="370.63">
          <heading>Argument of David W. Walters</heading>
          <turn speaker="david_w_walters" startTime="0.000" stopTime="370.630">
            <label>Mr. David W. Walters</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">-- is relying on the theory of -- the various subsections as the basis for which this man was denied the right to have his application for suspension of deportation considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.842" offset="67291">In other words, they are saying that the excluding provisions in each of the subsection will travel over to one or the others and particularly subsection (1) and prevent him from qualifying under subsection (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="31.161" offset="124552">That argument might have varied except that self-contain in each one of the subsections, there is a reference to classes of aliens who are excluded from consideration under that particular subsection.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.861" offset="191425">In subsection (1) it says, "Is deportable under any law of the United States" and the word "any law‚Äù is most significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.427" offset="229669">It means every law including the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 and all its subsections, and is not a member of a class of whose deportation could not have been suspended by reason of Section 19 (b) of the Immigration Act of 1917 which has pertinence to criminal and moral type of aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.758" offset="326949">Section 2 says, "It's not within the provisions of paragraph (4) of this subsection," this subsection.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.660" offset="370625">Section -- subsection (3) says, "It's not within the provisions of paragraph (4) or (5)."</text>
            <text syncTime="100.326" offset="401241">Subsection (4) says.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.504" offset="405943">"It's not within the provisions of paragraph (5) of the subsection."</text>
            <text syncTime="106.215" offset="424856">And in paragraph (5) enumerates numerous subsections within Immigration and Nationality Act but has no reference whatsoever, to any provisions of the Immigration Act of February the 5th, 1917 as does Section 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.185" offset="504686">Now, as I can be permitted with some liberties of the respondent's brief as far as this question of mutual excludability is concerned, I would like to read from page 13 of the brief -- the respondent's brief which they cite the reason for mutual exclusive theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.240" offset="612937">One, the only overlapping between (1) and (5) under the literal language of the statute is as to pre-1950 entrance.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.506" offset="666018">Deportable for failure to report or for worse, security offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.477" offset="685871">This is probably due to the fact that while these offenses were not so seriously regarded in 1940, they were considered very important in 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.585" offset="726309">The over -- overlapping in this limited respect probably represents a legislative oversight.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.181" offset="756715">And not -- in other words, what they are saying is that there does exist a legislative oversight and -- they want this question of mutual excludability between the sections that this oversight could be supplied by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.383" offset="825469">I don't think it was an oversight at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.556" offset="834142">I think it was designed.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.565" offset="838217">I think the legislative history which I referred to in my brief with exact quotes from the authorities shows that there was an intention that this subsection (1) stand out differently form all the others.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.259" offset="904986">They say that this must be the case, although they don't cite any reason for it in -- in language or expressions of any legislative body.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.774" offset="963082">This must be the case, because it deals Section 5 -- it deals with more -- a criteria of a more great nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.059" offset="1008222">And the consequences that there must be a more stringent application of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.079" offset="1036225">Well, I would like to call the Court's attention to the fact to Section 5 as contained within it, as a qualification.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.821" offset="1083246">Under paragraph (2) of Section 240 (a) -- 241 (a) is a person who has remained longer in the United States than the period for which he was admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.212" offset="1128803">That's precisely the ground on which the petitioner's deportation was sought originally.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.836" offset="1163285">It cannot be more stringent in this paragraph than it is paragraph (1) or more grave in paragraph (1) than it is in paragraph (5).</text>
            <text syncTime="298.944" offset="1195677">In addition to that, we're faced with the unusual phenomenon but let's suppose for example, that this man never came to the attention to the immigration service that he entered in 1947 prior to 1950 as he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.684" offset="1270700">He never came to the attention of the immigration service.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.693" offset="1290762">Subsequent to December 1957, he does come to the attention of the immigration service.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.700" offset="1314795">He is not charged with the additional charge that he is subject to deportation because he failed to report on a particular genre.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.089" offset="1356278">There is no place within this section or any of the subsections wherein this man could qualify for suspension of deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.570" offset="1398178">I can't think of anything more stringent than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.621" offset="1410403">So, the application of the law under subsection (1) in my opinion, the people of this class is more stringent than number (5).</text>

            <label>Mr. Maurice A. Roberts</label>
            <text syncTime="396.172" offset="1584588">That is true, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.299" offset="1597127">The facts briefly are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.524" offset="1602038">The petitioner has been ordered deported after entry in 1947 on two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.164" offset="1620637">First, as a seaman who failed maintain the conditions of his admission as a non-immigrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.633" offset="1646446">And second, as an alien who willfully failed to comply with the alien registration provisions of the 1952 Immigration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.530" offset="1682077">The latter violation is covered by Section 241 (a) (5) of the 1952 Act, and I stress that (5) because that is the Section which is referred to in the suspension provision which I shall shortly come to.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.249" offset="1752921">In 1954, he applied for suspension of deportation in the course of the deportation proceedings and was given a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.962" offset="1803807">The special inquiry officer found him deportable on the two charges, and after taking the testimony which he had a full opportunity to present his evidence incidentally, the special inquiry officer denied his application for suspension finding first that he was single and had no one in the country dependent upon him for support, and therefore he could not meet the hardship prerequisite to suspension which lies in every provision of the suspension statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.922" offset="1935673">The special inquiry officer also found that since the petitioner lacked 10 years of residence in this country, he could not meet the requirements of subdivision (5) of the suspension statute which is Section 244 of the 1952 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.563" offset="2018220">The fifth subdivision applies to persons who are deportable after entry on specified charges and one of those charges specified is the group deportable for failure to comply with the registration requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.498" offset="2097946">Having denied suspension of deportation, special inquiry officer ordered deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.692" offset="2130756">The petitioner appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals contending that since he arrived in 1947, and in 1954 he had seven years of residence, he came within the literal terms of the first subdivision of the suspension statute which applied generally to aliens who arrived in the United States prior to June 27, 1950 who were deportable generally under any law of the United States and who are not within the inhibition of Section 19 (d) of the 1917 Immigration Act which I shall discuss briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.288" offset="2281117">And the petitioner contends that his seven years residence qualifies him under the first subdivision and that his case should not be governed exclusively by the fifth subdivision which it -- with its 10-year requirement of residence which he concededly cannot meet.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.689" offset="2346736">The Board of Immigration Appeals after considering the evidence as stated in its opinion, show no reason to change the special inquiry officer's decision and the board specifically held that it was the fifth subdivision which governed exclusively in the petitioner's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.231" offset="2432836">The petitioner thereupon instituted declaratory judgment proceedings in the United States District Court in which the only ground he raised was the interpretation by the immigration authorities and the Board of Immigration Appeals with respect to the suspension statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.563" offset="2498247">He contended there that his eligibility could rest on the first subdivision notwithstanding the fact that he did not meet the requirements of the fifth.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.878" offset="2551432">And in the District Court, there was a hearing which took into account solely the administrative record.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.944" offset="2579749">There was no testimony or hearing de novo.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.881" offset="2591451">There was a stipulation -- an oral stipulation among the parties according to the judgment of the District Court which stated that the facts as found by the special inquiry officer and by the Board of Immigration Appeals was a correct statement of the factual situation, and there was also a stipulation, a narrow one, with respect to the issue before the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.729" offset="2694896">And in stating the issue, it was conceded that the petitioner was ineligible under the fifth subdivision because he lacked the physical requirements meeting the 10-year physical presence of the fifth subdivision, but it was stated he fully meets the requirements of the first subdivision.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.286" offset="2781100">And it was on this issue that the District Court rendered its declaratory judgment finding or declaring that the petitioner was ineligible to suspension of deportation under the suspension statute Section 244 (a) of the 1952 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.182" offset="2852676">On appeal, the Court of Appeals of the Fifth Circuit affirmed in an elaborate opinion which goes into great detail and which is printed in our -- in the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="751.287" offset="3005127">Does the fact that plaintiff is admittedly statutory ineligible for suspension and deportation under Section 244 (a) (5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, either plaintiff is not being able to meet the physical requirements of that section, preclude the plaintiff from presenting for consideration his application for suspension of deportation under Section 244 (a) (1) of said Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.726" offset="3114841">It's being admitted that the plaintiff fully meets the requirement at the latter section, and it says in the Court having heard the argument, a defiance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1741.793" offset="6967171">The first subdivision requires a showing of seven years of residence and good moral character immediately preceding the application, so that there was immediately apparent, a difference, a qualitative difference in the approach of the Congress to the two classes, and it seems clear that Congress intended the fifth subdivision with its more stringent requirements to govern the more serious offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.434" offset="7089633">In the 10-year residence period and good moral character period following upon the commission of the deportable offense, Congress evidently set up a reformed period, a probationary period, and it must be born in mind that most of the enumerated groups of deportable aliens set forth in the fifth subdivision were the ones who were absolutely precluded from suspension altogether under the 1917 Act because of the serious nature of their deportable offenses.</text>

            <text syncTime="1905.635" offset="7622531">In the case of aliens who were deportable on these serious types of charges, the statute requires ten years of residence before the alien can qualify for this lesser form of relief, so that it would be odd if Congress should preclude a person in the petitioners' class from the lesser form of relief of voluntary departure, and at the same time permit him to have the major form of suspension of deportation under the first category.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.781" offset="7763069">Then there is also this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.846" offset="7775295">The reform provision in the fifth category requires 10 years of residence and good moral character since commission of the deportable offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.271" offset="7825032">The first subdivision requires seven years of character -- of good moral character and residence, immediately preceding the filling of the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.262" offset="7857006">The petitioner arrived here in 1947 as a seaman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.381" offset="7873515">He could first establish the seven years of good moral character by 1954, but that was the very year in which he committed this alien registration violation which led to his being ordered deported under the fifth subdivision, and it was indeed anomalous for Congress to want him to be suspendable under the first subdivision when they extracted a 10-year probationary period from all the persons listed in this fifth category.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.722" offset="7994828">In our brief, we also developed at some length the fact that this various categories were designed to be neutrally exclusive, and there was some legislative history to support that.Unfortunately, most of the conclusions with respect to this legislation must be based on inferences drawn from facts because these suspension provisions were not the most controversial of the McCarran-Walter Act when it was in debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.620" offset="8118439">But in closing, I should like to point this out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.297" offset="8133172">The fifth subdivision is the only one which applies without time limitation whatsoever, it applies retrospectively as well as prospectively, it applies to all aliens of the specific classes enumerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.458" offset="8201822">And we believe that this is one instance where it can clearly be said that the rule of statutory construction should govern which states generally that a specific provision governs a general one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.612" offset="8278413">This Court has stated it very aptly in the Ginsberg case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.687" offset="8294713">The general language of a statutory provision although broad enough to include it, will not be held to apply to a matter specifically dealt with in another part of the same enactment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2130.841" offset="8523337">This is merely one of the instances in which these serious group of offenders are handled in a special form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.964" offset="8547788">More is required of them than of other types of deportable offenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.741" offset="8578926">And since this group has been so singled out, we believe that this overlap which is present if we read the statute literally, we believe that this overlap was not designed or intended by Congress to permit an alien who happens to fall within the overlap to take advantage of the more lenient provisions of the first subdivision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.269" offset="8681012">When it seems to us that Congress was most interested that those who fell within the fifth subdivision which encompass the most serious offenders should show a longer period of genuine reform and that Congress should be required to have a concurrent resolution before their suspension would be effective which is not the case with the first subdivision.</text>
