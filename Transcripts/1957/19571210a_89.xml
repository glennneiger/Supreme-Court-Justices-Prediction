            <label>Mr. David Rein</label>
            <text syncTime="31.867" offset="127373">Court please, petitioner here was convicted on both counts of the two-count indictment charging a violation of Section 23 of the Internal Security Act of 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.106" offset="188395">The offenses alleged in the indictment provided under statute in which he was convicted were one, a willful failure to depart; and two, the second count, a willful failure to make a timely application for travel documents necessary to his departure from the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.615" offset="266449">Both of these failures were alleged to have occurred during the six-month period following an order of deportation entered against the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.641" offset="306469">In other words under the statute, under the statute the crime is for an alien against whom an order of deportation as been entered, willfully fails to depart or willfully fails to apply for travel documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.506" offset="361953">As I say the petitioner is convicted on both counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.834" offset="379298">He was sentenced to a five-year of prison term on the first account, and imposition of sentence on the second count was differed until completion of the sentence on count one.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.191" offset="428722">Petitioner is a 67-year old alien, a native of Finland.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.939" offset="447739">He was ordered to be deported by the immigration service on the basis of a finding that he had been a member of the Communist Party from 1922 to 1930 and he was therefore deportable in accordance with the provisions of Section 22 of the Internal Security Act of 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.558" offset="530181">This order of deportation was affirmed by the Board of Immigration Appeals on April 9th 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.384" offset="565499">Some nine or ten days after the order of deportation was affirmed by the Board of Immigration Appeals, the petitioner was visited by a representative of the immigration service, Mr. Maki.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.219" offset="620774">The purpose of this visit was to complete a service form, to prepare and complete a service form headed Passport Data for Alien Deportees.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.817" offset="667167">This was the form regularly utilized by the service to obtain the personal history of any deportees in order to procure in accordance with its usual practice, the necessary travel documents for aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.421" offset="725682">Mr. Maki told the petitioner that the form would be used by the government for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.802" offset="751177">The petitioner fully cooperated with Mr. Maki.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.898" offset="763507">He gave him all the necessary information and the form was duly forwarded to the Chicago office of the service for processing.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.469" offset="797780">The record does not indicate what happened to that form subsequently.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.276" offset="817006">The government introduced no evidence on the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.594" offset="830276">Petitioner's efforts at the trial to discover what had occurred with that form was blocked by the Trial Court, the Trial Court saying it was completely irrelevant since the government owed the petitioner, in the Trial Court's language owed the petitioner no duty to assist him in affecting his departure.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.531" offset="906031">On April 30th 1952, and this is about a week to ten days after the visit to the petitioner by Mr. Maki, the officer in charge of the Duluth service, Duluth office of the immigration service sent a form letter to petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.450" offset="981786">It was on a mimeograph form and that letter is set out in full at page 8 to 9 of our brief beginning, “Dear sir, an order of which you have been notified directing your deportation on the following grounds has been entered.”</text>
            <text syncTime="260.700" offset="1042704">The crucial paragraph, we'll now deal with that letter, we have italicized, upright italics at page A and that paragraph reads as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.274" offset="1093068">“Arrangements to affect your deportation pursuant to search order are being made and when completed, you will be notified when and where to present yourself for deportation.”</text>

            <text syncTime="330.353" offset="1321378">The petitioner had in the deportation proceeding indicated, as he is entitled to under the statute, as it is granted the right on the statute, the choice of country to which he should be deported as Finland, his native country and this form is to get the necessary information so that the immigration service can go to Finland or the proper authorities in Finland to get travel documents for him to go to Finland and he did not keep that form, that form was then taken by the representative of service.</text>

            <text syncTime="360.830" offset="1443318">Well it normally does so far as it is in this record as a matter of fact, within the service that is usual practice to take the labeling.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.381" offset="1473515">As a matter of fact, we have the only testimony on this Court, in this record, the testimony given by the same Mr. Maki that so far as he knew, the petitioner could not have gotten a passport or travel documents except by going through the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.112" offset="1540389">He did not know, well, let's put it this way, the question was asked could the petitioner have gotten travel documents on his own and he said, “I do not know if that would have been possible.”</text>

            <text syncTime="405.680" offset="1622622">Just something that seems to be their normal practice, I can say that under the statute they are required to do it or they have the legal obligation, it just seems to be their normal procedure, procedure which -- that people get deported.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.657" offset="1678524">As I understand the purpose of it and the purpose of the statute was in a case where they in some reason or rather didn't succeed they could call upon the petitioner or the alien to do whatever might be necessary to pull out whatever documents might be necessary or to assist them in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.337" offset="1749264">I don't say that statute puts that upon the service, but that does seems to be the normal practice at least far as appears from this case and is, that is my notion.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.250" offset="1788970">Now perhaps the government might say otherwise.</text>

            <text syncTime="806.524" offset="3226018">Even at this late date, February 12th after this interview which, on which the government so heavily relies in showing a failure of the petitioner to carry out his obligation, the question as to what the service wished the petitioner to do is left up in the air.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.580" offset="3294250">The service officials still did not indicate to the petitioner that they thought he was delinquent in any respect, or that there was anything that they thought he should do at this time.</text>

            <text syncTime="840.326" offset="3361228">They have the letter of April 30th, they have his sworn statement of February 12th 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.366" offset="3385365">They have one other item of evidence and that consisted of the testimony of Mr. Maki who gave his version of the April interview with the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.310" offset="3433221">Maki's version of that April interview, upon which the petitioner stated, gave him the impression that he need do nothing, in all important respects fully corroborated the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.132" offset="3484526">Maki said he didn't recall the details of the interview.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.880" offset="3503438">He denied when asked whether he had specifically instructed petitioner that he need do nothing on his own until he heard from the service, but this denial of course in no way conflicts with petitioner's statement because petitioner never said that he was specifically told by Maki that he need to do nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.630" offset="3582433">He stated only that that was impression had gained as a result of the interview and on the basis of Maki's testimony even if we don't credit the petitioner of his own statement, that was the only reasonable impression he could have gotten.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.280" offset="3645022">Maki did testify that he informed petitioner that the purpose of the interview was to obtain information which will be forwarded to the Chicago office so that it might take the necessary steps to obtain travel documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.128" offset="3708447">Maki acknowledged further that so far as he knew, there was no other method by which petitioner acting on his own could have obtained the necessary documents and there was no question under any version of the interview and Maki himself conceded that he did not tell petitioner that he had to proceed independently of the service to obtain travel documents.</text>

            <text syncTime="982.849" offset="3931324">And Maki was the only government official who spoke to the petitioner between the time of his deportation and the time of the February 12th 1953 interview.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.462" offset="3993809">There was no other contact between him and the service except for the letter of April 30, which was sent to him.</text>

            <text syncTime="1148.569" offset="4594207">To change our argument as I have indicated earlier the government, the petitioner here was convicted on two counts; one is failure to depart from the country, two a failure to apply for travel documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.567" offset="4658260">However, as indicated by the instructions of the court and by the evidence both counts rest entirely on the government's position that there was a failure to apply to travel documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.885" offset="4715520">I wanted to deal with it later with the fact that that in itself was an invalid position but I want to address myself now to the insufficiency of the evidence to show a failure to apply for travel documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.745" offset="4766929">The indictment and the language of the statute charged the petitioner failed, “To make timely application in good faith for travel or other documents necessary to his departure.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.083" offset="4820323">The statute does not require an application in any way or indicate to whom the application must be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.928" offset="4851670">The petitioner here did in fact make an application for travel documents within the meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.956" offset="4879778">He did fill out this passport data for alien deportees, which was a form supplied by the service and regularly used by the service to obtain travel documents for aliens under orders of deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.775" offset="4943099">If moreover was told that the documents would be used for that purpose and the evidence in this record as indicated by Mr. Maki's testimony shows that the government had in the past obtained travel documents on the basis of just such a form and indeed as I've already indicated, Mr. Maki indicated he didn't know of any other procedure for obtaining travel documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.023" offset="5035990">The validity of this particular section of this statute was before this Court in Spector, at which time this Court sustained that provision of the statute against the charge that it was too vague, it would be impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.793" offset="5103073">But as I read Spector, we read Spector, it did it only on the ground and it could only upon the ground that in any particular case the passport visa requirements of a particular country were ascertainable, and that evidence would be shown in any particular case as to what was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.578" offset="5190217">The government apparently assumes that the application which the alien here made to the service was not a proper application for travel documents, it was insufficient to satisfy the statute, but there is no evidence here to support such an assumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.428" offset="5261688">There is no evidence here, the government introduced no evidence to show what would have been a proper application or what it apparently maintains or contends that the petitioner should have done in the way of making an application for travel documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.698" offset="5338697">Thus on this record, petitioner was convicted for failing to take some undefined action, which was not shown to be the necessary, useful or appropriate for the obtaining of travel documents, but he did apply for travel documents which was the normal channel for such application through the service, and although it does not appear that any other application was needed or would have even been useful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.590" offset="5458338">In Spector, which I have indicated earlier, the Court sustained this provision of the statute against the charge of vagueness, the Court said, the statute might well be a trap, if for example if required the alien to know the visa requirements for one or more countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.771" offset="5531063">I would say that the government's view of the statute, which it takes here and which says that petitioner could be guilty of a crime without defining exactly what it was he failed to do, would so convert the statute into a trap.</text>

            <text syncTime="1433.612" offset="5734400">The government does concede, I wish now to turn to what the government does concede is a necessary element in this crime, but even if there was evidence that the petitioner had failed to apply for travel documents within the meaning of the statute that as I say under the government's concession, the petitioner would not be guilty unless that failure was a willful failure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.831" offset="5839308">That it was incumbent upon the government to prove that the petitioner's failure to take action was in-spite of his knowledge of what was required of him and with the intent of completing his obligation under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.510" offset="5905972">In other words, because of the presence of the word willful in the statute, as a matter of fact under the doctrine of this Court in Morris Act we have to prove not only his failure to do something, but we have to prove his criminal intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.856" offset="5967412">Now the evidence to support a finding of willfulness in this case, is not only total lacking, but on the contrary all of the evidence that there is here shows not only that the government did not prove willfulness, but it completely negates any possibility of willfulness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.796" offset="6039092">First there was petitioner's statement which was introduced by the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.003" offset="6055915">Now that clearly negates willfulness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.919" offset="6067618">He explained his failure to take any action by the impression he obtained from the interview with Maki, that he need do nothing until he heard from the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.495" offset="6105966">He indicated he checked with his counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.951" offset="6115788">His counsel told him that he need do nothing until he heard from the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.645" offset="6134491">The government concedes that if that statement is taken on its face, that it does establish the petitioner's innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.497" offset="6165943">In other words if the facts as stated by the petitioner there were true, that was indeed his honest impression, the government concedes that a judgment of acquittal must have been entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.249" offset="6208993">It argues however, that the jury could have disbelieved the petitioner's assertion of good faith on the basis of other evidence in the record, but as I have indicated earlier in my statement in that case, there is no other evidence that conflicts with petitioner's assertion of good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.819" offset="6283180">On the contrary all of the other evidence corroborates it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.200" offset="6300735">Now I'll go so far as to say quite apart from the petitioner's statement, as to why he took no action because he was relying on Mr. Maki, but even the evidence aside from that proves his good faith and what is this evidence?</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.315" offset="6361234">One, there is Maki's version of the interview with petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.939" offset="6379729">I've already gone over that to show that it's fully collaborating the petitioner and he told him that he was going to use this form, it was going to be sent to Chicago, and he did not say to him that he need do anything on his own; secondly, the letter of April 3rd.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.129" offset="6460500">Now the government makes the point in that letter, in which it says that, sure they did have this paragraph which I have italicized, in which it said arrangements to effect your deportation are being made and we will let you know when and where to present yourself for deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.359" offset="6541375">But says the government, the letter then did go on to set out the text of the statute and presumably according to the government, the petitioner should have read the text of the statute as nullifying the flat statement of the government, saying that they were taking care of the matter and they would let him know when they wished him to do something.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.507" offset="6633953">Now I submit the text of the statute does not indicate to me, does not indicate to this Court in Spector and cannot possibly indicate to anyone, that there is a requirement, an unequivocal plain requirement on the petitioner to do something independently of his own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.482" offset="6705842">If they had sent him the text of the statute alone it would not have given him that notice, but to argue as the government does that he should read from the text of that statute, that nullification as clear language by the government, that they were taking care of the matter and he could wait until he heard from them, I say is simple nonsense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.209" offset="6784836">As a matter of fact, if the government had the burden of proof (Inaudible), even if we wind up with the conclusion that there was an ambiguity or confusion, then the petitioner here was innocent, because even if he failed to do something because he was confused, he is entitled to a judgment of acquittal.</text>

            <text syncTime="3171.346" offset="12685375">And even where there is review all that the judge reviews is that there is some evidence to support it, that there has not been a violation of some regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3421.452" offset="13685760">The distinction made, if I may turn to question of the Yakus case, or between this case and the Yakus case, is that the Yakus case was an administrative regulatory procedure setting out standards of conduct to guide people in the future, in contrast to the nature of a deportation order which is an adjudication of guilt in a particular case against a particular individual, and it is not a general regulatory matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.818" offset="13847197">As a matter of fact this is significant, I think this point should be made clear, that this statute, that is this self deportation statute does not apply to any order of the deportation, it applies only to orders of deportation based upon certain grounds, and those grounds are grounds which apparently the Congress had some guilt attached to that, because they referred to some persons, criminals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.441" offset="13969763">This particular alien here was ordered deported on two grounds, one his entry into this country without a visa as well as his past membership in a Communist Party.</text>

            <text syncTime="3557.408" offset="14229629">But that case we say where you have an administrative classification for draft purposes is very different from a determination that an individual is guilty of some past misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.582" offset="14290233">You had in Cox, an application by an individual to be exempt from a rule that applies in general to all people, and the determination made there by the Selective Service boards is not a finding of guilt, but simply that a person is not entitled to an exceptional privilege, and we here say as a matter of fact, the whole procedure which is employed in the Cox statute, seem to indicate by this Court's opinion also in the Nugent case show that was a type of procedure in which this Court thought because of the exigencies of the situation that the individual was entitled to very low in the nature of due process and as I said, that also underlie the aspect of the Nugent case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.547" offset="14510184">I would say that Cox a very special case limited it to the fact that here is an individual who is asking for a special privilege from an obligation imposed upon all citizens in the service, is not the same that's involved in this type of case where there is finding of guilt.</text>

            <text syncTime="3883.897" offset="15535543">No, I am stating that the examples that we did give and that is not only the administrative area, it is a terrific field and we thought that the thing had been very well decided more recently -- very well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3899.891" offset="15599491">Now this case has so many issues as to which various states of facts are pertinent that I am afraid that it will be necessary to summarize first what the government says rather than leaving to its presentation before as to what we contend and secondly to give some run down on these facts and their order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3923.139" offset="15692487">We think it's very important that when a certain interview happened, when a certain notice was served and I am going to try the rather difficult thing of at least presenting this whole picture so that we have the order because after all this is a very important request that this Court should go over a cold record and disbelieve the witnesses that the jury patently believed, get the impression that the instructions were not adequate without any view of the entirety of those instructions and without any view also on the facts that were in the case, so I am -- if I may I would like to give the chronology as quickly as possible with the, with two caveats to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3970.442" offset="15881718">One I expect to support everyone one of those items on the evidence point by going directly to the record later after I finish this brief summary and secondly the Court should have in mind that since there are some other questions that is the attack on the deportation proceedings, the innuendo that the government is holding out things and is entrapping him and the complaint that the judge shouldn't have sentenced this man severely, that the facts -- that other certain facts that were before the judge and were not before the jury are going to have to be told in this chronology.</text>
            <text syncTime="4008.104" offset="16032392">I want to warn the Court that when I get to discussing the evidence before the jury, then I will restrict myself to the evidence before the jury, but in this summary relating to these other questions at the outset, the facts up to the trial are in exhibits one and two that are lodged with this Court and did not go to the jury because this judge was scrupulously careful to keep from the jury, all the troublesome things that had been adduced to him in the assault on the deportation proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="4042.535" offset="16170109">He kept even the Board of Immigration Appeals' opinion from the jury and only allowed to be read in the facts that they had decided against petitioner and not the reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="4054.238" offset="16216921">So in this chronology if the Court would bear with me, when I get to the evidence, I am going to be very careful of what was before the jury, that I don't want to misrepresent to the court within these earlier things.</text>
            <text syncTime="4067.888" offset="16271464">There is -- all of this went to the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="4070.686" offset="16282645">Now petitioner was born in 1890.</text>
            <text syncTime="4075.724" offset="16302811">He came to Canada in 1910 and he became a Canadian citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="4082.484" offset="16329874">He has been a Canadian citizen for anything that appears on the record all of the time, since that time and through the six months period that's critical in this criminal indictment and let me interrupt myself this is -- this evidence was before the jury as well as all the other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4101.902" offset="16407510">He has been a Canadian citizen for over 40 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="4106.760" offset="16426945">He came to the United States in 1916 and that entry was a legal entry, probably the last legal entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="4116.509" offset="16466024">He joined the Communist Party in 1922 or '23.</text>
            <text syncTime="4120.978" offset="16483892">There is a dispute about it, but there is no dispute that he was in it until 1930.</text>
            <text syncTime="4125.038" offset="16500088">The Court of Appeals below found that he had been Communist Party member after that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4133.301" offset="16533107">He went to Russia in 1932 without travel documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="4139.232" offset="16556826">He stayed there for three years in the Soviet Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="4141.840" offset="16567275">He came back in 1935 also got in without travel documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="4148.733" offset="16594860">Then in 19 -- I should say also that for 15 years he was editor of a newspaper, a Finnish language newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="4160.220" offset="16640836">Now, in 1949 the government began the process of trying to deport him.</text>
            <text syncTime="4166.336" offset="16665287">At that time there were two grounds, one because when he came back from Russia he came out -- came in without the proper documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="4173.970" offset="16695798">Two as a member of a subversive organization, and that was changed after the 1950 act, to the specific designation of the Communist Party membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="4183.734" offset="16734877">Now the length of time in which these proceedings were delayed I don't want the court to get an impression of any improper delay there, because it was -- the petitioner was entitled of course to pursue every remedy, but all things do come to an end that he was properly ordered deported in April 9 of 1952, that is one of the Board of Immigration Appeals finally included these deportation proceedings, after many -- after appeals to that board and the matter was completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4227.282" offset="16909061">Then I would like to fix that date by repetition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4232.551" offset="16930168">We are now in 1952 and we are beginning that six months period in which the statute required that he do something.</text>
            <text syncTime="4242.830" offset="16971233">Now we will look at that statute, which was passed in 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="4247.907" offset="16991608">That statute provided a penalty if the alien did not depart, if the alien did not get travel documents and three, not indicted here, but of significant contrast, if he connived to hamper the getting of documents for it, and four the completely differentiated thing, if he failed to show up when the Attorney General ordered him to show up for deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4284.614" offset="17138416">That's the statute and the statute of course is presented fully in our brief here and elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="4291.304" offset="17165166">Well -- and the Court of Appeals below summarize in its opinion those four aspects of it, so that there is no doubt and I don't know that the petitioner has blankly stated that there is any doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="4304.296" offset="17217097">I may explain about that statute, that it arose on legislative history, not concerning the separation of offences as has been stated to the Court, but to meet the single problem that there were hoards of aliens left in this country who just couldn't be deported and the legislative history that we have cited in our brief was the testimony before the Congress, before prior legislation which did become this legislation only with a more severe criminal penalty indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4340.027" offset="17360039">There was testimony that aliens whom the government could not deport by itself applying for papers, could get out when they chose to do so, the then Attorney General, now of this Court testifies as to nine specific cases in which that had happened, that is also cited in our brief and that is what is the object of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4368.401" offset="17473515">So that in a sense the inquiry as to what the government did or did not do concurrently is not significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4377.339" offset="17509355">Now, as to that statute let me state something else, we do not state, nor has there been any confusion whatsoever that the government could go ahead concurrently and as an ordinary matter, it did do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="4394.806" offset="17579154">It did not trust either the integrity or the competence of some of these aliens to get going.</text>
            <text syncTime="4400.965" offset="17603814">While this statute was specifically designed as reported from the congressional record to give an incentive to these aliens to do something themselves, nevertheless the government was not required to wait for them to do something.</text>
            <text syncTime="4415.585" offset="17662328">So that, I want to make it clear, we do not contend here that the government can't do anything or that the government doesn't do anything.</text>

            <text syncTime="4480.967" offset="17923866">There was definite and uncontested evidence by the immigration inspector that the government ordinarily tries to get the man out even while he is making his concurrent efforts, but there was a definite denial that the government does it in all cases and for that purpose, let me explain something about this form without reaching it yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="4510.709" offset="18042776">This data form Exhibit 9, I better refer to it that way, that the inspector goes out right after the deportation order and gets, is an information form on which the government tries to act, but on the back of that form, I'm sorry this is not reprinted, it is an exhibit, on the back of that form there is a paragraph in which it is asked that the alien disclose whether he has an expired passport, birth certificate and other certificates which has been used by the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="4547.181" offset="18188643">If he disclosed that he had papers already and could get out by himself, in those cases and now I'm speaking off the record, the government does nothing, and I think that those are the cases referred to in the testimony before the jury, where this man vigorously denied, I mean the immigration testimony, vigorously denied that in all cases they do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4571.849" offset="18287386">Very diligent counsel for petitioner asked his man Maki over and over again, the immigration inspector, doesn't this mean that the government will do something, and he repeatedly said no they will consider it, that's what this form is for; this is not an application form.</text>
            <text syncTime="4590.280" offset="18361051">It was filled out by the immigration inspector, it is not signed, it's a data form, and there is, and I'm quoting the record here, the office in charge stated that this form is sometimes taken by a hearing officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4605.826" offset="18423223">It is not a matter of application for documents at all, and of course it's differentiated from document because it refers to the documents right within the form asking whether he has it, that there be no confusion of this form, once it's examined.</text>

            <text syncTime="4869.254" offset="19477002">The jury took this form of notice into the jury room with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4874.638" offset="19498527">And when it is read without prior emphasis, I think that the jury was well entitled not to rely on just one paragraph of it but recognize that form for what it was, a form that stated a variety of contingencies and what is more particularly, the last paragraph which could not have related to the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="4898.991" offset="19595912">In other words the first paragraph advised him, the government was going to try to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4904.857" offset="19619422">He needed, he was properly warned of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4907.479" offset="19629871">Then it stated the statute which showed the four different activities, his own duty to depart, his own duty to get documents, his own duty not to connive to hamper and his own duty, and then his duty not to refuse the documents if the Attorney General should present to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4928.580" offset="19714299">And then comes the last paragraph of all which if we were italicizing, I would italicize, here is what it says.</text>
            <text syncTime="4937.118" offset="19748467">“Therefore you will recognize the importance of making every effort in good faith.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4943.020" offset="19771977">Let me stop there, if they have been talking about government efforts, they wouldn't have said in good faith, they were talking to him then.</text>
            <text syncTime="4949.683" offset="19798727">“To obtain passport or other travel documents so that you may affect your departure pursuant to the said order of deportation within the time prescribed by the quotation above from the Internal Security Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4966.120" offset="19864451">Now of course I know the argument on that and that is that he was a poor ignorant man that couldn't be expected to deduce all of those from this notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4974.233" offset="19896842">But the answer to it is that this man didn't do anything without checking with his attorney, he had long experience in picking everything possible available to his case.</text>
