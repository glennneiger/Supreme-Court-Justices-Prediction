            <text syncTime="40.967" offset="163840">This is the case on review from the Eighth Circuit to review the refusal of an order in a motion requested by the petitioner for the Court to exercise its equitable jurisdiction to stay in order to cease and desist issued by the Federal Trade Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.985" offset="299886">That's the sole issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.618" offset="330397">In 1949, the Federal Trade Commission filed a complaint against the petitioner alleging that it had discriminated in prices along it's purchasers in violation of Section 2 (a) of the Robinson-Patman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.964" offset="439798">That discrimination consisted of offering volume discounts to all of its customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.496" offset="485982">That discount being in the form of an annual discount based on the volume of purchases, 2000 to 3000, 3000 to 4000, 4000 to 6000 and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.883" offset="559438">It's set out in the record, each amount being a larger discount.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.260" offset="580963">The record shows that that discount in some form or other, that volume discount is more or less standard practice in the Automotive Replacement Parts Industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.090" offset="652330">The Automotive Replacement Parts Industry consists of many different things.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.507" offset="673959">In the case of Moog Industries for the sake of convenience, they have leaf springs, chassis part, coil actions and piston rings.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.406" offset="721607">They have three classifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.416" offset="737593">Several thousand parts intervene the lowest various classifications adoptable to cars going back as far as 1937, the various types of car.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.907" offset="803527">There's no question that these volume discounts were offered to all their customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.895" offset="831530">There is no question that it is standard practice in the industry to offer those discounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.088" offset="864340">The record shows that by testimony as we have referred to it in our brief in various places.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.443" offset="889731">In addition to that, there are exhibits attached to the record which show contracts for volume discounts, McQUay Norris, Regal Tool and Manufacturing, Thompson Products as typical contract showing those exhibits.</text>

            <text syncTime="296.458" offset="1185750">When that order was entered, we filed our motion to state that order and for the Court to exercise its equitable jurisdiction and hold it in the bench until our competitors in that industry were subjected to like orders.</text>

            <text syncTime="394.128" offset="1576438">So far, there has been nine years of litigation as I construe this record from what the Federal Trade Commission brief says to proceed in nine cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.346" offset="1657313">To date, they have filed nine cases but all together -- now, wait a minute, I'm wrong on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.589" offset="1702348">They have filed 14 cases but all of them have not proceeded to a conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.762" offset="1734949">For instance one against our largest competitor Thompson Products which had been going on for several years has not been brought to a decision to an initial decision by the hearing commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.747" offset="1798896">There is no question in the record documentarily and from testimony that its standard practice in the industry.</text>

            <text syncTime="475.197" offset="1900774">It is my understanding, Your Honors that a motion of that sort is more or less ancillary to the proceeding for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.872" offset="1951451">The Federal Trade Commission is not a judicial body, these (Inaudible) states.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.485" offset="1981858">Therefore, it has no equitable jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.535" offset="1998054">It can't decide questions of equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.894" offset="2015504">So let us start first (Voice Overlap) to the jurisdiction of an appellate court by looking at what the statute says.</text>

            <text syncTime="2057.853" offset="8231393">Counsel has made reference to the cosmetics case, the fact that the Federal Trade Commission entered into an understanding that the Court's decision in the Elizabeth Arden case would bind the parties with respect to other pending proceedings which were at various stages of the administrative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.926" offset="8331703">The Commission exercised it's discretion as in its law enforcement capacity in entering into this understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.797" offset="8367125">It did subsequently dismissed six -- those six pending cases and attempted -- and did have a Trade Practice Conference to suggest rules of conduct for the parties and it is a fact that after the Trade Practice Conference and after they'd all signed the pledge card, the Commission found it necessary to institute an industry wide investigation of the cosmetics industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.858" offset="8475376">It issued complaints against three of those against whom it had dismissed the cases and the other three had signed the pledge cards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.418" offset="8533577">This illustrates graphically, I think, the fact that these voluntary procedures of the Commission indeed of any law enforcement agency are no better than scraps of paper unless they are backed up by firm enforcement of the laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="2165.741" offset="8662936">It is also true since we've gone beyond the record that the Department of Justice subjected to the holding of that Trade Practice Conference because it then had under investigation certain segments of the industry and it was not -- and it is not the department's policy nor that of the Commission to settle by Trade Practice Conferences, matters which are in litigation or where substantial amount of investigative authority has been exercised and substantial amounts of the public's money spent to investigate the practice or where there is real controversy with respect to the legality or illegality of the practices in question.</text>

            <text syncTime="3077.210" offset="12308793">Once an order of the Commission has been issued in a case of this character and has been affirmed by Court of Appeals, there comes the arduous process of securing compliance with that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.536" offset="12374100">First, there is the 60-day waiting period during which respondent may adjust its business and must at least convince the Commission of its good faith and effort to comply with the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.882" offset="12431464">The division of compliance which is lodged in my office has authority on its own motion and without reference to the Federal Trade Commission to grant an additional 60 days during which respondent may use good faith in attempting to adjust his business practices.</text>
