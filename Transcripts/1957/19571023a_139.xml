            <text syncTime="24.749" offset="98952">This case is one of certiorari to the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.191" offset="124761">The decision sought to be reviewed as a denial by the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas of an application for writ of habeas corpus seeking the release of the petitioner from custody of the warden of the State Penitentiary of Texas for the reason that his conviction is void and that it was based on perjury and suppressed evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.062" offset="220160">Jurisdiction of the Court is invoked under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.574" offset="250253">The questions are, have the provisions of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments been violated or has an accused been afford -- afforded a fair and partial trial where (1) the prosecutor advised and encouraged the only eye witness to the killing who was also the State's main witness to deny and not to admit nor volunteer facts favorable to the defendant, which facts would have mitigated his punishment at the hands of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.675" offset="378671">And further, where the witness, having received the foregoing advise from the prosecutor, committed perjury regarding matters vital and material to the issues of guilt or punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.390" offset="429558">And further, where the prosecutor before the trial had begun, received certain information vital and material to the issues of guilt or punishment favorable to the defendant but unknown to the defendant that such evidence was in possession of the prosecution, failed and refused to apprise the Court, the defendant or the defendant's attorney of the same so that such evidence would be available to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.487" offset="545855">But instead, having advised the defendant -- the witness to deny such facts, the prosecutor then proceeded to question the witness regarding these facts, received answers known to the prosecutor to be untrue, sat mute and neither informed the Court nor the defendant that the testimony of the witness was false.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.308" offset="645224">In the trial of the case, the State of Texas, while putting on its main case, called to the witness stand one Natividad Castilleja, and after eliciting testimony from him regarding the stabbing of the wife of the defendant, Herlinda -- Herlinda Alcorta, got from him testimony that he was -- the girl meant nothing to him that she was a friend of his sister's, that he had met her at his sister's home, that his sister made statements to him to the effect that this girl is a friend of mine, she lives near you and she works near you and I'll appreciate it if you'll give her a ride home from time to time.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.715" offset="834769">After bringing out that testimony and the testimony regarding the killing, this further testimony was elicited from that witness</text>

            <text syncTime="279.214" offset="1116787">The defendant then took the witness stand in his own defense after the State addressed it and testified about his wife's misconduct with several men including this witness, Castilleja.</text>

            <text syncTime="320.583" offset="1282299">And I'm reading now from page 30 of our brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="493.073" offset="1972245">Yes, they do, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.943" offset="2003696">Under Texas law, murder is divided, so to speak, into two categories, murder with malice which is punishable by confinement in the penitentiary from two years to life or death in electric chair.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.438" offset="2057718">Included in that is the offense of murder without malice.The punishment for that is confinement in the penitentiary from two years to life and no more.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.978" offset="2107873">And on page 6 of our brief referring to Article 1257b Penal Code of the State of Texas and all the cases tried under the provisions of this Act, it shall be the duty of the Court to define malice or forethought and shall apply that term by appropriate charge to the facts in the case and shall instruct the jury that unless they find from all the facts, in all the circumstances and evidence that the jury believes the defendant was prompted and acted with his malice or forethought they cannot assess his punishment at a period of longer than five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.189" offset="2284669">The following article defines murder without malice.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.438" offset="2305672">Murder without malice is a voluntary homicide committed without justification or excuse under the immediate influence of a sudden passion arising from an adequate cause by which is meant such cause is what commonly produced the degree of anger, rage, resentment or terror and a person of ordinary temper sufficient to render the mind incapable of cool reflection and in connection with that I think we should make some reference at this point to Article 1257a on the preceding page, page 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.126" offset="2468467">In all prosecutions for a felonious homicide, the State or the defendant shall be permitted to offer testimony as to all relevant facts and circumstances surrounding the killing and the previous relationship existing between the accused and the deceased, together with all relevant facts and circumstances going to show the condition of the mind of the accused at the time of the homicide which may be considered by the jury in determining the punishment to be assessed and then it goes on to include the Suspended Sentence Act or Law rather.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.272" offset="2621022">Now, our position is this that the defendant under Article 1257a certainly had the right to tell and to show the jury, the circumstances under which he found his wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.549" offset="2694165">The suspicions that he had had about her conduct for sometime, suspicions that were confirmed when he woke up and found her under the circumstances, he said he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.465" offset="2741812">And since he had that right, he had the further right to be corroborative in his testimony regarding his state of mind by the honest and the unpurged testimony of the witness, Natividad Castilleja, who, had he told the truth would have corroborated the defendant or the petitioner to the extent that the jury, undoubtedly, in my mind would have come to the conclusion that what this man says is true, the conditions under which he found his wife are true and they are conditions that probably would render the mind of a man incapable of cool reflection and a killing under those circumstances is murder without malice and the punishment cannot be more than five years.</text>

            <text syncTime="2605.906" offset="10423589">Now, speaking about putting this information in the jacket and this being a matter of public record, in this record Mr. Barrera, in the hearing on the writ, admitted that had any attorney, Alcorta's attorney or anyone else before the trial was over, came in and asked to see that information or to see that jacket that he would not have given it to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.738" offset="10522854">I asked him a specific question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.459" offset="10529750">I asked him, “Would you after the trial wasn't over but in due time to raise all these on newly discovered evidence?</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.029" offset="10560052">Would you give him that information?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.686" offset="10566740">At that time he said, “No, not until the appeal is over and everything is closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.033" offset="10584085">But he, in several instances in the record, he refers to all this information being in the jacket and being a matter of public record and that all or any attorney had to do was to get custody, has his name off the indictment, go out and see him and get the same information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.044" offset="10652108">However, he seems to overlook the fact that he has told Castilleja on several other occasions not to -- not to see anyone, not to talk to anyone, not to give anyone any -- any information at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="6605.844" offset="26423275">It is a finding and I can suggest only that it is a finding of one of the judges in a concurring opinion of the Court of Criminal Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="6613.731" offset="26454831">And I submit that that is within the rule of the Fay case and other cases where findings of a trial court or an appellate court are entitled to great weight by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6623.764" offset="26494955">I don't take the position that in a constitutional matter that the Court in all the cases is going to ignore what the findings might be and -- or be bound by it in advance, certainly not.B</text>
            <text syncTime="6634.554" offset="26538214">ut we feel in this case here that the evidence being what it is so much of it is hearsay, hearsay based on hearsay, the fact that Mr. Barrera was supposed to have been quoted in some out-of-court hearing in the Board in the matters of that saw these as certain matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="6649.648" offset="26598504">He is basing his contentions upon that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6653.274" offset="26613029">He is basing his contentions upon affidavits from the witness Castilleja, one of the affidavits that he quoted from here exhibit C was a matter of the very, very first affidavit that he quoted from but he did not mention the portion in the affidavit where the witness is supposed to have said, "I admit that I lied at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="6674.614" offset="26698397">I was asked the question by our court with this lawyer as to whether I had intercourse and I denied it and I admit purging in substance."</text>
            <text syncTime="6680.990" offset="26723892">That's what he's supposed to have stated in one of the affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="6684.478" offset="26737894">Then upon the trial, he repudiates those affidavits and evidence of that character and testifies openly in court and states unequivocally we have recited the places in our brief where he says, "I told the truth."</text>
            <text syncTime="6698.223" offset="26792856">He makes explanations as to his answers here as I said a moment ago about dates and other matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="6703.357" offset="26813336">“I told the truth and the reason I did not go into the matter of intercourse was that I was not asked those questions.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6711.970" offset="26847817">Now, we feel that this case does not come within the ruling of the cases cited by petitioner, and that is, the Dyer case and the Baldy case and the -- the Dyer, the Baldy and the Reagan cases.We think those are extreme cases where Francis in the Reagan case, a man was prosecuted for rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="6735.366" offset="26941440">The state had evidence at that time from the doctor who had examined the prosecutor, there was no rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="6741.635" offset="26966518">The prosecutor to -- was a virgin.</text>
            <text syncTime="6743.579" offset="26974250">In other words, the very prosecution itself was a fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="6747.878" offset="26991491">Then you have the two Circuit Court decision cited here, Dyer and Baldy concerning the matter of suppression.</text>
            <text syncTime="6755.267" offset="27021061">We feel that those facts are far and above extreme the facts that we have in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6760.475" offset="27041855">In one case, where the -- the bullets were an evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="6764.144" offset="27056483">In other words, there was a question where the men were robbing a store there and the question was who actually shot the deceased, was it the defendant or even policemen?</text>
            <text syncTime="6772.940" offset="27091696">And the State sought to prove that the defendant fired the fatal shot knowing all the while that it had evidence, it had a bullet and it had an expert witness by hand to testify that no, it wasn't the defendant's bullet, it was a policeman's bullet that killed the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="6787.400" offset="27149584">That basic, that extreme, in other words, keeping out evidence or trying to prove to the jury that the defendant did fire the fatal shot knowing all along that he had not fired the fatal shot and the Dyer case is equally extreme in a situation where the State there, the State of Pennsylvania sought to prove that -- and did prove by certain witnesses that the defendant was sober at the time of his arrest knowing at the very same time, a witness who did not testify and was kept away from the trial and was excused on the night of that night session was going to testify that he was drunk.</text>
            <text syncTime="6822.650" offset="27290540">Now, you have compounded in those cases a situation where in the Baldy, where counsel for the defendant asking whether you have other bullets, you couldn't have it in certain bullets but do you have other bullets and no reply was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="6838.073" offset="27352189">You have in the Dyer case, compounding this fraud is overt fraud to the Court and to the jury, you had counsel rising up and standing and saying there's no use calling this second State's witness, the second policeman.</text>
            <text syncTime="6850.487" offset="27401927">He'll only corroborate the first policeman when he knew that was false telling them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6856.048" offset="27424183">Also you have the situation there where in Pennsylvania, the jury was instructed that the prosecutor had called all of his witnesses and he sat there and listened to the Court instruct the jury in that fashion knowing that he had not called that witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="6871.206" offset="27484787">Now, I want to get to a matter that I think is basic and that is the matter brought up and suggested in one of the cases cited by the petitioner, that is the matter cited in the Baldy case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6881.927" offset="27527628">One of the reasons probably holding in the Baldy case was that this evidence was so well-concealed that you could not fairly accuse defendant's counsel of lack of due diligence and that's a matter that they have skirted around that they have avoided at all times in this case and in this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6900.802" offset="27603174">The matter of the diligence and we suggest in our brief that he has not exercised the diligence and all of the matters available to him to discover these very matters.</text>

          <turn speaker="raul_villarreal" startTime="6920.621" stopTime="7192.486">
            <label>Mr. Raul Villarreal</label>
            <text syncTime="6920.621" offset="27682482">I might say, Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honor that we contend here as a size of the evidence that there's -- there's no disputed issue of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="6931.757" offset="27726994">One, the prosecutor admitted before the Court and before all the evidence that was submitted that he told a man that the evidence was inadmissible, that -- and further, that he knew about the intercourse and further, it's a public record that the questions that were asked of the prosecution -- prosecution witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="6957.620" offset="27830439">Now, the -- the issue is as a matter of law, was there suppression of vital and material evidence beneficial to the defendant and they claim they make the attempt to even make the case stronger for the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="6977.292" offset="27909120">They say, he didn't even know about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6979.987" offset="27919882">Now, I want to say that the prosecutor knew what, the defendant knowing about this, way before the case came to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="6994.879" offset="27979442">When he took the statement from Natividad Castilleja, that was about two weeks to 10 days according to his testimony on the writ of habeas corpus after he took the statement from Alcorta, he took the statement from Castilleja.</text>
            <text syncTime="7014.761" offset="28058958">And on page 128, on 128 of the transcript, the last -- the paragraph of the statement given to Mr. Barrera personally because he -- he claims that he admitted under writ and he admits now that he was there at the time of the statement was given and he says here on the next to the last paragraph, one thing I went with, that's Castilleja talking to Mr. Barrera, the prosecutor, when the man first walked to the car, that is when he ran to get in the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="7074.291" offset="28297091">He cursed Herlinda, he said and then the words in Spanish (Inaudible), yet that the scale which means literally, (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="7085.395" offset="28341499">Now, I've caught you.</text>
            <text syncTime="7087.367" offset="28349440">Now the -- notice the interpretation given by Castilleja, you bitch, I caught you leaving out the word "now".</text>
            <text syncTime="7094.962" offset="28379847">Now, going back to the cross examination of Mr. Barrera, I think Justice Warren addressed that issue clearly when he interrogated Mr. Barrera about the -- the cross examination when Alcorta divulged that he knew or suspected and he caught him kissing and he felt and believed at that particular time that they were making love or having a date up and that compounded with the fact that Alcorta had made a statement corroborating the belief that he had caught her.</text>
            <text syncTime="7138.051" offset="28552150">Now, this statement was never introduced in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="7140.645" offset="28562495">Now, in the -- in the testimony itself, the transcript of page 155, it was sort of watered down.</text>
            <text syncTime="7151.806" offset="28607216">The testimony was given as Castilleja said, "I caught you."</text>
            <text syncTime="7158.412" offset="28633548">He didn't say the -- the profanity, he didn't say, “now.”</text>
            <text syncTime="7162.420" offset="28649639">I believe that -- that it could have very well given -- taken home the message to Mr. Barrera that then he could've realized that Alcorta knew about this intercourse and at that time, the issue was very material as the issue of murder without malice was submitted to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="7183.128" offset="28732500">For that reason, we ask the Court to reverse the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7186.158" offset="28744620">Thank you.</text>
