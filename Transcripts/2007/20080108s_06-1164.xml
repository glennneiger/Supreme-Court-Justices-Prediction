            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104580">The statute of limitations that governs this case is a special statute aimed just to the Court of Federal Claims and it has â€“ it's a six-year statute in the actions timely only if it's brought within six years after the time that litigants claim accrues.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.015" offset="172603">Now, here in the lower courts, United States in effect conceded that the litigant's claim was timely and when it got to the Court of Appeals, the United States said nothing about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.242" offset="217533">Normally, if a litigant doesn't say anything about it, it's waived, but here, the appellate court raised the timeliness issue on its own, and decided that the litigant was out of luck, his claim was too late.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.425" offset="270196">So, we have to decide, even though the normal rule is if the Government will defend as defendant says nothing about the matter, it's waived, forget it, we have to decide whether the particular statute at issue here, this Court of Claims statute is special in this respect and it requires a dismissal of an untimely claim even though the defendant never said anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.752" offset="359535">That's how we take the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.680" offset="367267">Now, we hold that the statute of limitations governing the Court of claims is special and it does require the dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.993" offset="400495">Well, why?</text>
            <text syncTime="75.079" offset="404884">Because in a string of cases beginning in 1883, the Court has basically said that and held that.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.940" offset="432260">For example, a long time ago, hundred -- more than a hundred years ago, it said it is the duty of the Court of claims to raise the limitations question whether in effect, the defendant did this, raised it or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.047" offset="480743">The petitioner says that we overturn these cases in Irwin Versus Department of Veterans Affairs, a case we decided in 1990.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.787" offset="515643">We agree with the petitioner that Irwin does take a different approach towards interpreting statute of limitations affecting the Government, but we don't agree that Irwin overruled our earlier cases interpreting this particular statute nor do we think we should now overrule those earlier cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.261" offset="593592">It may be that when you look at Irwin and then you look at the earlier cases, the earlier cases do seem anomalous, but still, principles of stare decisis convince us we should not overturn.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.806" offset="647718">Justice Brandeis once observed that in most matters, it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it'd be settled right.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.239" offset="693484">And to overturn a set of decisions settling one matter of the kind that Justice Brandeis was talking about, simply because we might believe that that decision is no longer right and we can get a better one now, would inevitably reflect the willingness to reconsider other matters of the same kind and that willingness could itself threaten to substitute disruption and confusion and uncertainty for what the law needs in terms of stability.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.901" offset="804139">We find nothing in this case sufficient to overcome these general considerations and for that reason, we affirm the Court of Appeals decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.128" offset="841024">Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion which Justice Ginsberg has joined and Justice Ginsburg has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
