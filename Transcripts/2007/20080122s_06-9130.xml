            <label>Justice Clarence Thomas</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104695">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.517" offset="134684">Petitioner's personal property was allegedly lost when he transferred or when he was transferred from one prison facility to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.204" offset="173449">After exhausting his administrative remedies, petitioner sued the Bureau of Prisons under the Federal Tort Claims Act seeking $177, the value of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.182" offset="229351">The Federal Tort Claims Act waives sovereign immunity for torts committed by federal employees, however, Congress accepted from this waiver claims arising in respect of the detention of any property by any officer of customs or excise or any other law enforcement officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.884" offset="328199">The District Court held that petitioner's claim fell within this exemption and dismissed his claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.770" offset="359755">The Eleventh Circuit affirmed agreeing that the exemption is not limited to law enforcement officers enforcing customs or excise laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.189" offset="401446">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.014" offset="424747">The text and structure of Section 2680(c) are most naturally read to encompass all law enforcement officers regardless of whether they are enforcing customs or excise laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.578" offset="486919">Congress' use of the expansive word “any” to modify other law enforcement officer and it's omission of any restrictive language demonstrate that it intended the exemption to apply to law enforcement officers of whatever kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.445" offset="562465">To be sure, the clause preserves immunity for claims arising from officers enforcing tax or customs laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.690" offset="595379">But the text also indicates that Congress intended to preserve immunity for property detentions claims like the one at issue here, and there is no textual basis for limiting that immunity to officers enforcing certain kinds of laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.137" offset="669149">Recent amendments to Section 2680(c) support our conclusion because the amended statute is more consistent and coherent if it is read to cover all law enforcement officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.247" offset="725678">Against this textual and structural evidence, petitioner appeals the canons of statutory construction, but those canons cannot be invoked to clarify ambiguity where the statutes suggest none.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.518" offset="782729">Instead, we must give effect to the text that Congress enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.836" offset="799970">Section 2680(c) forecloses lawsuits against the United States for the unlawful detention of property by any, not just some law enforcement officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.743" offset="851588">Justice Kennedy has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Stevens, Souter and Breyer have joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.755" offset="887637">Justice Breyer has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Stevens has joined.</text>
