            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104709">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.548" offset="134802">Like the previous two cases, it pertains to that considerable part of our business which consists of sorting out the relationship between federal law and state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.637" offset="195197">This case involves the major federal statute governing medical devices known as the Medical Device Amendments Act of 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.791" offset="231873">Before that law was passed, regulation of medical devices was left almost entirely to the States and common law tort actions were the principle method of ensuring that manufacturers did not market dangerous or ineffective medical devices.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.551" offset="302822">The Medical Device Amendments Act changed this.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.471" offset="318495">It created a detailed scheme of federal oversight.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.535" offset="338766">The law divides medical devices into three groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.299" offset="353813">Class III, the group relevant to this case contains devices subject to particularly searching safety review, including the process known as pre-market approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.336" offset="405953">Some Class III devices are exempt from the process, but manufacturers of the remaining Class III devices, which include the device at issue here, may not market their products until they receive approval from the Food and Drug Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.827" offset="471991">Manufacturers submit to the agency, what is typically a multivolume application, including among other things, a description of the devices designed and how it will be manufactured, a specimen of the device's proposed labeling and the contents of any -- any and all known studies concerning the device.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.494" offset="562583">The Food and Drug Administration spends an average of 1200 hours reviewing each application.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.411" offset="594348">It approves an application only if it finds there is a "reasonable assurance" of the devices' safety and effectiveness under the specifications in the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.750" offset="643667">It lays the benefits of the device against its risks.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.226" offset="661535">This means that it -- that it approves some devices that are very risky indeed, where for example, they provide the only hope for remedying an otherwise fatal condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.657" offset="707302">Once a device has been approved, the manufacturer may not make changes that would affect the devices' safety or effectiveness without returning to the agency for another round of safety review.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.097" offset="761009">When Congress added to the authority of federal regulators through the Medical Device Amendments, it took away authority from the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.524" offset="794760">The law provides that no State shall "establish or continue in effect with respect to a device intended for human use" any requirement which is different from or in addition to any requirement applicable to the device under federal law and which relates to the safety or effectiveness of the device.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.064" offset="892876">Thus, when the Federal Government requires that a device be marketed in -- in one form, a State may not require that the device be marketed in a different form.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.647" offset="935194">In this case, petitioner, Donna Riegel and her husband Charles Riegel, filed a lawsuit against respondent, Medtronic Inc., under New York tort law.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.236" offset="977617">Charles Riegel had been seriously injured when a catheter manufactured by Medtronic burst during heart surgery.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.450" offset="1014502">The catheter was a Class III medical device that had received pre-market approval from the Food and Drug Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.223" offset="1045535">The Riegels contended that even if the catheter was manufactured in accordance with specifications that the agency had approved, the device was unsafe and improperly labeled under New York law.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.561" offset="1098929">They contended as relevant here that Medtronic was liable under the State's common law rules of strict liability, implied warranty, and negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.370" offset="1138113">Mr. Riegel has since died and his wife presses his claims as administrator of his estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.507" offset="1162668">She argues that the preemption clause bars only state regulatory provisions and not common law claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.205" offset="1197463">The Second Circuit disagreed, and so do we.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.997" offset="1212614">The whole purpose of the Food and Drug Administration's review is to determine the appropriate balance between risks and benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.082" offset="1245006">When state common law rules permit a jury to recalculate that balance, the federal scheme is frustrated, no less than when a state regulatory scheme takes the same action.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.235" offset="1289623">Indeed, leaving the recalculation to a jury on a case-by-case basis is arguably even worse.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.219" offset="1321493">Since the jury has before it, only the injured plaintiff and no one speaks for those who would be deprived of the benefits of the admittedly risky device, if manufacturers could not rely upon FDA approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.895" offset="1376245">As I have described, States are prohibited for maintaining requirements with respect to approved devices that are "different from, or in addition to" the federal requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.579" offset="1426923">In the last analysis, common law claims rest upon state law requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.539" offset="1450851">They are premised on the existence of state law duty and a tort judgment represents a determination that a defendant violated that duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.846" offset="1492020">We have, therefore, treated other statutes that preempts state requirements as preempting state common law obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.323" offset="1521904">Congress is entitled to know what meaning this Court will assign to terms regular -- regularly used in its enactments and we see no reason to give the word requirements a different meaning here.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.072" offset="1572895">Petitioner contends that the Medical Device Amendments preempt only state duties that relate exclusively to medical devices.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.512" offset="1606750">By its terms, however, the statute preempts any requirement "continued in effect with respect to" a medical device without regard to whether the requirement is also continued in effect with respect to other products.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.075" offset="1672996">Petitioner pins her narrower view of preemption on a regulation of the Food and Drug Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.067" offset="1696925">The agency itself, however, does not interpret its regulation in that fashion and parts of the regulation make little sense unless the preemption clause is understood to apply to general common law duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.056" offset="1748856">In the last analysis, we conclude that the regulation neither assists nor contradicts our interpretation of the statutory text.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.034" offset="1784800">Accordingly, the decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.995" offset="1800683">Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.497" offset="1822626">Justice Ginsburg has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
