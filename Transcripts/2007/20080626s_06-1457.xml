            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104710">Justice Scalia has the opinion of the Court in page 06-1457, Morgan Stanley Capital Group versus Public Utility District and the consolidated case, 06-1462, American Electric Power versus Public Utility District.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="17.438" offset="174405">These consolidated cases come to us on a writ of certiorari to the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.731" offset="195616">Like most cases involving the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), they are very complicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.269" offset="229784">They concern the interaction between an old administrative law doctrine and a new regulatory regime.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.613" offset="259146">The old administrative law doctrine is called the Mobile-Sierra doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.217" offset="277536">Under the Federal Power Act, companies that sell electricity at wholesale to purchasers such as state and local public utilities, must file a tariff with the -- with FERC, setting out the rates that they will charge to buyers, generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.189" offset="349425">And the Commission determines whether those rates are, to use the statutory term, “just and reasonable”.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.776" offset="375757">Traditionally, in reviewing these rates, FERC ensured that wholesalers receive a fair rate of return on their investment, but no more.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.775" offset="411806">Aside from tariffs, the Federal Power Act also permits wholesalers to set rates with individual purchasers through bilateral contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.321" offset="449944">So, a wholesaler and a purchasing public utility may agree by contract to a rate different from what the wholesaler charges other purchasers under its tariff, and can lock that rate in for a period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.145" offset="505219">Those contracts must be filed with FERC before they go into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.844" offset="524028">Under the Mobile-Sierra doctrine, the name comes from two of the cases in this Court in 1956, under that doctrine, FERC must presume that these rates set by freely negotiated contracts between sophisticated wholesalers and public utilities, are just and reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.756" offset="611694">The premise being, that these sophisticated parties can be expected to negotiate a just and reasonable rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.774" offset="643773">Only where the rate seriously harms the public interest, may FERC and must FERC, set it aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.470" offset="674493">So, that's the old administrative law doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.427" offset="686405">The new regulatory regime is a recent FERC innovation called market-based tariffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.430" offset="714408">A market-based tariff does not set out rates like traditional tariffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.015" offset="732694">Rather, it allows the seller to enter into freely negotiated contracts with buyers in the energy market.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.941" offset="760383">To qualify for a market-based tariff, a seller of electricity, a wholesaler, must show that it does not have excessive market power.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.517" offset="798731">The key aspect of the market-based tariff, for purposes of this case, is that the contracts entered into under them do not have to be filed with FERC before they go into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.653" offset="847319">Instead, the wholesaler periodically reports to FERC after the fact, all contracts that it entered into.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.063" offset="876890">FERC believes that the Federal Power Act's requirement that all rates be filed first with the Commission is satisfied by the filing of the market-based tariff itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.853" offset="924119">In these cases, respondents are Western Utilities that entered into long-term contracts with petitioner wholesalers that had market-based tariffs on file with FERC.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.304" offset="969886">The contracts set rates that were very high, by historical standards, because at the time, short-term prices in the Western United States had spiked to very high levels due to a variety of economic, natural and regulatory factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.033" offset="1044805">After that period of high prices had passed, the respondents here, having buyers' remorse, asked FERC to modify the contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.590" offset="1087019">But FERC refused after determining under Mobile-Sierra that the public interest was not seriously harmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.912" offset="1116276">Respondents petitioned to the Ninth Circuit which granted the petitions for review and remanded to FERC on two alternative grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.081" offset="1148981">First, the Ninth Circuit thought that because contracts entered into under market-based tariffs are never initially filed with the Commission, they are not entitled to the Mobile-Sierra presumption of validity, a presumption that their rates are just and reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.895" offset="1212197">In other words, the Ninth Circuit thought that the Mobile-Sierra presumption does not apply to FERC's first review of a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.024" offset="1252739">Second, the Ninth Circuit held that even if the Mobile-Sierra presumption did apply, the standard for a challenge by a purchaser, the utilities here, is lower than the standard for a seller's challenge, namely, for the buyer, the standard is merely whether the contract causes consumer rates to exceed a zone of reasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.585" offset="1359006">So far are you with me, right? [Laughter]</text>
            <text syncTime="319.552" offset="1382829">In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we conclude that the Ninth Circuit was wrong on both counts, but that FERC committed other errors in applying the Mobile-Sierra doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.174" offset="1421386">We, therefore, affirm the decision below on alternative grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.891" offset="1436223">Why was the Ninth Circuit wrong?</text>
            <text syncTime="334.819" offset="1443956">First, the Mobile-Sierra doctrine does not apply only where FERC has had an initial opportunity to review the contract without the presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.105" offset="1473108">Rather, it defines how the statutory just and reasonable standard applies in the contract -- in the context of contracts, no matter when they are challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.036" offset="1520756">Second, the standard for a purchase whose challenge is the same generally speaking is the standard for a seller's challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.261" offset="1545729">The contract to be invalidated must seriously harm the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.806" offset="1567881">Over the last 50 years, this Court, lower courts and the Commission have understood the standard to be a high one.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.704" offset="1591495">We have described it for instance as, “unequivocal public necessity”.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.740" offset="1615632">FERC, thus, was correct both to apply the Mobile-Sierra standard and to treat the standard as a high one.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.094" offset="1644994">Nevertheless, we find two defects in FERC's analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.888" offset="1660250">First, it is unclear whether FERC examined the impact of the contracts on the consuming public, in light of the rates consumers could have obtained, today, in the absence of the contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.266" offset="1717719">It seems that FERC may have simply looked to whether the contracts increased consumer rates immediately upon going into effect at the time when all of the prices were spiked.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.437" offset="1758366">Second, respondents allege that the petitioners engaged in unlawful market manipulation in the spot market that affected the long-term contracts at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.439" offset="1802460">FERC dismissed this allegation as irrelevant because the contract rates were not so high as to violate the public interest, but we conclude that if a party engaged in unlawful market activity that had an impact on the contract, the contract is not entitled to Mobile-Sierra presumption because it cannot be said to be the product of arm's length negotiations.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.775" offset="1895770">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.761" offset="1907681">Justice Ginsburg has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.652" offset="1927221">Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion which Justice Souter has joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.116" offset="1945089">Neither -- neither the Chief Justice nor Justice Breyer took any part in the consideration or decision of these cases.</text>
