            <text syncTime="11.810" offset="209191">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The issue in this case is whether DWI is a violent felony for purposes of an Armed Career Criminal Act sentencing enhancement.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.618" offset="256421">Sentencing enhancement takes the statutory sentencing range from zero to 10 years and raises it to 15 years to life.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.959" offset="289753">The intent of the Armed Career Criminal Act is to punish most severely that category of recidivist violent offenders who are disproportionately responsible for the violent crimes and who, when they possess a weapon, are more dangerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.371" offset="379405">The government is trying to expand the reach of the statute by so broadly reading the residual clause as to include any crime that presents a serious potential risk of injury to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.941" offset="445652">Such a reading of that residual clause would swallow the entire statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.847" offset="465296">Congress had no intention of including DWI within the ambit of the Armed Career Criminal Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="105.882" offset="585459">Let's take two crimes and imagine that the same number of people injured or killed is identical for the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.333" offset="623284">One let's say is burglary and the other is driving under the influence.</text>

            <text syncTime="128.279" offset="675007">When I wrote that opinion, it seemed to me that there still is an important difference between the two crimes that is controlling here.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.073" offset="714191">But if you look at what I wrote, I didn't articulate that difference very well.</text>

            <text syncTime="184.475" offset="899764">But in addition to that, they're all property crimes, as this Court said in Taylor.</text>

            <text syncTime="1614.753" offset="6620894">And we have to recall that the ACCA contains two requirements for treatment for prior conviction as a violent felony that would support enhanced sentencing under that act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1634.058" offset="6698112">As a general matter, crimes of ordinary negligence, simple carelessness, or totally blameworthy acts don't merit felony punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.290" offset="6731026">As this Court recognized in Staples, to label a criminal act as a felony is indeed a serious thing and something that legislatures, by long tradition, reserved for truly serious acts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1680.024" offset="6882014">And also because the conduct that's defined by the DUI statute of New Mexico, as well as other States, by definition defines conduct that is unsafe.</text>

            <text syncTime="2964.747" offset="12020927">Well, if the Court decided to reach that issue in this case, even though the issue was not pressed or passed on in the court of appeals and wasn't raised in the cert petition, we do think the Court's analysis of the issue in that case applies equally to its analysis of the issue of whether or not the felony prong of the definition of "violent felony" is applicable in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.927" offset="12097622">So were the Court to decide that the applicable maximum term of imprisonment that applies to a recidivist is the term of imprisonment that would apply to a hypothetical first-time offender, then that decision would control in this case as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.232" offset="12162824">And the Court should dispose of this case accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.044" offset="12174109">But it bears noting that that would not dispose of this question entirely, because there are, of course, other reasons why States treat drunk driving offenses as felony offenses, particularly in situations in which they result in serious bodily harm or death to another, as Your Honor previously noted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.834" offset="12241296">The issue in this case comes down to the interpretation of the statute that Congress wrote, not a hypothetical statute that Congress could have written.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.174" offset="12290615">And that statute identifies one criterion for determining whether or not a felony offense qualifies as a violent felony under the ACCA, and that is its potential for harming other human beings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.808" offset="12341188">Drunk driving is commonly understood to present a serious potential risks of injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.118" offset="12358429">The potential risks of injury are the only reason why it's a crime under the laws of 50 States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.757" offset="12384969">And the risks associated with drunk driving are comparable in both kind and degree to the risks associated with arson and explosives use, two crimes that Congress specifically identified in the statute as satisfying its definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.347" offset="12431258">For that reason, we think that the court of appeals correctly determined that Mr. Begay was sentenced properly under the Armed Career Criminal Act and would urge the Court to affirm its determination.</text>
