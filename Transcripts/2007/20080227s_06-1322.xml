            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104729">This case arises under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, the ADEA.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.159" offset="133359">The petitioner, Federal Express Corporation, as is well-known here and around the world, provides mail pickup and delivery services to customers worldwide.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.908" offset="164288">Respondents are 14 current and former FedEx couriers over the age of 40.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.156" offset="185291">They filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.549" offset="202845">FedEx had implemented productivity initiatives that tied the courier's compensation and continued employment to certain performance, benchmarks, for instance the number of stops a courier makes per day and respondents claim these initiatives violated the ADA -- ADEA.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.437" offset="286437">Our opinion today simply addresses a procedural problem and not that main substantive issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.660" offset="311305">The question before us is the timeliness of the suit filed by one of the plaintiffs below referred to as the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.441" offset="334398">The District Court granted motion -- petitioner's motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.973" offset="348608">It found that the respondent had not filed an EEOC charge before she commenced the suit in court and this did not meet the statutory requirement according to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.026" offset="388732">The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.653" offset="399286">We granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.043" offset="404824">We now affirm the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.437" offset="414437">The case presents two distinct questions, what is a charge as the ADA uses -- ADEA uses that term and were the documents respondent filed in December 2001, a charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.467" offset="466577">The petitioner urges -- the employer urges as to condition the definition of charge enhance an employee's ability to sue upon the EEOC's fulfilling a mandatory duty to notify the charged party and initiate a conciliation process.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.201" offset="533451">Respondent argues that a charge need contain only an allegation of discrimination and the name of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.408" offset="558319">The EEOC submits that the proper test for determining whether a filing as a charge is whether the filing taken as a whole, should be construed as a request by the employee for the agency to take whatever action is necessary to vindicate her rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.171" offset="613385">The EEOC has adopted this position in the Governmentâ€™s amicus brief and in various internal policy directives that it is issued to its fielded officers over the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.996" offset="660615">And in our view, the agency's policy statements interpret not only the regulations, but also the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.922" offset="684334">Assuming these interpretive statements are not entitled full Chevron deference, they are entitled to a measure of respect under the less deferential, Skidmore standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.286" offset="721846">The agency's interpretation is and its interpretative position is consistent with the statutory framework and we conclude as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.956" offset="756536">In addition to the information required by the regulations, that is to say an -- an allegation in the name of the charged party, if a filing is to be deemed a charge, it must be reasonably construed as a request for the agency to take remedial action to protect the employees' rights, or otherwise settle the dispute between the employer and the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.672" offset="831351">The next question is whether the filing here meets that test?</text>
            <text syncTime="184.742" offset="843681">The agency says it does, we agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.785" offset="855802">Respondent's completed intake form contained all of the -- information outlined in the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.774" offset="879730">And the Affidavit that the respondent submitted along with the form is properly construed as a request for the agency to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.508" offset="906688">The employer's interest in this case were given a short shrift, for it was not notified of the complaint until the employee filed a suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.885" offset="940229">The Court adheres the merits of this litigation, can attempt to remedy of the deficiency by staying the proceedings to allow an opportunity for conciliation and settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.695" offset="975442">But the ultimate responsibility for establishing a clearer, more consistent process lies with the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.123" offset="997176">We affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, Justice Thomas has filed a dissenting opinion in which Scalia has joined.</text>
