            <text syncTime="8.247" offset="195415">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Mr. Watson's receipt of a firearm in exchange for drugs does not constitute the use of that firearm as the word 18 U.S.C. Section 924(c)(1) for two principal reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.974" offset="258318">First, applying the plain and ordinary meaning of the word "use", the receipt of a thing is not the use of that thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.379" offset="287993">There is no grammatically proper way to say that someone uses a firearm when all that person does is receive it.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.500" offset="316414">Second, treating receipt as use under the statute conflicts with this Court's decision in Bailey v. United States, which held that use requires active employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.138" offset="359046">And I'll address those two points in turn.</text>

            <text syncTime="60.523" offset="404499">I believe receipt does constitute possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.008" offset="414530">However, of course, possession standing alone under this Court's decision in Bailey does not constitute use.</text>

            <label>Mr. Karl J. Koch</label>

            <text syncTime="80.436" offset="484225">That... that was not charged in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.341" offset="495823">And I would suggest that the... that the circumstances of this case might not call that into... into play simply because his possession really was... was incidental, and it was following the conclusion of the drug transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.414" offset="552143">So I think... I question whether the possession in furtherance would necessarily apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.224" offset="571370">Of course, it was not charged.</text>

            <text syncTime="104.364" offset="579938">I have the same question as Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.722" offset="589342">It seems to me, absent some precedents which narrows this definition, that that would have been the way to charge your client.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.217" offset="635317">That's not what was charged; that's not the indictment; that's not what you're arguing.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.029" offset="646602">So I guess the question is more appropriate for the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.373" offset="655902">But, if, following Justice Ginsburg's question, this covers it, and it seems to me that it does, then we're not arguing about very much.</text>

            <text syncTime="135.430" offset="704176">My only point, again, would be, that recognizing that "in furtherance", at least by the authors of that language, would suggest it to mean something more than "in relation to, ".</text>
            <text syncTime="146.285" offset="747539">I think the question could legitimately be asked in a... in a transaction like this, where the possession basically is what he was attempting to achieve and did, in fact, achieve, but after the... at the end transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.092" offset="794769">I don't... I can't answer whether or not, ultimately, that would be... deemed to be in furtherance or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="164.841" offset="821832">Mr. Koch, let's say that the parties to the transaction are concerned about avoiding exposure under the money-laundering statute, and so they got together and said: All right, we are going to have this deal.</text>

            <text syncTime="177.195" offset="871255">And they say: Well, let's use guns, or let's use a gun.</text>

Section 924(c)(1) giving it, as this Court held in Smith, its plain and ordinary meaning, the example that was used by the D.C. Circuit in United States v. Stewart, I thought, was appropriate, where... the coffee shop example, where you have the... the individual buying the coffee, and you have the cashier.</text>

            <text syncTime="739.468" offset="3120294">"It's undeniable the active employment reading of use restricts the scope of 924(c)(1). "</text>

            <text syncTime="746.699" offset="3149237">Bailey held that use requires active employment, not only in general but by the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.073" offset="3170762">More importantly perhaps to this case, Bailey held that possession alone is not use, and here Mr. Watson was trying to achieve possession, but... and ultimately when he did get possession, he had it instantaneously.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.755" offset="3237427">So looking at it from a temporal standpoint, first he receives the gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.473" offset="3256339">Before that point he doesn't have possession, so he doesn't even rise to the level of Bailey.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.768" offset="3269505">After that point, all he did was possess it for an instant, still not enough, I'd suggest, to qualify as active employment or use under Bailey, the most recent definition that we have available.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.155" offset="3315063">There's an argument presented by the government that feeds off of Smith's use of 924(d) which I wanted to mention briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.586" offset="3360829">The... and that is the... the importation of the definition of the term 924(d), the forfeiture provision of the statute, into 924(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="810.254" offset="3403461">In Smith, the Court held that there were predicate offenses for 924(d) in which the only way that the weapon could be used was in a non-weapon use, which is what the Court was concerned about in the Smith case, and therefore the Court found, looking at those predicate offenses that had non-weapon uses only, that therefore the term 924(d) must include non-weapon use.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.228" offset="3503353">That logic, however... and that's the argument made by the government... that doesn't translate into the situation we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.413" offset="3528117">It's addressed, by the way, on page 9 of our reply brief in some detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.022" offset="3542537">I'll talk about it briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.693" offset="3549224">First of all, 924(d) is a forfeiture provision and the focus there necessarily is on the firearm, not on the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.721" offset="3581303">The language in 924(d) is, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="858.344" offset="3595827">"any firearm or ammunition intended to be used in one of the predicate offenses. "</text>
            <text syncTime="862.890" offset="3614008">That's compared with 924(c), which states</text>
            <text syncTime="866.356" offset="3627905">"any person who during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime uses or carries a firearm. "</text>
            <text syncTime="872.369" offset="3651938">So you have firearm intended to be used on the one hand, versus a person who uses a firearm.</text>

            <text syncTime="950.135" offset="3963004">The... in, in Smith, the Court reached the opinion it did about the meaning of the term "use" only because there were, there were predicate offenses in which the only uses available were nonweapons uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.534" offset="4028623">By contrast, here the predicate offenses that are suggested to import this definition of "use", there aren't any predicate offenses in which the only way to commit the offense is through receipt.</text>

            <text syncTime="3098.269" offset="12555513">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.959" offset="12558334">As... as I indicated before I don't think that it's necessary to overrule Smith to rule for the Petitioner, but if... if consistency on both sides of the transaction is desired and certainly something has to go, I would suggest it ought to be Smith because otherwise you're stuck with Bailey and with what I suggest are settled principles of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.654" offset="12649032">The... I think Smith takes... takes it about as far as it could go, and you're having to make... you have to make a number of linguistic compromises to get to the Smith result to begin with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.632" offset="12700963">The... with regard to the... the charging as possession or furtherance or not, again it's not before us, it's not part of this case I would suggest that Mr. Watson possessed this firearm as a consequence of a drug transaction rather than in furtherance of a drug transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.923" offset="12762090">I do think, and it's obvious from other statutes in the neighborhood, that Congress certainly knows how to say "receive" and "accept" and words of that nature, if it was its intent to... to make the receipt of a weapon or bring that within the ambit of this... of this particular statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.885" offset="12837949">I don't think it's enough to say, as my opponent does, use as a medium of exchange if it's a crime for example to use a forged instrument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.583" offset="12880790">The guy who accepts it doesn't use it, I don't think by any reasonable interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.394" offset="12900016">So I think that that... that really stretches this farther than it should go.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.923" offset="12922168">Lastly, I would point out, and again this is in our brief around page 9, with respect to this 924(d) argument, one of the predicate offenses that's used in 924(d) is 922(j), which includes language</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.043" offset="12978592">"it shall be unlawful for any person to receive, possess, conceal, store, barter, sell, or dispose of. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.477" offset="13004401">et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.243" offset="13007432">Well, 922(j), yet we know from Bailey that "possess" in and of itself can't be a use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.629" offset="13040973">And that's just one of the reasons why that argument unfortunately falls apart when one is trying to import those definitions of use into this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.892" offset="13073992">I have nothing further.</text>
