            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104530">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the First Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3.419" offset="118114">Petitioner Myrna Gomez-Perez was a window distribution clerk for the United States Postal Service in Dorado, Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.022" offset="152595">In 2002, when she was 45 years of age, she requested and was granted a transfer to another branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.350" offset="181852">When she later requested a transfer back to her original position, her request was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.188" offset="205258">After filing an unsuccessful grievance with her union, petitioner filed an equal opportunity complaint with the postal service alleging that the denial of the transfer was the product of age discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.223" offset="257399">According to petitioner, she was thereafter subjected to various forms of retaliation, including having her job hours reduced. Petitioner responded by filing this suit claiming that the postal service had violated the federal-sector provision of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act by retaliating against her for filing an equal opportunity age discrimination complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.518" offset="350499">The federal-sector provision states that "all personnel actions affecting employees or applicants for employment who are at least 40 years of age shall be made free from discrimination based on age.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.050" offset="400654">The First Circuit held that the prohibition of discrimination based on age does not cover retaliation for filing an age discrimination complaint and affirmed the dismissal of petitioner's complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.903" offset="448092">We granted certiorari and now reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.612" offset="458959">In interpreting the phrase discrimination based on age, we are guided by our prior decisions in Sullivan versus Little Hunting Park and Jackson versus Birmingham Board of Education.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.361" offset="505875">In Sullivan, we interpreted 42 U.S.C. Section 1982 which prohibits discrimination based on race and property transactions and we found that Section 1982 prohibits retaliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.791" offset="559688">More recently, in Jackson, we interpreted Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. Section 1681 which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in educational programs, receiving federal financial assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.608" offset="622904">Relying on Sullivan, we held that this is ban on discrimination on the basis of sex, likewise prohibits retaliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.037" offset="656654">Following the reasoning of Sullivan and Jackson, we interpret the ADEA's federal-sector provisions, prohibition of discrimination based on age as likewise proscribing retaliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.106" offset="708899">The statutory language at issue here is not materially different from the language that we construed in Jackson and it's the functional equivalent of the statutory language in Sullivan.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.066" offset="752785">Moreover, the statutory context is the same in all three cases, remedial provisions aimed at prohibiting discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.445" offset="782251">For this reason and others setout in an opinion filed today with the clerk, we reverse the decision of the First Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.850" offset="803880">The Chief Justice has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Scalia and Thomas have joined in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.084" offset="828853">Justice Thomas has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Scalia has joined.</text>
