            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104647">The federal statutes create the position of United States Magistrate Judge and the statutes prescribe their duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.941" offset="136307">Magistrate Judges are not appointed pursuant to Article 3 of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.370" offset="154071">And in earlier cases, we've addressed whether they can perform certain duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.520" offset="174655">The statute that's involved here says that they can perform "additional duties that are not inconsistent with the constitution and laws."</text>
            <text syncTime="26.405" offset="210182">Our earlier cases established that Magistrate Judges can preside at the jury selection phase and conduct voir dire in a felony criminal case, provided there is consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.562" offset="250828">And this case requires us to decide whose consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.802" offset="263785">Can counsel alone give consent? Or must the defendant give his or her own consent?</text>
            <text syncTime="45.799" offset="287818">The petitioner was charged in United States District Court on five felony drug offense counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.404" offset="306208">Now, at the outset of the jury selection phase, the parties appeared before a Magistrate Judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.486" offset="322508">The Magistrate Judge asked the attorneys to approach the bench and after they complied, the Magistrate said, "I need to ask the parties at this time if they are going to consent to having United States Magistrate Judge, i.e. me, and preside in assisting the jury selection of this case."</text>
            <text syncTime="71.598" offset="390949">The petitioner's counsel responded, "Yes, Your Honor, we are."</text>
            <text syncTime="74.947" offset="404428">Petitioner himself was not asked if he consented to the Magistrate Judge's presiding, the petitioner was in the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.439" offset="430342">The record does not permit us to infer this or even to infer that the petitioner knew there was a right to be waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.366" offset="466077">The petitioner made no objections to the Magistrate Judges ruling on the voir dires and selection phase.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.218" offset="485512">The District judge then presided at the jury trial and the jury returned the verdict of guilty on all counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.827" offset="507873">Petitioner appealed and he contended for the first time that it was error not to obtain his own consent to the Magistrate Judges presiding at voir dire.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.754" offset="539638">The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit disagreed and affirmed the convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.852" offset="556043">We agree with the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.446" offset="562417">We find no error here.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.906" offset="568268">We hold the petitioner's counsel had full authority to consent to the Magistrate Judge's role.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.003" offset="592614">As a general matter, when there is a full trial, there are various points in the pretrial and trial process when rights either can be asserted or waived, and there is support in our cases for concluding that some of these rights cannot be waived absent the defendant's own consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.326" offset="657920">Although there are basic rights that the attorney cannot waive without the fully inform and publicly acknowledged consent of the client.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.494" offset="682580">The lawyer has and must have full authority to manage the conduct of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.507" offset="702642">Acceptance of the Magistrate Judge at the jury selection phase is a tactical decision, that is well-suited for the attorney's own decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.754" offset="735661">The judges' particular approach to voir dire both in substance, that is to say that the questions asked and in tone, formal or informal, maybe relevant in light of the attorney's own approach, requiring personal on the record approval from the client could necessitate a lengthy explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.024" offset="800654">The client might not understand at the moment and that might distract for more pressing matters as the attorney seeks to prepare the best defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.954" offset="832418">Consent from an attorney will therefore suffice.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.757" offset="843599">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.194" offset="853421">Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.741" offset="867527">Justice Thomas has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
