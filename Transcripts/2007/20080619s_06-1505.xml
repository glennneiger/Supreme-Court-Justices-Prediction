            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104745">Justice Souter has our opinion this morning in case 06-1505, Meacham versus Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="8.318" stopTime="263.158">
            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="8.318" offset="137973">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari of the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.585" offset="155005">The Nation's fleet of nuclear-powered submarines is maintained in part by the government's private contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.295" offset="181858">One such contractor, Knolls, the respondent here, runs a government laboratory.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.255" offset="209757">As the Cold War wound down in the 1990s, the Government ordered Knolls to cut its workforce.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.522" offset="234730">Knolls laid off 31 salaried employees of whom 30 were at least 40 years old, old enough to be covered by the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the ADEA which was also the subject of Justice Breyer's Kentucky opinion a moment ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.733" offset="311635">The petitioners including Clifford Meacham were among those workers laid off.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.703" offset="335458">They sued under the ADEA and won a jury verdict on their claim that Knolls' lay off procedures had a disparate impact that is a discriminatory effect on older workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.836" offset="384046">But the Second Circuit reversed and ruled in favor of Knolls saying that Meacham and the other plaintiffs had not satisfied the burden of persuasion in rebutting the defense, that the criteria Knolls used in its lay off decisions were reasonable ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.781" offset="447785">That defense is laid out in the Section 4 (f) (1) of the ADEA which says that -- and I am quoting, “It shall not be unlawful for an employer to take any action otherwise prohibited by the Act, where the differentiation is based on reasonable factors other than age.”</text>
            <text syncTime="105.019" offset="524794">This is referred to as the RFOA defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.023" offset="540781">There is no dispute that the employer bears the burden of producing evidence to raise this defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.352" offset="566067">We granted certiorari to answer only the question whether the employer also bears the burden of persuading the fact finder on the merits of the defense, or whether as the Court of Appeals assumed that task falls to the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.413" offset="622387">In an opinion filed with the clerk of court today, we vacate and remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.737" offset="639628">We hold that an employer looking to take advantage of the RFOA exemption bears not only the burden of production, but also the burden of persuasion on that defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.914" offset="684350">Most lawyers would find this to be no surprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.309" offset="697934">In the text of the statute, the RFOA clause sits in a provision not only separate from the ones that create liability, but one that also refers to the conduct that exempts as actions otherwise prohibited by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.807" offset="755925">A familiar principle in reading statutes tells us in the words of Justice Holmes, that “when a proviso carves an exception out of the body of a statute, those who set up the exception must prove it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="174.659" offset="803364">This longstanding convention is a part of the backdrop against which the Congress writes its laws and so we follow it, too, unless we see clear signs that Congress meant the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.233" offset="845578">In fact, our past cases have already recognized that the clause right next to the RFOA clause creates an affirmative defense with the burden of persuasion falling on the employer, and in this case we have been given no good reason to treat the RFOA clause any differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.869" offset="916213">In going the other way, the Court of Appeals took its queue from the employee's burden of persuasion on the question of whether an employer's practice is a business necessity, a tests the courts had applied under Title VII before it was amended in 1991.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.695" offset="987475">But the business necessity test has no use in ADEA disparate impact cases where it would be largely redundant and in some ways incompatible with the statutory RFOA defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.866" offset="1036167">And because our prior cases about the business necessity test have nothing to do with statutory defenses either in the old Title VII or -- or in the ADEA, they do not disturb our natural reading of the RFOA clause as creating an affirmative defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.903" offset="1100324">For these reasons, we vacate the Second Circuit's opinion and remand for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.901" offset="1120281">Justice Thomas has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.390" offset="1138254">Justice Breyer took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</text>
