            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104720">Justice Stevens has the opinion for the Court today in case Number 06-7949, Gall versus United States, which he has asked me to announce.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.183" offset="149442">This case comes to us from the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.002" offset="164697">Petitioner Gall pleaded guilty to participating in a conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.666" offset="191342">He had voluntarily withdrawn from the conspiracy and ceased using drugs some three years prior to his indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.715" offset="223525">After a full sentencing hearing, the District Judge decided to sentence petitioner to probation for a term of 36 months instead of imposing a sentence of imprisonment within the 30 to 37 month range recommended by the Sentencing Guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.117" offset="289144">The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for resentencing because it concluded that petitioner's sentence was not supported by a justification that was proportional to the extent of the difference between the advisory range and the sentence that was imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.332" offset="354033">We granted certiorari and now reversed for reasons stated in a 21-page opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.742" offset="379633">We hold that while the extent of the difference between a particular sentence and the recommended Guidelines range is surely relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.366" offset="414114">Courts of Appeals must review all sentences whether inside or outside the Guidelines range under a deferential abuse of discretion standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.333" offset="454029">We also hold that the sentence imposed by the District Judge in this case was reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.525" offset="478793">Justice Scalia and Justice Souter have filed separate concurring opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.300" offset="497915">Justice Thomas and Justice Alito have filed separate dissenting opinions.</text>
