            <label>Justice Clarence Thomas</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104764">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.140" offset="133290">Respondent was employed by petitioner from 1989 until 2002 when she was terminated as part of a companywide reduction in force.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.344" offset="178116">She sued petitioner under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 alleging desperate retreatment based on age.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.045" offset="228898">In support of her claim, respondent sought to introduce testimony by five other former employees of petitioner who claimed that their supervisors, different supervisors, had discriminated against them also because of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.681" offset="303399">Petitioner moved to exclude the testimony, arguing that it was irrelevant to the central issue in the case, whether petitioner was terminated by her supervisor because of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.233" offset="361600">In a minute order, the District Court granted the motion excluding in relevant part evidence of discrimination against employees not similarly situated to plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.639" offset="415308">The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit treated the minute order as the application of a per se rule that evidence from employees with other supervisors is irrelevant to proving discrimination in an age discrimination case.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.700" offset="479464">In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case with instructions to have the District Court clarify the basis for its ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.590" offset="527112">Reviewing courts should afford broad discretion to a District Court's evidentiary rulings.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.769" offset="551771">Contrary to the Court of Appeals' conclusion, nothing in the brief minute order of the District Court includes analysis suggesting that the District Court improperly applied a per se rule to exclude the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.684" offset="611435">When a District Court's language is ambiguous, the Court of Appeals should not simply presume that the lower court reached an incorrect legal conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.084" offset="657097">The Court of Appeals further erred by proceeding to conduct its own balancing of the evidentiary factors after it concluded that the District Court had applied an incorrect rule of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.593" offset="711118">Instead, it should have remanded the case to the District Court to properly apply the federal rules of evidence in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.681" offset="747481">The opinion of the Court is unanimous.</text>
