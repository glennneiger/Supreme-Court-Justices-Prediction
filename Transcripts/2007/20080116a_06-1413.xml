            <text syncTime="10.722" offset="210279">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The ruling of the Illinois Appellate Court in this case radically expanded the Court's operational function test.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.829" offset="250716">The State tax at issue violates the principles of constitutional limitations on state taxing authority for at least two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.100" offset="283735">First, the factors relied on by the appellate court here for functional... for operational function would mean that ownership and investment would meet that standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.622" offset="325845">But that's what this Court rejected in Allied-Signal.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.508" offset="337443">A State does not have the authority to reach out to tax all investments owned by a company that does business in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.830" offset="370671">The operational function demands more.</text>

            <text syncTime="68.058" offset="439634">This is a division of one company.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.293" offset="456561">And we are talking about a sale of assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.979" offset="467324">Not the sale of stock of a subsidiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.697" offset="482161">So what more is there than this is one company, it sells some of its assets?</text>

            <text syncTime="108.350" offset="600757">--No, but the Exxon case involved divisions, and it went in favor of the state taxing authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.437" offset="625103">But the Court applied a straightforward, unitary business analysis to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.757" offset="646419">And, Your Honor, this dates back to the Adams Express case of 1897.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.145" offset="667944">The Court in that case said it's not ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.763" offset="682468">It's about the use, the unitariness of use, not of ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.834" offset="702739">Mobile followed on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.751" offset="710367">Mobile talked about the fact that it's not the corporate form that matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.605" offset="733773">It pointed out that that could have little to do with the underlying determination of apportionment, which depends upon whether it's a discrete business enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.645" offset="777972">And then following on the heels of that analysis in Mobil, the Court applied it to the Exxon case that involved divisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.149" offset="811931">That was a vertically integrated corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.701" offset="822171">It's very different from the facts of this case, and it reached a different result.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.286" offset="836486">Moreover, the Woolworth case involved subsidiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.023" offset="855503">Three out of the four of them were 100 percent wholly owned.</text>

            <text syncTime="178.693" offset="882148">Supposing we don't have corporations here, but an individual resident of New York owned this whole business and a big bunch of it was activities in Illinois, and he sold the business.</text>
