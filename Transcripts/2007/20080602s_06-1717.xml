            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104779">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.339" offset="130066">After prevailing in a contract dispute against the Government, petitioner Richlin Security Service Company filed an application to recover its fees and other expenses of litigation pursuant to Section 504(a)(1) of the Equal Access to Justice Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.873" offset="200178">The fees and expenses Richlin incurred included sums paid to its attorneys for paralegal services.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.783" offset="227868">The question presented in this case is how awards for paralegal fees should be calculated under the Equal Access to Justice Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.317" offset="262036">The Act provides that an eligible party may recover its fees and other expenses incurred in successful litigation by or against the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.506" offset="298712">The Act defines the term fees and other expenses to include "reasonable attorney or agent fees" and "reasonable cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, test or project".</text>
            <text syncTime="62.432" offset="354405">The statute instructs agencies to look to prevailing market rates to calculate fees for attorneys and agents but it makes no mention of paralegals. From this omission, the Federal Circuit reasoned that the Act does not consider fees for paralegal services as fees at all but rather as other expenses recoverable only at the reasonable cost of the services to the party's attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.177" offset="457432">We disagree with that analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.731" offset="463701">The distinction that the Federal Circuit drew between the treatment of fees and other expenses is not supported by the statutory tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.693" offset="499541">It is also at odds with our decisions interpreting the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act, 42 U.S.C. Section 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.929" offset="536426">Those decisions lead us to conclude that the term “attorney's fees in Equal Access to Justice Act” refers to compensation not only for the attorney's personal labor but also for the labor of paralegals who contribute to the attorney's work product.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.091" offset="597135">Since the Equal Access to Justice Act expressly provides that attorney fees are recoverable at prevailing market rates, it follows that paralegal fees must be as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.243" offset="637677">The Government's arguments from the Equal Access to Justice Act's legislative history and from considerations of public policy and sovereign immunity do not persuade this otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.289" offset="685847">For these reasons discussed at greater length in the opinion filed today with the Clerk of the Court, we hold that a prevailing party that satisfies the Equal Access to Justice Act's other requirements may recover its paralegal fees from the Government at prevailing market rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.170" offset="749377">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is accordingly reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with our opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.432" offset="778425">The judgment of the Court is unanimous.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.628" offset="787202">The opinion of the Court is also unanimous except that Justice Scalia does not concur in Part III-A of the Court's opinion, and Justice Thomas does not concur in Part II-B or Part III of the Court's opinion.</text>
