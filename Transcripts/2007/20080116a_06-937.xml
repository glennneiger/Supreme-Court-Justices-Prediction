            <text syncTime="9.939" offset="209494">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Under this Court's exhaustion cases, exhaustion has always been triggered when two criteria have been satisfied and the district court properly dismissed these claims because it found that they were satisfied here on the undisputed facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.650" offset="280338">The first is that there must be an authorized sale under the patent that was allegedly infringed.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.554" offset="307924">That's never been in dispute in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.154" offset="318372">The Federal Circuit recognized that Intel was authorized to sell these components under the system and method patents at issue in the case that have been allegedly infringed.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.695" offset="360482">And the second criteria is that the article sold must be one that falls within the protection of the patent that was allegedly infringed, here the system and method patents.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.503" offset="407711">But as Univis holds, that test doesn't apply simply to articles that would directly infringe the patent, because the law with contributory infringement standards provides that protection to the patent owner also to articles that would contributorily infringe.</text>

            <text syncTime="129.080" offset="686072">--I don't think that's what the lower courts found and I don't think that's what the argument has ever been, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.634" offset="704253">I think this is just like Bobbs-Merrill.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.567" offset="711986">There is a... this Court has recognized that there is a difference between actually conditioning the seller's authority to sell to someone who's going to use it for some prohibited purpose, and that would be a case like General Talking Pictures, where it says, you do not have authority to sell to someone who's going to use it for the home market.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.814" offset="788995">But Bobbs-Merrill says if what you do instead... it was a copyright case that was applied in Motion Picture Patents.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.534" offset="815848">If what you do instead is you give them authority to sell, you don't say you'll be in breach if you sell it to somebody who's going to sell books at below the retail price I've specified, if instead what you do is say, you have to agree you'll give them notice that the... that the owner of the invention, or in that case the copyright, is not agreeing to your use of these books or sale of these books at below a certain price, that doesn't count.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.285" offset="922846">There's still an authorized sale, that when... that you can't... that the patent owner can't try to retain part of the monopoly right to sell.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="196.522" offset="955865">Well, if that's true then this case really isn't a big deal at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.307" offset="974986">It just depends on exactly how you word the contract when the patentee sells it to a purchaser.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.782" offset="1016887">You can word it... in other words, you can word it in such a way that the patentee's rights extend further downstream and you're saying all this case turns on is whether the wording here was correct or not.</text>

            <label>Ms. Maureen E. Mahoney</label>
            <text syncTime="224.256" offset="1066728">Well, the wording hasn't been in dispute, but a lot of important things turn on it, because of course if Intel didn't have the authority to make these sales, it would be liable for contributory infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.528" offset="1107897">And undoubtedly when Intel decided how much to pay for this license it cared deeply about whether it was going to be exposed to that liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="243.467" offset="1143633">Well, I understand your position to... to acknowledge that they could have structured the sale to Intel in such a way as to achieve the same result that you're saying is so bad under the patent laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="263.231" offset="1222627">I think the Chief has something on this order in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.767" offset="1240808">Could the patentee say to the licensee, to the Intel, that, I license you to sell only to buyers who have a license from the patentee?</text>
            <text syncTime="289.465" offset="1327639">Could... could the licensee be limited in that way?</text>

            <label>Ms. Maureen E. Mahoney</label>
            <text syncTime="294.436" offset="1347492">--They could do that, and let me explain the consequences of doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.971" offset="1361599">If Intel then under those circumstances sold to a buyer who did not have a license, Intel would be liable for contributory infringement because it wouldn't be an authorized sale, and the buyer would be liable for infringement because it didn't acquire the goods through an authorized sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.849" offset="1433174">If the buyer instead has the license, has obtained the license from the patentowner, then there has been an authorized sale and any remedies that the owner of the patent would have against the buyer would be those found in contract, because the triggering line under this Court's cases is has there been an authorized sale?</text>
            <text syncTime="336.846" offset="1517079">And this makes perfect sense because--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="338.529" offset="1523871">But explain to me... perhaps I should ask Mr. Phillips this question... but why isn't it done that way?</text>
            <text syncTime="347.385" offset="1559293">The way... if the patentee wants to maintain control further down the line, why doesn't the patentee just limit the licensee to selling to people who are licensed?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="maureen_e_mahoney" startTime="364.077" stopTime="397.115">
            <label>Ms. Maureen E. Mahoney</label>
            <text syncTime="364.077" offset="1626062">--Presumably because in this circumstance... it's not in the record... but presumably Intel wouldn't agree to these terms unless it in fact was given authority to sell, no matter how it was going to be used, because otherwise it would still be on the hook for liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.237" offset="1686666">And... and presumably they could have done something that would have required an agreement with... you know, between... only sell to someone with an agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.045" offset="1733896">But for whatever reason the parties didn't negotiate that term.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.865" offset="1749151">Perhaps Intel wasn't willing to do it that way.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="397.115" offset="1758242">So the parties are unwilling to spell out exactly how this is going to work out in their contract, and each side, it prefers to take their chances on how the Federal Circuit's going to rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.804" offset="1796903">It's easier to sell these things if they're not encumbered by these additional license requirements and the manufacturer presumably gets a lot more, but there's a lot of uncertainty, uncertainty that could have been cured by how the contract was drafted, and people prefer to live with that uncertainty and litigate rather than clear it up in the contract.</text>

            <label>Ms. Maureen E. Mahoney</label>
            <text syncTime="426.718" offset="1876629">Well, I think that this Court's ruling would certainly make things clear, but I think that the language of the contract recognizes that the... specifically says that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the ordinary operation of patent exhaustion is supposed to apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.560" offset="1935979">In other words, I think Intel knew--</text>

            <text syncTime="442.877" offset="1941204">Fine, and the person who wrote that provision knows that the question of how the patent-exhaustion doctrine applies is the subject of great confusion, so much confusion that the Supreme Court's going to have to decide it, and yet they put that in there rather than spelling out in the contract exactly which they had in mind, whether or not you could impose these further restrictions or couldn't.</text>

            <text syncTime="462.058" offset="2018004">--But, Your Honor, I think that under this Court's decision in Univis Lens, as the district court recognized, the answer in this case is actually quite clear what the patent-exhaustion doctrine would require.</text>

            <text syncTime="477.167" offset="2078399">--It wasn't clear to the Federal Circuit, but it was clear to the district court, showing that the idea that somehow it was absolutely known to everybody what the outcome of this issue would be is not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.173" offset="2118418">The district court, I think correctly, understood that Univis Lens was the controlling case.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.660" offset="2136390">Of course, the Federal Circuit didn't even cite it.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.743" offset="2144750">But the district court found that the Univis Lens standard was satisfied because these components were necessarily manufactured in a manner that satisfied, that included the functionality of the system and method patents at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.722" offset="2216639">At 30a, the district court looks to LGE's own claim charts and says that their own allegations show that they were manufactured in a way that met many of the limitations of the claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.346" offset="2263137">In addition, at 67 of the petition appendix, she says that by attaching the components, the Intel chips, to the... the other generic wires and memory, it necessarily caused these products to infringe.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.474" offset="2343594">And, at 46, she says,</text>
            <text syncTime="545.676" offset="2352475">"Failure to follow Intel's design specifications would render the computers inoperable. "</text>
            <text syncTime="551.330" offset="2375045">So, this is a case where there's just no question that if LGE's allegations are correct these products would have contributorily infringed.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.786" offset="2412870">So Intel knew that in order to avoid potential liability to... to LGE, that it had to get full authority to sell, and it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.910" offset="2461354">And there's never been any dispute about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.462" offset="2471594">Instead, there's simply the Federal Circuit's view that even if you have an authorized sale, that the patentowner is nevertheless allowed to say, okay, I authorize the seller to sell it to anybody, but I want to retain the right to control the use of the... of the buyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.991" offset="2541706">And that's exactly what this Court's cases have always said, with the exception of A.B. Dick, cannot be done because the whole point of the exhaustion doctrine is to demarcate the line between where the monopoly power to control rights to use and sell end and where any rights under contract must begin.</text>

            <text syncTime="1017.440" offset="4239457">The court below erroneously transformed that patent-exhaustion doctrine from a definitional principle that delimits the scope of the patent grant into an optional default assumption that can be discarded at the whim of the patentee.</text>

            <text syncTime="3365.411" offset="13631417">I'd like to start by emphasizing what counsel did not say.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.696" offset="13652524">He never said that Intel lacked the authority under the system and method patents to sell these components.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.433" offset="13687424">He never said that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.702" offset="13692544">In fact, he said that Intel was released.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.504" offset="13703724">Why were they released?</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.454" offset="13707590">This would have been contributory infringement, otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.888" offset="13717308">The reason they were released was because they had the authority under this license to sell these components under the system patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.811" offset="13752939">And that's what the Federal Circuit acknowledged, and that's what the district court recognized, and it's never been in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.898" offset="13773315">Their position is simply that, despite that, despite express authority to sell these under that patent... not just under some other patent, under the patents at issue here... that they can enforce conditions on post-sale use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.891" offset="13833292">And that's what this Court has never allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.343" offset="13843114">Univis is on all fours.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.609" offset="13852204">They say, well, that just involved a single patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.645" offset="13864325">Well, as far as this case is concerned, it just involves a single patent, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.449" offset="13879581">The whole issue here is whether or not Quanta's taking of the components and combining them with some generic things like wires and memory necessarily infringed under LGE's allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.708" offset="13940603">And the district court found that they would, and that's not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.243" offset="13954709">And what that means is that, just as in Univis where you had... the court finds there were really two products there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.480" offset="13979682">It finds there were two different commodities, the lens blank and the finished lens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.301" offset="14002983">It says under Miller, the Miller/Tydings Act, these are two different commodities, and the patent was only on the finished lens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.205" offset="14034539">But, in order to make that finished lens, you had to... you had to make a lens blank that would embody many of the limitations of the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.561" offset="14071946">That's exactly what the district court found happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.798" offset="14084903">For this, when Intel manufactured these chips, the microprocessors and the chipsets, it manufactured them in a way that embodied many of the limitations of the system and method patents that are at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.592" offset="14156061">So, as in the language of Univis, there they said, well, we are dealing with a product that is being manufactured in multiple stages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.448" offset="14195558">And during that first stage, while it's true it wasn't... it didn't directly infringe because the lens blank wasn't the patented product, they, nevertheless, practiced the patent in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.506" offset="14247803">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.124" offset="14250206">Because they... they... some of the... while manufacturing it, they have met some of the limitations of the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.111" offset="14274134">And they said when that lens blank was sold, that it exhausted the rights of the patent owner to enforce any conditions, any type of conditions on use or resale after that sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.253" offset="14326797">And it didn't have to rely on implied license because of the exhaustion doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.407" offset="14347381">Once there is an authorized sale of a product that is protected by the patent that covered that final finished product, exhaustion is triggered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.846" offset="14385102">That's exactly what we have here.</text>
