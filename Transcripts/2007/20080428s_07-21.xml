            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104608">These three cases come to us from the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.976" offset="132507">The cases concerned Indiana's Voter Identification Law passed in 2005 that requires Indiana voters to present government-issued photo identification before voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.024" offset="188618">Promptly, after the law's enactment, petitioners filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, seeking to enjoin election officials from enforcing the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.680" offset="239295">Petitioners argued that the Voter ID law unconstitutionally burdens Indiana citizens' right to hold under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.619" offset="279001">Specifically, they claimed that Indiana's interest in enacting such a law to combat in-person fraudulent voting, did not justify the burdens of Voter ID law imposed on voters who did not already have acceptable photo identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.463" offset="354443">The District Court rejected petitioners' arguments and granted summary judgment for the election officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.527" offset="378685">The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed both the opinion of the District Court and the Seventh Circuit's opinion noted the absence of any plaintiffs who claimed that the law would deter them from voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.308" offset="437826">We granted certiorari because of the importance of these cases to voting laws throughout the country and we now affirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.051" offset="468755">In the opinion that I have authored through which is joined by the Chief Justice and Justice Kennedy, we hold that the petitioners' evidence is not sufficient to support a facial attack on the validity of Indiana's Voter ID Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.327" offset="529881">Indiana's interest in preventing voter fraud in safeguarding public confidence in elections are legitimate and weighty and petitioners have failed to prove an excessive burden on any class of voters because petitioners advanced a broad attack on the constitutionality of the Voter ID law and seek to invalidate in its entirety, they bearing a specially heavy burden of persuasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.187" offset="641268">For further -- for reasons further elaborated in our opinion, they have not met that burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.570" offset="666868">Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, which Justice Thomas and Justice Alito has joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.407" offset="698215">Justice Souter has filed a dissenting opinion, which Justice Ginsburg has joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.581" offset="718904">And Justice Breyer has also filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
