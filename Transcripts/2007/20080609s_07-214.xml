            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104632">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4.336" offset="121873">The Navy contracted with two shipyards to build destroyers that needed generator sets for electrical power.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.918" offset="148204">The shipyards, in turn, contracted with petitioner, Allison Engine to build the generator sets.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.355" offset="177984">Allison Engine subcontracted with petitioner General Tool Company to assemble the generator sets and General Tool subcontracted with petitioner Southern Ohio Fabricators to manufacture the generator sets.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.485" offset="238483">The subcontracts required that each generator set be accompanied by a certificate of conformance, certifying that the unit was manufactured according to Navy specifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.823" offset="287907">Former General Tool Company employees filed the qui tam action that is now before us asserting claims under two provisions of the False Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.618" offset="327091">31 U.S.C. Section 3729(a)(2), which imposes to the liability on any person who knowingly uses a false statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or proved by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.367" offset="386023">And 31 U.S.C. Section 3729(a)(3), which reaches conspiracies to defraud the Government by getting a false or fraudulent claim allowed or paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.519" offset="434611">At trial, respondents failed to introduce evidence that petitioners had submitted a false claim to the Navy.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.203" offset="461360">The District Court granted petitioners judgment as a matter of law concluding that without such proof, respondent's evidence was legally insufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.548" offset="498768">The Sixth Circuit reversed in relevant part holding that respondentâ€™s claims did not require proof of an intent to cause a false claim to be paid by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.566" offset="534816">Rather, that Court held that it was enough to show that petitioners intended to cause such a claim to be paid by private entity using government funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.839" offset="571910">We disagree with that analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.445" offset="578389">We hold that it is insufficient for a plaintiff asserting a Section 3729(a)(2) claim, to show merely that the false statements used resulted in the payment or approval of the claim or that government money was used to pay the false or fraudulent claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.968" offset="648501">Instead, such a plaintiff must prove that the defendant intended that the false statement be material to the Government's decision to pay or approve the false claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.196" offset="689357">This does not mean that Section 3729(a)(2) requires proof that a defendant's false statement was in fact submitted to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.138" offset="721122">Instead, a subcontractor violates section 3729(a)(2), if it submits a false statement to the prime contractor, intending that contractor to use the statement to get the Government to pay its claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.511" offset="774621">Similarly, it is not enough under Section 3729(a)(3) for a plaintiff to show that the alleged conspirators agreed upon a fraud scheme that had the effect of causing a private entity to make payments, using money obtained from the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.237" offset="837523">Instead, it must be shown that they intended to defraud the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.470" offset="854451">Because the decision of the Court of Appeals was based on an incorrect interpretation of Sections 3729(a)(2) and (3), we vacate the judgment and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.710" offset="907427">The judgment of the Court is unanimous.</text>
