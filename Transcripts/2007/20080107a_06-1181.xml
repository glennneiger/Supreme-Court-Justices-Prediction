            <label>Mr. Christopher J. Meade</label>
            <text syncTime="7.388" offset="198244">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress has provided that certain aliens, including those with good moral character, are eligible for voluntary departure.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.977" offset="248608">Congress has also provided that all aliens may file one motion to reopen raising new facts within 90 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.113" offset="281209">The question is how to reconcile these two provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.925" offset="300435">The parties agree on two key points: First, the Government agrees that the statute can be read to preserve motions to reopen for voluntary departure recipients.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.481" offset="354665">Second, the Government agrees that such aliens can file a motion to reopen; and if the immigration official happens to act quickly enough, the alien will receive a ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.711" offset="411612">But, under the Government's view, if the official does not act quickly enough, the alien is denied an adjudication.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="69.706" offset="447557">Can we consider that in your case, given that the application to reopen was made when there were only two days left to run for the termination of the voluntary departure time... in other words, it was your delay, not the Government's, that made it impossible to decide this in the requisite time?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Christopher J. Meade</label>
            <text syncTime="96.524" offset="554868">Yes, Justice Ginsburg, and I have two responses, one relating to this particular case as well as the cases in general.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.928" offset="580468">But, as to this particular case, Mr. Dada found new counsel, which took a week; and in the remaining time he prepared a motion to reopen with 80 pages of exhibits including affidavits, five letters, medical documents, financial records including tax returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.810" offset="647968">And that's why it took an additional two-and-a-half weeks to do the motion to reopen.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.637" offset="667299">But, as a general matter, aliens file at different periods during the period.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.776" offset="687779">For example, in the Eleventh Circuit case of Ugokwe the alien filed with 30 days left in the period, and the Government, the agency, didn't act in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.460" offset="730515">But what happens in the agency is that motions to reopen are, in fact, decided relatively quickly... just not quickly enough.</text>

            <text syncTime="166.323" offset="834065">However, there are numerous cases presenting very sympathetic facts which show grants of motions to reopen.</text>

            <text syncTime="178.006" offset="880771">As a general matter, there are 10,000 motions to reopen filed, but that's for all aliens, for all removal proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.394" offset="906267">Since voluntary departure is roughly 10 percent of all removals, we estimate that'S roughly a thousand motions to reopen filed by voluntary departure recipients.</text>

            <text syncTime="195.109" offset="949212">So there would be no reason not to file one of these if you were subject to voluntary... if you elected voluntary departure, and it extended your time to stay, right?</text>
            <text syncTime="203.636" offset="983276">Seemingly, everybody would file one of these if we rule in your favor.</text>

            <text syncTime="1634.285" offset="6705869">But Congress passed a statute that grants a statutory right to file a motion to reopen no matter what the relief is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.718" offset="6743589">And the thing that seems strange to me, I guess to carry Justice Scalia's question one step further, is what seems strange to me is that Congress would have granted that right in effect across the board, regardless of what the reason for the reopening might be and yet would have done so knowing that the, that the time for adjudication before the IJ is likely to take longer than the period of the, prior to the moment of required departure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.329" offset="6890084">It sounds as though Congress on your view would be... would have been giving a right to reopen that in practical terms in most cases will avail the alien absolutely nothing because he'll have to get out before there can be an adjudication.</text>

Congress wasn't concerned about preserving the underlying substantive eligibility for those forms of discretionary relief, because it made that part of the deal, that alien was giving up if he left... if he didn't leave the country, he was giving up that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3136.262" offset="12713823">I would like to come back to the fundamental automatic tolling rule that... the fundamental inconsistency of that automatic tolling rule with what Congress did in 1996, because it shortened to 60 days the time limit in which an alien can depart.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.912" offset="12772337">It also eliminated a prior exception that had been the law that allowed an exception to the consequences for somebody who overstayed even the much longer voluntary departure period for exceptional circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.690" offset="12823537">Congress repealed that exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.768" offset="12827821">Prior to 1996, the Board in the case we cite in our briefs called Matter of Shaar, held that if an alien is granted voluntary departure and files a motion to reopen, it rejected two arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.229" offset="12877663">One is that the filing of a motion to reopen was itself exceptional circumstances that eliminated the deadline.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.649" offset="12899292">It rejected that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.539" offset="12902845">It also in an en banc decision rejected the automatic tolling rule that Petitioner is arguing for here under a situation in which Congress had granted a long time for aliens to voluntarily depart.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.598" offset="12951119">We think it defies common sense to suggest that when Congress compressed the time to 60 days, it meant to at the same time reverse what the Board had done in Matter of Shaar and granted an automatic tolling rule, not even one under the control of the immigration authorities, but an automatic tolling rule as a matter of law simply by the unilateral act of filing a motion to reopen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.275" offset="13041816">And the Board in Matter of Shaar addressed all of those things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.884" offset="13060311">The Board of Immigration Appeals has filed, followed Matter of Shaar, in the intervening years since 1997... and importantly, I would like to point this out, too, when Petitioner sought a motion for reopening, he relied on a Board decision called Villarde, which recognized that in some circumstances an alien may file a motion to reopen to try to get adjustment of status if there has been intervening development with respect to an immediate relative petition filed by a spouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.842" offset="13168145">The Board adopted that rule in this en banc published decision Villarde, but said one of the qualifications for being eligible for that relief is that you not be barred under Matter of Shaar, which means you not be barred by having overstayed your voluntary departure period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.130" offset="13241287">So, in the very procedure that Petitioner invoked in this case, there is a published Board decision post-1997 that relies on that... that relies on that rationale, and the Board has followed that consistently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.063" offset="13288935">It is at the very least a reasonable interpretation of the act for the Attorney General not to allow the undermining of this tightened voluntary departure system by providing for reopening.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.482" offset="13334701">I should also point out that this is not tolling in the normal sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.325" offset="13345986">Tolling usually arises where a person has a claim and there is a statute of limitations for filing a claim before a forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.961" offset="13372527">Petitioner here was already granted voluntary departure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.163" offset="13385379">The 60-day time limit is not a procedural statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.505" offset="13398754">It is a limitation on substantive immigration relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.691" offset="13411501">And we think it's particularly odd that the filing of a procedural motion to reopen would have the effect of changing the statutorily limited time in which an alien could voluntarily depart the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="3353.814" offset="13584014">Second, the proposed rule makes clear that Congress did not intend voluntary departure recipients to waive the motion to reopen in accepting voluntary departure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.061" offset="13628945">Third, the rule stresses the importance of motions to reopen and their importance in bringing changed facts to the agency's attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.854" offset="13668128">Fourth, the proposed rule turns on unilateral action of the alien and permits that unilateral action to terminate the voluntary departure grant.</text>
