            <text syncTime="281.823" offset="1292276">The reason for that, Justice Breyer, is as follows: The person who's 49 and gets disabled, assuming he does not have... he or she doesn't have 20 years of service, can't retire.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.429" offset="1342744">The person who is 55 in your example can leave tomorrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.521" offset="1355074">Additionally, the person who begins work older starts out closer to retirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.111" offset="1385481">We are not talking about two different groups of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.703" offset="1399796">The plan favors the older worker by saying on the day you begin work, you're always closer to retiring than a younger person.</text>

            <text syncTime="395.919" offset="1748687">The person who starts older takes advantage of the fact that in this retirement plan you can retire with as little as five years of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.275" offset="1782124">Actually a person who is 55 is eligible for a benefit after only a month.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.945" offset="1800723">In fact, Kentucky may be the only plan in the country that does that.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.381" offset="1814516">But where they don't start out alike and where the EEOC's chart is based on fallacy is that the person who began older in work in your example was always closer to retirement, they needed less years.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.421" offset="1874702">The purpose of the plan for disability purposes, which is not a separate plan, it's simply a means of getting one to normal retirement who is not otherwise eligible.</text>

            <text syncTime="1399.287" offset="5762140">The statute was challenged as being facially discriminatory, and I think under this Court's precedents for facial discrimination, one would have to say that the only reasonable inference in the statute, by its mere use of age, is that you say that it starts out presumptively discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.575" offset="5843329">What the Government has really argued here is an as-applied circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.949" offset="5860779">They said the effect of the statute in certain cases, and in those circumstances the statute would stand on its face and if there is a circumstance in which someone effectively is discriminated, then you look to see are there reasonable factors other than age that effect... that take effect in this instance?</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.301" offset="5930160">Secondly, I think the Court can determine... and I think this is the question that is the next step after Hazen, where you said that age correlated with pension status, in that case being vested for 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.859" offset="5988465">The question is, if a plan has eligibility to retire as its motivation, that is, it is service regardless of age or age plus service, is it really motivated by age?</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.853" offset="6036426">And I think the answer to that question, Justice Kennedy, clearly is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.320" offset="6054294">The one thing I would add is if you look at the statute in Betts, the Ohio case, which is the last time an age case on a public plan got to this Court, in the Ohio plan you couldn't get a disability because you were 60, but you could also retire in that plan just like Kentucky on years of service alone, but a years-of-service retiree in Ohio could get a disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.592" offset="6151365">That's not true in Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.560" offset="6159202">Somebody who starts as a firefighter at 18 no longer has disability protection at 38 years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.555" offset="6191176">A person who starts as a police officer at 45 retains disability coverage until they're 55.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.053" offset="6221164">I think... I think the language of the statute alone enables you to get there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.348" offset="6242376">And I think to get back to Justice Ginsburg's question... and I don't believe I fully answered on this issue of the role of the word "arbitrary" in the statute... I think that that gives that word meaning, not just because it's in the preamble, but because it's in the legislative history, and the evil that Congress was trying to get to is what is it that we're trying to prevent?</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.825" offset="6332237">We're trying to create job opportunities for older workers, and what Congress said after Betts is you want to make sure benefit plans are covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.679" offset="6363688">And I think Kentucky has accomplished both.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.912" offset="6376645">It doesn't use a retirement age, as many employers do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.426" offset="6394722">Again, the Federal Government forces police officers and firefighters out of their jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.956" offset="6412798">Firefighters at 55, police officers at 57.</text>

            <text syncTime="2593.360" offset="10538473">And certainly the employer could say justifiably as a group people above that age are likely to have fewer work years ahead of them than people below that age.</text>

            <text syncTime="2736.521" offset="11111078">Congress did that by enacting a new 29 U.S.C. 630(l) to say the term... that the phrase "terms and conditions of employment" includes fringe benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.094" offset="11157367">And the legislative history explains that Congress could have achieved the same result by adding a reference to fringe benefits in the basic anti-discrimination provision contained in 29 U.S.C. 623(a), but the Congress chose not to do that because it wanted to maintain the similarity in wording between the ADEA's anti-discrimination provision and that of Title VII in order to reinforce the inference that the two were to be construed in pari materia.</text>

            <text syncTime="3009.739" offset="12203936">For example, if you have two workers, one who starts work at 18 and acquires years of service, say, 12 years of service and becomes disabled, you would say, well, you can take those years of service into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.282" offset="12246150">The older worker who begins at age 30 and is disabled in his first year on the job, you say, well, you can only look at years of service.</text>

            <text syncTime="3108.826" offset="12600266">If Kentucky wants to say a younger person who is forced to retire due to disability will be treated as though he were 55 years old, that's fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.741" offset="12639972">If they give him disability benefits and they calculate the benefits using actual years of service as they do for the other... for the older employees, that there is no ADEA problem with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.816" offset="12676230">Our problem is that they say we are treating him as though he had worked additional years until he was 55 when he hasn't, and when the older employee isn't given that same opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.984" offset="12724922">And, again, it is true that Kentucky's system is particularly generous to older employees who want to retire voluntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.777" offset="12756060">They can retire with as little as five years of service, even though the younger worker would have to have more.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.917" offset="12776645">But the people on whose behalf the EEOC is suing have not derived any of that benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.631" offset="12803499">These were people who did not retire voluntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.818" offset="12812276">They were people who were eligible for retirement benefits, but chose to remain in the work force.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.160" offset="12837667">And, essentially, they are being told, in estimating how many more years you would have worked, we are going to have an irrebuttable presumption that the answer is zero, even though their very circumstances, the fact that they continued to work after they could have retired, belie that assumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.498" offset="12899002">And just a final point I wanted to make about Betts, is that the system here is not identical, but very similar to the system that was at issue there, in the sense that an older worker who was forced to retire due to disability got a lower benefit than she would have received if she had been younger with the same years of service and the same disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.598" offset="12979355">It couldn't be clearer that Congress wanted to overturn that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.675" offset="12995656">That was the impetus for the enactment of the OWBPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.518" offset="13011016">So I think there is really... it's not correct to suggest that, even if we win, this is somehow an unintended consequence of what Congress did.</text>

            <text syncTime="3274.789" offset="13264194">But I take your point that those aspects of the statute introduce a further element of age discrimination without even the justification that Kentucky has proffered for the imputed years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.596" offset="13311424">With respect to the children, in particular, that seems to be the only other area in the plan in which Kentucky is directly targeting the people who are in greatest financial need, at least by one measure having dependent children, and yet the older workers are left out of that entirely.</text>

            <text syncTime="3320.520" offset="13447051">If a person is 38 years old and has 20 years of service, that benefit is not available.</text>

            <text syncTime="3331.188" offset="13489788">The benefit is not available to the 38-year-old because that person is eligible to retire on a normal retirement benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.935" offset="13520717">Age isn't the driver.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.341" offset="13526359">Eligibility for retirement is the motivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.996" offset="13540988">And while my brother says that Congress wanted to overturn Betts, what they wanted to overturn in Betts was the language in this Court's decision that cast doubt on whether pension plans were generally covered by the language of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.896" offset="13604622">And the Older Workers Benefits Protection Act, if one looks at the legislative history, was focused far less on what happened in a public employee retirement system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.549" offset="13643179">The real issue that Congress focused on, if one looks at the House and Senate reports, is they said there is a problem in private industry in the Rust Belt that normal retirement eligibility is being used to force people not to get some other benefit in some other stand-alone plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.090" offset="13705350">That's not the issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.808" offset="13712247">And the plan in Betts is no more like Kentucky's plan than the Thurston plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.180" offset="13737742">In Thurston, the pilot case, no pilot over 60, no matter how skillful, had bumping rights to be a flight engineer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.443" offset="13770761">In Kentucky, one with 20 years of service, regardless of age, is in the same posture as someone who is 55 with a minimum service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.391" offset="13810571">My brother also pointed you to a provision in the Kentucky statute on pages 7a and... page 7a in the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.684" offset="13847770">Look also at 2a, which defines normal retirement to be 55 with 5 years of service, or 20 years of service regardless of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.212" offset="13885804">The methodology for determining disability in this case is exactly the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.943" offset="13908792">It's based on your proximity to normal retirement, not based on your age.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.130" offset="13929481">One example was given.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.863" offset="13936482">If a person is 45 years old with 4 years of service and became disabled, that person would get nothing because they haven't met the five-year service requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.391" offset="13974516">But a 55-year-old with 4 years of service has a normal retirement benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.013" offset="14008998">It's about limited Government resources not being duplicated, and perhaps that's the reason why the EEOC adopted its regulation on December 26th coordinating retiree health care.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.040" offset="14053197">The rationale they gave was we looked at all the... all the ways to do this, and we couldn't come up with a reason to do it any other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.332" offset="14094366">In the Sixth Circuit Federal argument, Judge Boggs noted in his dissent... Chief Judge Boggs noted he asked the EEOC for a reason on how to fix this, and they couldn't give him one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.704" offset="14135848">What this case is about is about being fair to workers without regard to age.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.982" offset="14164896">All the people who run these plans, who fund these plans, who are in these plans, are all lined up on Kentucky's side of the table.</text>

            <text syncTime="3512.710" offset="14215783">The plan is fair, and the plan does not violate the law.</text>
