            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104843">Justice Thomas has our opinion this morning in case 07-312, Florida Department of Revenue versus Piccadilly Cafeterias.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="clarence_thomas" startTime="9.806" stopTime="214.622">
            <label>Justice Clarence Thomas</label>
            <text syncTime="9.806" offset="144027">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.696" offset="171612">Respondent, Piccadilly Cafeterias declared bankruptcy under Chapter 11, but before Piccadilly submitted its Chapter 11 plan to the bankruptcy court, Piccadilly sought and received court authorization to sell substantially all of its assets, and was granted an exemption from state stamp tax pursuant to 11 U.S.C. Section 1146(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="47.008" offset="292820">That Section provides a stamp tax exemption for any asset transfer, "Under a plan confirmed under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.”</text>
            <text syncTime="58.044" offset="337019">Piccadilly submitted and received court approval of its Chapter 11 plan but only after the sale of its assets had been taken place.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.115" offset="385294">Petitioner, Florida Department of Revenue objected, arguing that the stamp taxes, it had assessed on certain of Piccadilly's transferred assets fell outside the Section 1146(a) exemption because at the time of the sale, the transfers at issued were not under a plan confirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.665" offset="475468">The District Court upheld the bankruptcy courts grant of the exemption and the Eleventh Circuit affirmed, holding that the Section 1146(a) exemption applies to pre-confirmation transfers necessary to the consummation of a plan that is eventually confirmed under Chapter 11, provided there is some nexus between such transfers and the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.456" offset="590616">In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.340" offset="614126">The most natural reading of Section 1146(a)'s text, the provisions placement within the Bankruptcy Code and applicable substantive cannons all lead to the same conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.176" offset="669506">Section 1146(a) affords a stamp tax exemption only to transfers made pursuant to a Chapter 11 plan that has already been confirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.220" offset="721646">First to phrase, under a plan confirmed is most naturally read to mean that the plan must be confirmed at the time assets are sold and transferred under it.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.226" offset="769712">Second, the natural reading is consistent with the provision’s placement in a subchapter entitled, “Post-confirmation matters.”</text>
            <text syncTime="177.250" offset="813806">Finally, construing Section 1146(a) narrowly to apply only to post-confirmation transfers is compelled by the long standing cannon that courts should narrowly interpret an exemption from state taxation, that Congress has not clearly expressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.794" offset="883919">In sum, because Section 1146(a) does not apply to pre-confirmation transfers, Piccadilly may not avoid Florida's stamp taxes by invoking back that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.567" offset="939090">Justice Breyer has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Stevens has joined.</text>
