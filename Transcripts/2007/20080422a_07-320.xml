            <text syncTime="3221.425" offset="13055255">Because as... your point in this case, rather than the hypothetical, is that the self-financed candidate is not burdened in any way, but simply that his opponent has benefited.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.328" offset="13090781">And it seems to me that would be true in the case of my hypothetical as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="3233.874" offset="13104992">Again, if I'm understanding the hypo right, I think you would say there that the candidate is effectively burdened because if you get to the point where you're past what I would call $2 additional additionally, I think at that point a rational candidate is not going to engage in self-finance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.836" offset="13180851">And so in practice, the provision would operate as an absolute cap, rather than the way it operates here, which is not as a cap.</text>

            <text syncTime="3350.546" offset="13571748">I mean, you're right that to the extent that this says this really sounds as an equal protection case more than a First Amendment case, at the remedial stage you'd ask the question: Should we level up and have both candidates have a larger cap or should we level down and hold them both to the $2300 level?</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.306" offset="13638726">I would say two things, if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.711" offset="13644368">One is it's no accident that Appellant isn't asking you to level up because what... they're not interested in doing additional financing; they're really taking... interested in taking advantage of keeping the opponent down to the $2300 level.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.143" offset="13698076">The only other thing that I would say about this choice between leveling up and leveling down is I would say that the statute that would have relaxed the caps for both candidates would pose the same First Amendment issue as this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.200" offset="13754291">And so it really is, at bottom, an equal protection claim that you have before you.</text>
