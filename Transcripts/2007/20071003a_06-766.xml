            <text syncTime="9.106" offset="203124">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For 10 years, New York relied on political party primaries to nominate general election candidates for supreme court justice, but that process discouraged qualified candidates and spawned unseemly, expensive, and potentially corrupting fundraising by judicial candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.137" offset="299255">So the legislature substituted an indirect party primary system at which delegates are elected who, in turn, select general election candidates at political party conventions.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.295" offset="351918">The Second Circuit concluded that the delegate convention statutes enabled political parties to exercise too much influence at the expense of the insurgent party members or insurgent candidates and struck those statutes down as facially unconstitutional and reinstated the discredited primary process.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.977" offset="442615">The issue in this case is whether the delegate-convention system is facially unconstitutional because it allows party leaders to defeat the aspirations of party insurgents.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.368" offset="496218">States have broad, as this case has repeatedly held... broad constitutional latitude to prescribe the time, place, and manner of elections, particularly elections for State office.</text>

            <text syncTime="672.916" offset="2858419">Let me say... let me enumerate the ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.303" offset="2871898">An individual, a rank-and-file member, can campaign and vote for delegates.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.672" offset="2889348">An individual might become a delegate himself by... or herself, by getting 500 names on a signature, and that's far below what this Court has indicated before was... was an acceptable level of requirement of access to the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.717" offset="2953609">An individual can attempt to form delegate slates, can attempt to persuade the delegates, can... the individual can form or switch parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.755" offset="2989763">In this case the Respondent Lopez Torres, actually in the 2003 election, became a candidate at the general election for supreme court justice of the Working Families Party, and she did that without giving up her registration and membership in the Democratic Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.782" offset="3057890">She was in that election and she lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.634" offset="3069280">Finally, and this is even if she hadn't been able to secure the nomination of that political party, she could run in the general election.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.490" offset="3104702">There's access to... it takes 3500 to 4,000 signatures to run as an independent body in the general election.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.678" offset="3137407">So there is way after way after way for individuals in New York to participate in the election process.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.482" offset="3164679">So in answer to your question, Justice Kennedy, to the extent that your statement of the principle with respect to access to both the primary and the general election is... is the law of this Court, then that access exists here.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.028" offset="3226850">But I come back to the point that political parties have the greatest possible latitude... yes, Justice Scalia, that the Court has upheld certain restrictions with respect to how the nominee of the party gets selected.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.919" offset="3282334">But the Court has also said that when the party is in that process, its powers and rights and First Amendment freedoms to elect the standard-bearer, to select the standard-bearer, are at their apogee, because the person selected as a candidate, whether that person might be the most favorable person to the rank and file, the duly elected leadership of the political party might decide, well, that person really isn't qualified to be a supreme court justice even--</text>

            <text syncTime="974.579" offset="4065067">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to begin by responding to Justice Kennedy's question regarding the election of delegates and fairness for voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.435" offset="4100489">There are two responses: In this case that I have... this case, there was conceded below that the requirement for delegates of getting only 500 signatures was no barrier at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.659" offset="4153361">And secondly, I would say that in considering that question, Justice Kennedy, the important thing is to consider what is the intended role that the State gives to the participants in this process?</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.633" offset="4205293">And what the role here is that individual voters have the opportunity to vote for local delegates who are to represent their interests at the convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.958" offset="4246566">As Cousins instructs, once they have the opportunity to pull a lever for the delegate that shares their values and their preferences, their right of suffrage is satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.749" offset="4289720">What they do not have, what Respondents and what the lower courts would like to have exist but doesn't exist and isn't required under the Constitution, is the opportunity for rank-and-file voters to vote directly for the candidates at the nomination stage, and that's the difference between a delegate-based convention and a primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.043" offset="4370909">If we agree, and I think the Court would agree, that there is no right to a primary... that's something, in fact, that's conceded in this case; there is no constitutional right to a primary... then there is no State requirement that there be a direct opportunity for association between voter and candidate at the nomination phase; that it is perfectly appropriate and constitutional for that association to be between voter and delegate, and the voters then rely on their locally... elected delegates to advance their interest in the convention process.</text>

            <text syncTime="1116.772" offset="4633805">It's not the frequency of the contest, because there's also evidence in the record that for open primaries for civil court, which is the closest parallel, that those are only contested 28 percent of the time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1233.230" offset="5099621">Let me respond to the most difficult part of your question first, which is the constitutionality of the party leader selecting a candidate we think is not troublesome at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.103" offset="5139118">In fact, there are many instances in New York and in other States where the political leaders, through their structure, do pick the candidates, for example in the case of vacancy election, which this Court upheld as constitutional in the Rodriquez case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.678" offset="5197423">But the question that I think that you're asking is, is there some denial of voter or delegate education, and does that pose a constitutional problem?</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.736" offset="5237652">We have here a bare statutory framework and the statutory framework does not in any way, shape, or form preclude the ability of delegates to become educated about the candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.442" offset="5284463">Within that bare statutory framework.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.294" offset="5295853">The parties themselves, through what we contend is core associational activity protected by the First Amendment, participate in their own way of choosing in educating delegates and in putting forth the candidacies of judicial... potential judicial nominees.</text>

            <text syncTime="1298.338" offset="5360114">I suppose that the State can make the judgment that it's more likely that the delegates would be informed about the qualifications of candidates for judgeship than voters?</text>

            <text syncTime="1307.111" offset="5395118">In fact, we think that is the very judgment that the State has made here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.496" offset="5412672">And when, as Mr. Olson said, when it went from a primary to a convention process, the idea behind it in part was that the delegates could be more educated, would be expected to be more educated than rank-and-file voters would be about judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.739" offset="5469619">And the evidence in this case is that rank-and-file voters are not educated hardly at all about the judge candidates that they select.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.809" offset="5493965">So we think this is clearly a legislative sensible policy choice to put the selection process in the hands of those who have the motivation and the opportunity to become more educated about those that they're selecting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.902" offset="5550285">Now, one thing that needs to be recalled in this process is, of course, it is not merely a State-run election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.608" offset="5585185">As... as the Court observed in Jones, it is a party affair, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.627" offset="5601172">So there are core First Amendment rights of the parties themselves that attach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.495" offset="5620711">And the question... I think in response to Justice Ginsburg's question about whether there's confusion between the party leaders and the parties, it is our reading of the Eu, Tashjian and Jones cases that the Court has recognized that parties have a structure and have the core constitutional right to create their own structure, and their leadership can make choices for the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.646" offset="5721335">So they can choose to endorse candidates, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.431" offset="5732411">They can choose to associate or not associate with particular individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.566" offset="5752995">And that's a choice that's made here by duly elected leaders of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.537" offset="5772849">And if there's a problem with that, the remedy for that problem is in the political arena.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.191" offset="5791448">The remedy is for the rank-and-file voters to vote their party leaders out when they come up for election if they adopt a process that they don't like or they think squelches the input of the rank-and-file members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.581" offset="5841080">So the reason that... the reason why that's not happening here, we believe, could be attributable to one of two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.687" offset="5877443">It could be attributable to apathy, which the Constitution does not have a prerogative to stamp out, or it could be attributable to party unity and the fact that leaders are sensitive to who will be best to advance the interests of their rank-and-file members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.447" offset="5936480">But we don't think there's a constitutional problem with that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3463.049" offset="14018870">That... that case focused on the fact that the statute was inhibiting the rights of an individual who wanted to participate in a way that the party wanted that individual to participate.</text>

            <text syncTime="3485.764" offset="14109776">But... and to the extent that it was... it was... part of that is answered by your Clingman case which just came relatively recently, where the party wanted independents to vote in the primary and the Supreme Court... this Court said that the State had to let that happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.776" offset="14173828">With respect to time periods between when you had to identify yourself as a party member this court held in the Rosario case that a certain length of time is appropriate under the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.417" offset="14220326">With respect to Mr. Dunne, we've heard about him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.286" offset="14231820">He may have had a desire to be a delegate but he never tried to get the 500 signatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.855" offset="14258151">It says that right on his... on page 19 of his brief... the brief that my colleague was quoting.</text>

            <text syncTime="3547.155" offset="14355327">If the parties wanted to select the delegates or select the candidates to be their standard bearers, that seems to me to be perfectly within the right of an association to do; and would be perfectly appropriate, provided that there was an access for independents and--</text>

            <text syncTime="3569.051" offset="14442889">But I think those hypothetical questions are could the State vest that authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.853" offset="14454174">Finally I think it's important to say... oh, one more preliminary point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.324" offset="14472042">It is competitive in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.609" offset="14481133">It may not be perfectly competitive, as is the case of 90 percent of the congressional districts in this country, which are said not to be competitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.430" offset="14512480">But in New York, six sitting judges testified in... in... in the lower court that they successfully lobbied delegates to, you know, to be candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.321" offset="14551977">So that happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.237" offset="14555634">Between 1900 and 2002, this is appendix 130, nearly one fourth of the general elections in New York were competitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.427" offset="14592414">Lopez Torres, the Respondent, received 25 votes at the 2002 judicial selection convention, and many of the districts in New York are not dominated by a single party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.650" offset="14641315">So the final point is it is important to emphasize this is a... a challenge on its face to the statute that simply creates a delegate election and it then creates a convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.910" offset="14694396">Neither of those provisions can possibly be constitutional, and so what the Respondents are complaining about is what party bosses do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.600" offset="14729087">But on page 38 of their brief, they state categorically that the constitutional offense is not the fact that party leaders act as one would expect in choosing nominees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.741" offset="14781645">In other words, they act... party leaders act like party leaders and exercise their influence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.894" offset="14802334">They're not saying that that's unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.179" offset="14815395">What they're saying is that a statute that allows party leaders to be party leaders, to be constitutional, to act in ways which are not only permissible under the Constitution as they knowledge, but constitutionally protected, is somehow constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3679.391" offset="14884254">That simply is not consistent with any of this Court's jurisprudence, which says that political parties must have the maximum opportunity to select their leadership.</text>
