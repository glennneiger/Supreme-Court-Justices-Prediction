            <text syncTime="343.502" offset="1544644">And that... this is reprinted on page 5a of the government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.063" offset="1562930">And the inference that I think, Justice Ginsburg, you're drawing and that the amicus would have you draw is that the fact that the subsection (f)(2), which is on page 6a, subsection (f)(2)(A) and (b) refer to whether the appeal has been filed; whereas, subsection (f)(1) says not, which means that, in some circumstances, the cross-appeal rule does not apply in circumstances such as that.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.522" offset="1656762">But our interpretation, which we think is the correct one, is that the only reason that subsection (f)(1) does not refer to whether an appeal has been filed is that subsection (f)(1) refers to the kind of claims that both defendants and the government can bring; whereas, subsection (f)(2) parallels subsections (a)(3) and (b)(3), but (c), only the defendant can appeal an upward departure; only the government can appeal a downward departure.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.635" offset="1777239">And our interpretation, again, which we think is the correct one, is that subsection (f)(1) doesn't need to refer to whether an appeal has been filed, because... because both the defendant and the government can bring those kinds of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.896" offset="1834290">And even if you don't agree with that interpretation, I think it's worth noting that the amicus... that the amicus's construction is further flawed for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.299" offset="1867831">And the first is that that would cause subsection (f)(2) to operate illogically.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.265" offset="1887684">There's no reason why the... for example, if you had a case in which the defendant had appealed and the government had not appealed, under this interpretation the court of appeals could increase a sentence if it found there had been a misapplication of the Guidelines that would result in an increase in the defendant's sentence; but the court of appeals would not be allowed to increase the defendant's sentence if it found that there was an unwarranted downward departure, because the government had filed a notice of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.863" offset="1990084">We don't think... that doesn't make any sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.551" offset="1996876">We don't think there's any reason why Congress would have intended for it to operate this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.628" offset="2009206">The second reason is that this is a very thin reed to rest this construction of the statute on, given that Congress must have been aware of the cross-appeal rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.764" offset="2053719">There's no reason to think that it would have departed from two centuries of appellate practice in this way, based on this... this very thin reed, and in fact we know from the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 that Congress was aware of the cross-appeal rule because in that case it expressly carved out that exception--</text>

            <text syncTime="1778.460" offset="7284478">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There are three questions really in this case, and the Court need not resolve all of them depending upon how it resolves the others, but some of them get lost sometimes, so I would like to state what the three are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.142" offset="7335260">The three are first, does section 3742 provide an answer?</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.702" offset="7361487">Is it an affirmative grant of power to the court of appeals to the Eighth Circuit to give the right answer when the Petitioner asked them is my sentence imposed in violation of law?</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.198" offset="7395446">Or is it a limit on the court's power telling them they cannot provide him with relief?</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.854" offset="7418120">That's the first question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.243" offset="7423658">If the Court concludes that it's neither... if a Court a court concludes either that it is a grant of jurisdiction, or rather a power... or that it's not, that it's an affirmative limit, then the... if the Court concludes that 3742 is more like 1291, just a general appellate statute that does not give the answer here, then the Court has to go on to decide is this case... is this rule, this cross-appeal rule, in the criminal context not the civil context that is... that is subject of this 200 years of discussion, but in the criminal context is it a jurisdictional limit on what the courts can do or is it a rule of practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.727" offset="7581542">And then finally, if the Court concludes... if the Court concludes it is a jurisdictional limit, then that's the end.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.740" offset="7605575">If the Court concludes that it is a rule of practice, the final third question is: Is it a waivable rule of practice or is it a firm and inflexible rule of practice?</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.331" offset="7647998">I think what often gets assumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.471" offset="7652491">But, of course, in Kontrick, in Bowles, the Court addresses the issue in that case... in those cases and decides whether the rule of practice at issue in that case--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="1880.372" offset="7692092">Mr. Jorgensen, suppose I think there's a larger anterior question to all of this?</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.477" offset="7728559">And that is what I suggested in the colloquy with Ms. Howe, we have a system in which the prosecutor can bring charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.271" offset="7767743">The judge may think, my goodness, looking at this set of facts, you could have charged much more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.612" offset="7793134">The judge can't do that, he can't tell the prosecutor you have to charge "Y" in addition to "X".</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.092" offset="7826989">The government chooses not to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.216" offset="7839528">Now, what right does the court say, I know you didn't appeal, Government, but should have so we're going to take care of it for you?</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.885" offset="7882159">It seems to me that our system rests on a principle of party presentation as many systems do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.053" offset="7914865">In many systems, the court does shape the controversy and can intrude issues on its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.159" offset="7943286">But in our adversarial system, we rely on counsel to do that kind of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.360" offset="7972125">So, my problem with your whole position, without getting down to particular statutory provisions, is what business does the court have to put an issue in the case that counsel chose not to raise?</text>

            <text syncTime="1963.572" offset="8024892">--The answer to that question, Justice Ginsburg, is multi-part, and I'll try to move through it quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.617" offset="8053105">This Court had said... made the very point that you made at the charging stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.005" offset="8074630">That at the charging stage the court... the district court cannot decide what a criminal will be charged with; but that once the trial has proceeded to judgment, that prosecutorial discretion is at an end.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.125" offset="8119142">I wish I could remember the name of the case, but Justice Scalia was the author.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jay T. Jorgensen</label>
            <text syncTime="1995.138" offset="8151221">The point being that once a crime has been proven, the law kicks in, and the defendant must be sentenced in accordance with lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.385" offset="8196151">The same is true on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.822" offset="8201898">I'm not advocating here for, I think, what your question would assume, which would be a roving court of jurisdiction... a roving court of appeals that could reach out and take jurisdiction over a case that has not been brought to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.082" offset="8242963">Under 3742 no one questions that the court has jurisdiction over the case, over the very sentencing issues because somebody has filed a notice of appeal and brought it to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.796" offset="8285804">The only question is when the defendant says to the court under 3742(a)(1) was my sentence imposed and the statutory languages in violation of law, can the Eighth Circuit provide the right answer or is it powerless to provide the right answer to only provide an answer that benefits him?</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="2045.556" offset="8352886">Could we discuss... let's leave aside for the moment what the background rule of law is and discuss whether... I guess it was your first point... whether this particular statute proscribes the answer, and therefore, we don't have to go any further.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.063" offset="8418924">Why do you say it proscribes the answer?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jay T. Jorgensen</label>
            <text syncTime="2063.846" offset="8426029">I believe that it does, Justice, because everybody agrees that the Sentencing Reform Act was a clean break with the past and imposed an entirely new regime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.404" offset="8460301">So, the talk about the regime of the past is somewhat beside the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.371" offset="8476184">So then you get down to the language itself of section 3742.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.963" offset="8490499">Under (a), it provides that a defendant may ask the court of appeals was my sentence imposed in violation of law; and under (b)(1), the government can raised same appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.599" offset="8537101">Then under (d), the parties certify to the court or bring to the court the record that they think addresses the issue that either side raised; and then in (e), the court... (e) says the court shall decide whether it was imposed in violation of law; and then (f)(1) says if the court determines that it was imposed in violation of law, it shall send it back with instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.574" offset="8632919">Now, the main answer to that is well, (f)(1)... you have to get all the way to (f)(1) before you have got the answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.462" offset="8660504">And that's unsurprising.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.351" offset="8664057">I don't think any member of the court would say that the Eighth Circuit lacks the power, is barred from noticing the 924(c) error here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.894" offset="8702195">Certainly the Eighth Circuit could see it; certainly the Eighth Circuit could say it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.893" offset="8714212">I see the error here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.565" offset="8720899">The only question is, can it provide the remedy?</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.439" offset="8732393">And that's what (f)(1) says.</text>

            <text syncTime="2142.219" offset="8739498">Well, why would... why would Congress want a different disposition for (f)(1) than for (f)(2)?</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.185" offset="8771368">It's clear under (f)(2) if the sentence is outside the applicable guidelines and the... or if the departure is based on an impermissible factor or is to an unreasonable degree or the sentence was imposed for an offense for which there is no applicable guideline and its plainly unreasonable, for that, it is clear that if it hasn't been raised by one or the other party, the court doesn't get into it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.235" offset="8883590">Why would it want a different rule for those two?</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.563" offset="8888919">In other words, I'm saying that far from supporting your case, as your brief suggests, (f)(2)(a) and (a) seems to me harms your case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2191.777" offset="8937715">First, the court is not in the practice of overturning what the plain language says on a sort of legislative history or surmising what Congress may have been motivated by.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.304" offset="8983900">But even if it were, there is a clear answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.413" offset="8992259">(F)(1) subsumes (a)(1) and (a)(2) and (b)(1) and (b)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.286" offset="9011799">And the questions under those statutes or rather those provisions are legal questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.829" offset="9041996">The kind of questions was this sentence imposed under (a)(1), (b)(1) in violation of law or (a)(2), (b)(2), was it an incorrect application of Sentencing Guidelines?</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.731" offset="9077627">If the court of appeals gets that wrong, that's the kind of thing that's going to be imposed in everybody else's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.761" offset="9097689">Under (3) and (4) it's this defendant's case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2242.710" offset="9141470">It says if the sentence is too high says the defendant's appeal, then what you do is you vacate it and send it back with such instructions as the court considers appropriate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2296.969" offset="9358496">So the question is, why would Congress say what is plainly said, which is under (f)(1) violations of law and incorrect applications of the Sentencing Guidelines, the court gives the right answer no matter who appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.591" offset="9401023">But under (f)(2) Congress specifies it matters under this who appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.432" offset="9420354">And the reason is, in those instances, it is too high in this defendant's case, and this defendant can be entrusted to forward his own cause; but under (a)(1) and (a)(2), then you get a court of appeals precedent that gives the wrong answer, if a question of law or the application of the Sentencing Guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.627" offset="9497154">So there is a difference between (a)(1), (a)(2), (b)(1), (b)(2) as--</text>

            <text syncTime="2350.651" offset="9573222">So that (f)(1) assumes that if it's the government appealing in violation of law because the defendant was given too little, or if it's the defendant appealing because in violation of law that he was given too much, it makes much more sense that way, it seems to me.</text>

            <text syncTime="2531.377" offset="10296187">Then the Court confronts the question of, is the cross-appeal rule jurisdictional or a rule of practice?</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.468" offset="10324504">Now, the Court has provided the answer to that once in, I believe it said, Langnes, and said that it is a rule of practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.980" offset="10350626">And then since, there's been obviously a long period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.776" offset="10369748">And then the Court has had its series of cases contra Bowles, Arbaugh.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.570" offset="10388974">And under those cases, there is no good argument that it's jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.897" offset="10402244">The teachings of those cases is that the Court has used the phrases "power" and "jurisdiction" too broadly, too loosely, and is now, as you say, trying to cut back on those jurisdictional limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.892" offset="10450205">And a rule like this can only be jurisdictional if it's based on a statute, and I believe all the parties agree this rule is not based on a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.594" offset="10472984">So then that gets us finally to the question of, if 3742 does not provide the answer and it is a rule of practice, is it a mandatory rule of practice, an inflexible rule of practice?</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.637" offset="10509242">Or one where the Court can use discretion as to whether or not to apply it when it's invoked?</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.883" offset="10538186">And the... there can be no question that there are discretionary rules of practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.413" offset="10560337">Indeed, in Bowles, the one issue on which all nine Justices agreed is just that: Justice Souter, writing for the dissent, would have found that that rule or practice was discretionary.</text>

            <text syncTime="2693.578" offset="10944964">So the normal way to handle it is just what we said: The judge decides on the record and the appeal... I decide this for the defendant here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3340.321" offset="13531923">The idea that Congress was aware of a clear rule that they would have followed, I think, is contradicted by Reynolds, where this Court did the opposite; Langnes, where this Court said that the cross-appeal rule was a rule of practice, not a jurisdictional limit; and the confusion in the courts of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.719" offset="13617500">I believe the answer to your question, justice Scalia, on whether it is well-established is that in the civil context I believe the D.C. Third, Fourth, Eighth, and Ninth Circuits say that this is a rule of practice while the Senate has debated it back and forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.149" offset="13683224">And in Neztsosie the Court noted this confusion and noted, indeed, that some of the circuits are internally inconsistent as to what the rule is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.786" offset="13713839">It is slightly different in the criminal context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.021" offset="13722721">I believe the Eighth and the Tenth Circuits have not followed... have not followed the rule, while the Second, Third, Fourth and Seventh have; and the Fifth is internally inconsistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.845" offset="13758039">I may... I may have some error, honestly, in that recitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.047" offset="13770891">I did it from memory when you asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.889" offset="13778205">But my point, I think, comes through no matter what, which is: How could Congress have assumed this is a clear rule and, when we write these words, the courts will know that's what we mean, when there's all this confusion amongst the courts?</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.759" offset="13829719">Thank you, Your Honors.</text>

            <text syncTime="3417.634" offset="13841212">Ms. Howe, you have two minutes remaining.</text>

            <label>Ms. Amy Howe</label>
            <text syncTime="3420.586" offset="13853020">Mr. Chief Justice, I have two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.413" offset="13864305">The first is that the amicus argues that subsection (e) of section 3742 provides the answer in this case: That upon a review of the record the Court of Appeals shall determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.783" offset="13909758">And so his argument is that this authorizes and, in fact, requires the court of appeals to determine whether any of the errors that are outlined in subsection (e) have occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.545" offset="13948837">But (e) can't possibly be this sort empowering, roving, free-standing authority that the amicus believes it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.636" offset="13977154">Because if you look at the language of subsection (e), all it provides... and this Court has recognized that it merely provides the scope of review... that, upon review of the record, the court of appeals shall determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.335" offset="14023965">It doesn't say anything about whether a notice of appeal has been filed, how the record got there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.739" offset="14045595">And to figure out those things you have to look at the structure of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.534" offset="14052804">And when you look at the structure of the statute, it is clear that subsections (a) and (b) are the provisions that provide for appellate jurisdiction in sentencing cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.827" offset="14090003">Amicus also tries to argue that, you know--</text>

            <text syncTime="3491.260" offset="14135665">--(2)(A) and (B) because in some of those cases it doesn't determine that if the appeal has been brought by the wrong party.</text>

            <label>Ms. Amy Howe</label>
            <text syncTime="3496.634" offset="14157190">--That's absolutely right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.836" offset="14161996">That merely provides the remedy, Justice Scalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.711" offset="14169519">And the amicus tries also to argue that this is not some sort of free-standing, roving appellate authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.724" offset="14193552">That, you know, for example, if the case is brought under (A)(1), a violation of law, the court of appeals only needs to determine whether it is a violation of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.159" offset="14223332">But he also argued that the court of appeals is not obligated to scour the record for errors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.674" offset="14237333">It is only to notice plain error.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.876" offset="14246110">But if one should start placing these limits, these limits come from subsections (a) and (b) and the background of traditional appellate practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.339" offset="14291981">And once you start placing these limits which do not appear in the text on subsection (e), the entire construction falls apart.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.150" offset="14307237">The second point I would make is that the amicus argues that, somehow, section 3742 represents as a break from the past; that Congress did not have in mind the background of this well-established appellate procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.443" offset="14356452">But in section 3742 Congress made clear... may I finish... it was only providing for limited appellate review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.675" offset="14377350">And if you are going to treat sentencing cases differently in light of this court's historic practice of construing the availability of government appeals narrow rate, you need to treat... you need to be even more reluctant to deviate--</text>
