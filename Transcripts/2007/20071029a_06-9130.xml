            <label>Mr. Jean-Claude Andre</label>
            <text syncTime="8.090" offset="202541">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court: The text of Section 2680(c) of the Federal Tort claims act establishes... provision underlying purpose confirm that Congress did not intend the provision to broadly bar all claims arising out of all the tensions of all property by all law enforcement officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.114" offset="282685">As in any statutory construction case we need to of course begin with the text, and with respect to the text in this case, we believe that the statutory language is simply no different than the statutory at issue at Circuit City v. Adams.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.593" offset="336602">Circuit City v. Adams this court applied a ejusdem generis to limit a sweepingly broad residual phrase that is meaningfully indistinguishable from the "any other law enforcement phrase" at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.276" offset="383309">In particular, in Circuit City the court was asked what kinds of employment contracts were exempted from the mandates of the Federal Arbitration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.196" offset="414969">The particular provision at issue in that case 9 U.S.C. Section 1 exempted from the act's coverage any and I quote contracts of employment of sea men, railroad employees or any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.892" offset="473797">That residual phrase read in isolation is broad and sweeping on its face it certainly would appear to apply not only to transportation workers, but also to retail store clerks like the Respondent in Circuit City, none the less under a ejusdem generis, this court limited that residual phrase to just to transportation workers.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="92.932" stopTime="119.031">
            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="92.932" offset="541924">I suppose there is a difference between a sufficient laundry list in a residual phrase and example in a residual phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.569" offset="580481">In Circuit City you have a couple of examples... seamen, railroad workers... here it's just a customs or excise worker.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.752" offset="609216">I regard customs and excise as kind of the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.126" offset="622695">So why isn't it more like the cases where we've said you have an example in a residual phrase; the example is not limiting.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jean_claude_andre" startTime="119.031" stopTime="213.760">
            <label>Mr. Jean-Claude Andre</label>
            <text syncTime="119.031" offset="646310">Well, first of all, Your Honor, if I could point out that if the Government had made the argument that you have to have a list, and I think under the Government's interpretation you had to have at least three items, two specific and one general.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.338" offset="691554">In Norfolk... Norfolk and Western Railway, this Court says that need not be the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.900" offset="709839">There the Court said that you could have a singular general term preceded by a singular specific term.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.210" offset="735021">So it's our position that... that even if you were to read this statute as... as possessing only two items, that you could still apply ejusdem generis, but we don't read the statute that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.784" offset="777340">We believe that the statute actually contains a list of three items, and that Congress to save itself a couple words, decided to say</text>
            <text syncTime="158.626" offset="804716">"any officer of customs or excise, or any other law enforcement officer. "</text>
            <text syncTime="163.498" offset="824151">instead of saying the more wordy version,</text>
            <text syncTime="166.653" offset="836794">"any officer of customs, any officer of excise or any other law enforcement officer. "</text>
            <text syncTime="172.526" offset="860305">I don't think we can fault Congress for its pick in that scenario.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.352" offset="875560">To get back to the residual phrase, the</text>
            <text syncTime="179.602" offset="888621">"any other law enforcement officer phrase. "</text>
            <text syncTime="181.647" offset="896772">here, ripped from its moorings, as we believe the Government is trying to do, would certainly seem to apply to all law enforcement officers, including Bureau of Prisons officials which by statute are law enforcement officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.377" offset="939717">But Section 2680(c) contains a number of contextual cues that Congress didn't have general law enforcement functions in mind when it passed the provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.312" offset="975452">It had customs and tax functions in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.263" offset="991230">In particular, the detention clause preserves sovereign immunity for the detention of goods and merchandise by any officer of customs or excise.</text>

            <text syncTime="213.760" offset="1025294">Well, not just goods or merchandise.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.087" offset="1034594">Goods, merchandise or other property.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.430" offset="1043893">And does other property include any type of property?</text>

            <text syncTime="222.583" offset="1060507">We believe it does, and we believe that when Congress added that language it was simply Congress's sensible recognition that customs and tax officers will detain or seize cash and real property which wouldn't be covered or wouldn't be subsumed under goods and merchandise.</text>

            <text syncTime="241.937" offset="1137934">are just examples, and then a residual phrase that includes everything; but</text>
            <text syncTime="245.996" offset="1154234">"customs or excise or any other law enforcement officer. "</text>
            <text syncTime="249.401" offset="1167818">that's subject to ejusdem generis... all in the same sentence.</text>

          <turn speaker="jean_claude_andre" startTime="253.681" stopTime="389.893">
            <label>Mr. Jean-Claude Andre</label>
            <text syncTime="253.681" offset="1184954">Well, we actually don't think... or I guess I cannot necessarily agree with the first part of what you just said, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.772" offset="1217242">We don't believe that... that other property necessarily, or that</text>
            <text syncTime="265.178" offset="1230930">"goods and merchandise and other property. "</text>
            <text syncTime="267.880" offset="1241692">the goods and merchandise are examples of "other property".</text>
            <text syncTime="270.894" offset="1253813">We think in that situation, goods and merchandise refer specifically to goods and merchandise as... as explained historically in the United States Code, which are, you know, more movable things other than cash, tangible items other than cash, and "other property" then covers cash and real property.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.308" offset="1323403">Excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.431" offset="1343883">Getting back to the contextual cues in this case, in addition to the four contained in the detention clause itself, the assessment clause contains four additional contextual cues.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.490" offset="1384112">It preserves sovereign immunity for the assessment of any tax or the collection of any customs duty, and because we have this great quantity of contextual cues in a very short statutory provision, we believe that we would also prevail under an application of the Noscitur a sociis canon, that this Court most recently applied two terms ago in Dolan v. Postal Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.528" offset="1464360">In that case what was at issue is whether the term 2680(b) of the Federal Tort Claims Act reached all negligent transmissions, in particular a parcel left on the foot of someone's front door that causes them a fall injury, or instead, it was limited by its antecedent contextual cues, namely... I'm sorry... namely, loss and miscarriage, which would tend to indicate that Congress intended really only to preserve sovereign immunity for instances in which delivery was untimely or went to the wrong location.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.294" offset="1623394">The Court again sensibly looked past the superficially broad negligent transmission language and instead said no, we have to read it in context; and in context Congress did not intend us to just pluck those two words out of the dictionary and apply a dictionary meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.584" offset="1692566">In fact, in that case, the Government implored this Court to apply dictionary definitions to negligence and transmission, and that's essentially what the Government is trying to ask this Court to do here.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="406.057" offset="1794443">I mean it clearly, the exception to the exception says that... that the exception is applicable to any claim based on injury or loss of goods or merchandise, if among other requirements, the property was seized for the purpose of forfeiture under any provision of Federal law providing for the forfeiture of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.547" offset="1900396">Now that's more than customs and tax... any provision of Federal law.</text>

            <text syncTime="438.498" offset="1924220">Why do you need that exception to the exception if the exception doesn't cover anything except customs and tax in the first place?</text>

            <text syncTime="446.465" offset="1956089">--Well, we believe that the fact that Congress decided to not only preserve the detention clause, but also mimic its language in the exception to the exception, means that Congress intended to kind of bring forward the... of course... original meaning as of 1946 of that clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.270" offset="2019305">But I think to get what you're asking me, the Government's position, that because the exception to the exception references any provision of forfeiture... the Government's suggestion that that somehow broadens the scope of the statute is misplaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.263" offset="2079283">Customs and tax officers regularly apply other forfeiture statutes, and in particular the one they use a lot is 21 U.S.C. 881.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.542" offset="2112406">That's the general civil forfeiture statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.651" offset="2120765">And so in many cases they will bring a forfeiture action under either their agency's specific forfeiture provision, or the general 21 U.S.C. 881.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.209" offset="2163083">And so when Congress included that language saying any provision of forfeiture, it was simply Congress's sensible recognition that they don't--</text>

            <text syncTime="522.777" offset="2261304">It seems to me that that envisions seizure under laws other than tax and customs.</text>

            <text syncTime="545.988" offset="2354195">It's kind of the backbone of all forfeitures, and so in many cases officers bring forfeiture actions not only either... either under their own agency forfeiture provision or the general.</text>

            <text syncTime="560.091" offset="2410515">But the point is that's a meaty statute there, and I... I assume that Congress wanted to make clear that if a customs or tax officer were to bring a forfeiture proceeding under that meaty provision, and maybe some other ones that they would use from time to time, that the exception to the exception would still work here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1268.856" offset="5245637">I think it's pretty clear that this text is ambiguous, and so legislative history is relevant to give that text meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.698" offset="5269043">And so the reason why we focus here on those particular committee reports is, as the Court of Appeals has stated, the committee reports are the most helpful form of legislative history because when many members of Congress go up to vote, they haven't parsed particular provisions in the text; they rely on the committee reports, the reports prepared by the committee that marked up and presented the language to the floor.</text>

            <text syncTime="1393.135" offset="5742695">So, yes, Justice Ginsburg, in that particular case, if you're dealing with an officer of customs or tax or another law enforcement acting in that capacity, and they were sued personally for the negligent handling of property, the government could certify they're acting within the scope of their employment, step into the case, and then move to dismiss under this provision, under 2680(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.516" offset="5824301">But, historically, there was... before the Westfall Act, there was a pre-existing federally funded remedy for only officers acting in a tax or customs capacity or customs or tax officers by name.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.465" offset="5872053">And so it would be inconsistent with Congress's underlying purpose to avoid creating a duplicative remedy to apply its provisions so broadly because Congress wanted to provide a cause of action for claims against law enforcement officers other than those against whom a cause of action was already available.</text>

            <text syncTime="2348.408" offset="9563782">Well, we do believe that it is a rare occurrence, but in some sense, Justice Ginsburg, I think that the answer to that question depends on exactly what it is that Petitioner means when he says that an officer is acting in a customs or tax capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.371" offset="9623655">And with the Court's leave, I'd like to offer at least three possible explanations for what that means and then explain why each of them would be an erroneous interpretation for this Court to adopt, and each of these three explanations I should add, appear at various points in Petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.895" offset="9693767">The first is that an officer is acting in a customs or tax capacity when the officer is actually acting in a revenue collecting capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.626" offset="9728667">And we believe that if the Court were to adopt that limitation, there really are no actual cases of which we are aware that would fall within that language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.482" offset="9768164">And indeed, it would cast some doubt on the meaning of the preceding phrase</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.402" offset="9791779">"any officer of customs or excise. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.324" offset="9795541">because one might very well wonder whether under Petitioner's construction that phrase should also be limited to a revenue collecting capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.118" offset="9826678">The second possible explanation is that an officer is acting in a customs or tax capacity when the officer is more generally acting to enforce the customs or tax laws, that is to say, the provisions of Title 19 or 26 of the United States Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.251" offset="9891253">But we believe that that interpretation, too, would suffer from the same two deficiencies that I've already identified and would also suffer from a third, namely, to the extent that Petitioner relies for his noscitur a sociis argument on the assessment of taxes clause, that limitation would actually sweep more broadly than the mere assessment of taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.946" offset="9970038">So the third possible interpretation and the one that we're left with, I think, is that an officer is acting in a customs or tax capacity whenever the officer is actually performing a function that is performed by customs or excise Internal Revenue officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.830" offset="10037539">But if anything, that limitation would exclude only a very small number of cases apart from cases in the prison context such as this one, because as Petitioner himself recognizes, customs officers have virtually plenary authority to enforce the criminal provisions of the United States Code.</text>

            <text syncTime="2564.635" offset="10428749">And we believe that, at most, that phrase would have to refer to an Internal Revenue officer acting in an excise-collecting capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.772" offset="10465320">But, to the extent that "excise officer" has a narrower meaning than "Internal Revenue officer", we believe that that actually supports our construction, because it would have been quite peculiar for Judge Holtzoff and Congress to have referred only to an excise officer and not to an Internal Revenue officer if they had meant to limit the residual phrase "any other law-enforcement officer" to officers acting in a customs or tax capacity.</text>

            <text syncTime="3207.428" offset="12999929">First of all, any claimant who claims that a Federal agency, including a Federal law enforcement agency negligently damaged his or her property, would have a claim under 31 U.S.C. 3723 for up to $1,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.843" offset="13065549">That statute, which we cite in a footnote, I believe in our brief, would cover the vast majority of claims involving the Bureau of Prisons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.277" offset="13095328">There's actually another Federal statute, 31 U.S.C. 3724, which provides a further remedy against the Department of Justice for up to $50,000 for personal injury or property damage caused by a law enforcement officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.990" offset="13158127">And critically, that statute expressly makes clear that it applies where the FTCA does not.</text>

            <text syncTime="3267.233" offset="13239106">As we note in our brief, there were 12,000 such claims over the last three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.605" offset="13256661">The Bureau of Prisons has procedures for processing those claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.760" offset="13273274">It paid out something in the neighborhood of 1,100 of those claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.087" offset="13286545">And there's no reason to think that the Bureau of Prisons would alter those procedures if the Court were to hold in this case that there is no judicial remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.319" offset="13315488">Indeed, the Bureau of Prisons has paid out on such claims even in circuits that have adopted our interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.613" offset="13340670">I do want to say just a word about the underlying policy considerations, because to the extent that members of the Court feel that the statute is ambiguous, we believe that they strongly support our construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.186" offset="13382989">In Kosak, this Court analyzed two other policy considerations in addition to the avoidance of duplicative remedies: First, protecting important government functions from the threat of suit; and second, avoiding exposure to fraudulent claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.573" offset="13440458">And we believe that those concerns are particularly implicated in the prison context which constitutes the mine run of cases in this area.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jean-Claude Andre</label>
            <text syncTime="3331.144" offset="13494793">I'd like to first address the government's resistance to making any concession that the statute is ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.514" offset="13540246">First of all, if the statutory language in this case was so clear, then so must the statutory language in Circuit City.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.729" offset="13573160">The language had started out with the words "any other", and clearly then were followed by words that have a very plain meaning out of context,</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.180" offset="13602940">"any worker engaged in interstate or foreign commerce. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.351" offset="13615583">We just don't believe that the government's position that the statute is unambiguous can be squared with that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.991" offset="13634182">Nor do we think as a factual matter that the statute is unambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.863" offset="13653617">In particular, we think it would have been strange for this Court in Kosak to go out of its way in a footnote and expressly decline to resolve today's question presented if the detention of property clause, in particular the "law enforcement officer" phrase, had only one clear meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.997" offset="13718192">And then on top of that, as we noted in our reply brief, five courts of appeals have adopted our construction; two other circuit judges have written separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.884" offset="13753718">The total is 16 circuit judges that have found our position to be credible, found the statute to be ambiguous, applied the canons of construction that we are urging the Court to apply today, and then resolved the case in our favor So if, if the statute is truly unambiguous, then those 16 circuit judges not only got this issue wrong, they got it very wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.784" offset="13825294">Justice Breyer, I unfortunately don't have an example either of what other types of law enforcement officers were out there at the time of the FTCA's enactment, but I do have one example, and that would be the Elliott Ness and the Al Capone investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.574" offset="13888510">Elliott Ness was in charge of running a group of... in charge of supervising a group of government agents who were part of the Department of Justice, even though Elliott Ness himself was a treasury agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.975" offset="13942114">And they were all trying enforce the Volstead Act, but... to get Al Capone on charges of income tax evasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.816" offset="13973461">And so we believe that that's a nice example from the early 1930s when Judge Holtzoff drafted this language that shows that you could have a revenue officer working with... in fact, supervising other law enforcement officers, and they are all really doing the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.387" offset="14031766">As far as the policy considerations are concerned, we believe that the government's reliance on the two other general purposes for the FTCA exceptions just prove too much.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.866" offset="14089653">Pretty much any governmental function is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.256" offset="14099266">And so the government in every brief they filed on this issue below and in pretty much every FTCA exception case that we've seen has come in and said, oh, but our interests are served by these two other purposes, and therefore, this statutory exemption has to be construed narrowly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.423" offset="14155900">Again, as a factual matter, we don't think that their concerns are really all that well founded, in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.138" offset="14178783">True, there were 12,000 administrative claims filed by Federal prisoners over the last three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.559" offset="14200412">But as we pointed out in footnote 12 of our cert petition, there were only 16 cases filed in all of 2006 by Federal prisoners under this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.850" offset="14241581">settlement process is working, and that also Federal prisoners are just not bringing suit and there is a very good reason for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.129" offset="14270734">That it's the Federal filing fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.238" offset="14279198">That's $455.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.003" offset="14286198">My client's claim in this case is $177.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.548" offset="14300409">Prisoners don't evaluate whether to sue based on some sophisticated reading of sovereign immunity doctrines and ambiguous statutory text.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.934" offset="14333950">They, you know, they think about their wallet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.762" offset="14345235">They make $2.50 a day, and it's just not worth it for them to risk--</text>

            <text syncTime="3558.584" offset="14404585">So they still make a very real calculation when they decide whether to sue based on how much is at stake and how much is it going to cost me.</text>

            <text syncTime="3573.110" offset="14462682">There was $177 at stake and so perhaps my client shouldn't have sued because it didn't make a lot of sense, although he also did file the suit a couple years earlier when the filing fee was lower.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.792" offset="14501343">But in our experience, prisoners they are not going to typically sue for these kinds of claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.338" offset="14523599">This is nothing like the Prison Litigation Reform Act problem we had in Jones V. Bock, where there are 24,000 cases coming before the Federal courts every year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.724" offset="14557141">That's just not something we envisioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.115" offset="14562678">So we don't think that adopting any one of the four constructions discussed are debated between my friend and Justice Souter would somehow open up the floodgates here and lead to a lot of prisoners suing under this particular provision.</text>
