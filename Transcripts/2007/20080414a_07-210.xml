            <text syncTime="7.838" offset="190142">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Both parts of the question presented in this case should be answered "yes".</text>
            <text syncTime="15.540" offset="220862">For a treble damage civil RICO claim based on fraud, someone must rely on the alleged misrepresentation, and that someone must be the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.691" offset="257538">But that's the very nature of a fraud claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.332" offset="268091">Plaintiffs here claim that they were injured by reason of a RICO violation, the predicate acts of which involved a scheme or artifice to defraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.374" offset="304245">But no one in this case is arguing that a civil RICO claim based on fraud can proceed without someone relying.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.669" offset="337368">So some reliance is required; the only question is who must rely?</text>
            <text syncTime="49.321" offset="356072">And we submit that the natural answer is the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.944" offset="370491">A plaintiff who hasn't relied to his detriment on an alleged misrepresentation hasn't been defrauded; he hasn't been injured by reason of a scheme to defraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.676" offset="409466">Plaintiffs here haven't alleged that they relied on any misrepresentation; they haven't even alleged that they received a misrepresentation.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="69.610" offset="437156">So what about a case, say, you've got organized crime wants to get rid of... an organized crime enterprise wants to get rid of rivals, so it makes misrepresentations about those rivals to customers and suppliers, not to the... to the rival.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.599" offset="525136">So there was no... there is no misrepresentation made to the plaintiff but to the plaintiff's customers and suppliers.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.613" offset="557215">So on your theory, is there no RICO claim because the misrepresentation was made to someone other than the plaintiff?</text>

            <text syncTime="106.422" offset="584382">Yes, that's correct, Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.812" offset="593995">There would be a criminal RICO prosecution because, under the Neder case, we know that reliance, justifiable reliance, and injury is not required.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="124.726" offset="657629">But that doesn't even comport with common-law civil cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.008" offset="674766">I mean, for a long time courts have allowed someone who's been euchred by a competitor's misrepresentations to his customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.984" offset="718651">An old New York case that was discussed in the briefs that I used to teach in contracts class, where he told somebody that the horse was no longer for sale and it was still for sale, and the person who wanted to sell the horse at the higher price should have... to buy the horse should have had a cause of action, even though the representation was not made to him.</text>

            <text syncTime="163.679" offset="813424">Justice Scalia, those cases as well as the Rice versus Manley New York case, the cheese buyer's case, similar situation, do exist, but they are really tortious interference with business expectancy cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.361" offset="868176">And we believe that the law makes that clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.407" offset="880402">When RICO was enacted in 1970, the law even in New York, as we point out in our reply brief, had evolved to the extent where... where there were some references to fraud in those early cases in the 19th century.</text>

            <text syncTime="204.225" offset="975592">Is that a violation of the mail fraud statute?</text>

            <text syncTime="210.270" offset="999833">But I will say, Justice Kennedy, that the government's position here seeks to extend the mail fraud statute far beyond what this Court did in Neder.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.314" offset="1039957">As a matter of fact, the government made the exact same argument in Neder as it did to this Court, and the Court--</text>

            <text syncTime="226.562" offset="1065035">In my... in my hypothetical, there was no... there was no reliance on anything said.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.013" offset="1086769">It was just used to facilitate the scheme.</text>

            <text syncTime="236.494" offset="1104741">--I think that in criminal mail fraud, reliance is not required, Justice Kennedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.035" offset="1126893">And that's what the Neder Court held.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.036" offset="1134939">But in doing so, it looked to the common law and imposed a materiality requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.049" offset="1158971">And the only reason that the Neder case ruled that it's not required in criminal mail fraud is because no one has to be injured; there does not have to be a completed scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.357" offset="1208186">Civil... there is, of course, no private right of action in mail fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.086" offset="1235040">And when we look to whether or not someone has a civil claim under RICO through the predicate act of mail fraud, we have to go through 1964(c), the "injured by reason of" requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.438" offset="1288539">As this Court found in Holmes, the common-law requirement of proximate cause applies, we submit so does the common-law element of reliance, justifiable reliance, apply in a civil RICO case predicated on mail fraud.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="298.669" offset="1353427">Well, isn't... isn't the difference that, in Holmes, it was the textual basis "by reason of" through which the... as we read it... the proximate cause standard was... was brought into the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.489" offset="1416748">Here, in fact, there... there isn't any text, it seems to me, that you can... can rely on.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.020" offset="1442870">The fact of fraud itself doesn't do it because the statute speaks in terms of an offense for which an individual should be prosecuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.562" offset="1481009">So it's looking to the criminal rather than the civil model.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.842" offset="1494070">And isn't that the distinction, in effect, a textual distinction, between Holmes as a means for importing proximate cause and the statute in this case as a means for importing first-party reliance?</text>

            <label>Mr. Theodore M. Becker</label>
            <text syncTime="347.241" offset="1547673">Well, Justice Souter, of course, in Holmes the Court was looking at the "injured by reason of" language and looked to the Clayton Act and looked to the Sherman Act before it, where Congress used precisely the same language.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.080" offset="1603053">Certainly RICO doesn't have proximate cause in its text at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.500" offset="1624787">The reason... the very reason that the common law does apply when you are construing a mail fraud predicate act through a civil RICO claim is because Congress has not told us what "defraud" means.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.447" offset="1684555">It has not defined "scheme to defraud", and of course that's--</text>

            <text syncTime="416.196" offset="1823526">I think the phrase here is "could be prosecuted or indicted" for something... I think it was prosecution... which tends to narrow it down to the criminal model, rather than allowing us to roam into the civil field.</text>

            <text syncTime="429.724" offset="1877652">Except, Justice Souter, that the... the requirement that there need to be an indictable offense is not enough to make out a civil fraud because criminal law recognizes a... an uncompleted fraud, simply a scheme, where here, if you're talking about a completed fraud, for someone to be injured by reason of a fraud, it has to be completed and someone has had to rely on it.</text>

            <text syncTime="484.012" offset="2094782">In the Salinas case, which was a criminal RICO case, the Court ruled that it was not necessary to have a wrongful overt act in order to make out a criminal cause of action for conspiracy under the RICO statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.304" offset="2179941">And the reason was because all you need is the agreement and any acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.489" offset="2204705">This was a situation where a sheriff actually was the wrongdoer, but the deputy sheriff took some innocent acts that were in furtherance of conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.874" offset="2242217">The Court said that's conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.076" offset="2255069">However, in the Beck versus Prupis case, the Court said that for civil RICO cause of action based on conspiracy, you need to look at the combination between 1964(c), the "injured by reason of" language, and the actual statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.583" offset="2337094">And since conspiracy is not defined in the RICO statute, the Court looked to the common law, and the common law requires that there needs to be an unlawful overt act or tortious act in order to make out a common-law cause of action for conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.982" offset="2406684">And the Court ruled that that was necessary.</text>

            <text syncTime="889.597" offset="3717091">I think it comes into play in the reliance concept under proximate causation.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.315" offset="3736003">And what we are asking the Court to do is to recognize that, in the context of a civil RICO claim based on fraud, that there is... there is nothing that is... that is revolutionary about finding that a reliance requirement should be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.167" offset="3799428">This case, as the Court knows, was originally dismissed by Chief Judge Holderman on that very basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.135" offset="3827327">If we have... if we were to accept... if the Court were to accept our opponents' position, a remarkable array of lawsuits could be brought as RICO actions: Competitor versus competitor for harm that allegedly is caused by false statements to customers, suppliers, distributors, marketing agencies, government entities; consumer or end user versus manufacturer for harm allegedly resulting from false statements to the first buyer in a distribution chain.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.918" offset="3950416">And the circuit court cases in the Fifth... Fourth and Fifth and Sixth and Eighth and Eleventh circuits have recognized this, and they require reliance as a part of proximate causation, and we believe this Court should do the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.052" offset="4010916">I also wanted to make the point that to elaborate, in the Neder case, the Government... and this is a case where the Government ostensibly argues that it wants us not to restrict civil RICO claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.546" offset="4068908">But in the Neder case the Government made the very same argument in trying to expand mail fraud claims under the criminal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.324" offset="4104016">And I think that's... that's a sub rosa issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.635" offset="4125332">The Court nine years ago specifically said in a unanimous opinion, with Chief Justice Rehnquist writing for the Court, that the Court disagreed that mail fraud was moored to the common law of fraud, and it is not unmoored in the Neder case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.879" offset="4194295">They said it was moored, and even in a criminal prosecution materiality is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.843" offset="4214148">And although justifiable reliance and injury is not required in a criminal prosecution, to unmoor the mail fraud statute in a civil RICO context and to then make the argument that all sorts of other claims can... can also be included such as tortious interference... because at its heart this is a tortious interference case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.958" offset="4318534">We know that because the Plaintiffs pled it in their complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.068" offset="4335043">That's their pendant State court action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.471" offset="4344656">And that's where this case should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.376" offset="4356255">It should be a tortious interference case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.455" offset="4364614">If they can prove that case and if they have pled it, then they have a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.359" offset="4384153">If they can't, they don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.607" offset="4389169">But the problem is that to give the civil RICO tool, to call "racketeers"... to call your competitor a "racketeer" and to seek treble damages and attorney's fees in this kind of such an attenuated situation, should not be something that the Court condones.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.414" offset="4464402">And it's different; if you Google my clients, you'll come up... they will come up as racketeers now, and... and that's the problem that we have.</text>

            <text syncTime="1135.153" offset="4699399">I think the reason, if one were to ask me why my client hasn't been indicted for mail fraud, is because they didn't commit it, because the county in its own rule... the treasurer wrote the rule and expressly says in the rule that she has the exclusive discretion to determine whether or not there has been a violation of the rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="1248.672" offset="5153407">I submit the central issue in this case is whether on those facts Respondents can establish proximate cause, and specifically whether in order to do so they must establish that they personally received and relied upon the false statements at issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="2107.147" offset="8587360">One of the principal motivations behind RICO was to protect legitimate businesses that are injured in their business or property by reason of a pattern of racketeering activity as defined under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.172" offset="8639396">That's number one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.065" offset="8643053">Number two, there are important restrictions that this Court repeatedly has recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.498" offset="8664787">It's not enough that there be a single act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.654" offset="8673355">There must be predicate acts that are a pattern of activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.980" offset="8686625">"Pattern" doesn't just mean two.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.279" offset="8691850">It means a continuing threat of continuing criminal activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.401" offset="8708359">There must be proximate cause under Holmes and Anza.</text>

            <text syncTime="2174.683" offset="8857466">Many bidders... over 50 percent of all the registered bidders receive fewer than 10 liens.</text>

            <text syncTime="2335.788" offset="9501855">It's a very rigorous test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.566" offset="9508960">This Court looked at directness; it looked to the suitability of other plaintiffs; it looked to whether the harm was derivative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.455" offset="9532575">That's a quintessential proximate cause analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.578" offset="9545009">Proximate cause is, historically through the common law, a very fact-based intensive test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.451" offset="9568519">But the Court has made clear that the ability of the RICO plaintiff to overcome that test, it's a significant showing that must be met.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.542" offset="9600911">Chief Judge Easterbrook, in this case, went through the Anza factors very methodically.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.557" offset="9620973">He showed that, under each factor, proximate cause clearly can be met under the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.273" offset="9643856">The Respondents were directly injured in a significant and substantial way, and that is sufficient, I submit, to make out the elements of the RICO claim, assuming all the other elements are also met.</text>

            <text syncTime="2406.556" offset="9784917">Now, when the RICO violation is predicated on an act of mail fraud, the plaintiff ordinarily will need to show that somebody relied on the false statements in order to establish that the fraud was even a "but for" cause of injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.114" offset="9831206">A plaintiff who can establish that it was the one who relied on the false statements would be able to show proximate causation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.845" offset="9858165">But that's not the only way to establish proximate causation, and there is no basis for this... for the imposition of a per se rule requiring that the plaintiff be the one who has relied.</text>

            <text syncTime="2460.062" offset="9999017">Again, since this came up after the briefing, one illustrative example is in the Eighth Circuit, Iconco against Jensen Construction Company, which is 622 F. 2d 1291.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.272" offset="10059830">In that case, it was a contract that was set aside for small businesses, and the company got the contract by falsely claiming to be a small business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.582" offset="10097028">And then in a diversity case applying Iowa law, the Eighth Circuit held that the disappointed bidder could bring an action for fraud and unjust enrichment against the successful bidder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.609" offset="10141228">So I think that... and that's of a piece with the long common-law tradition, going back to cases like Rice against Manley, where--</text>

            <text syncTime="2593.693" offset="10533482">But certainly the recovery for disappointed bidders in cases like this, does have a long common-law tradition, and with the more modern elaboration of tort law, as demonstrated by the secondary statement, it has sometimes been given a different label, and that is either "injurious falsehood" or</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.016" offset="10610805">"intentional interference with a prospective contractual relation. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.155" offset="10623344">but at its heart, the action that's at issue here is one that's for fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.386" offset="10648317">But I would like to say in response to some of Justice Alito's questions that, with respect to the Beck case and the relevance of it, that ultimately in our view it doesn't really matter whether the common law would have allowed recovery in this case, and that's because, unlike in Beck where the Court had to consider what is the meaning of... what does it mean to be injured by reason of a conspiracy?</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.062" offset="10755001">And the Court answered that question by looking at the common law of civil conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.309" offset="10771928">That mode of analysis would be appropriate here if the relevant predicate under 1961 were fraud or any conduct involving fraud or otherwise made reference to common-law fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.710" offset="10821561">But, of course, 1961 does not say that; it says</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.603" offset="10833159">"any act which is indictable under section 1341. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.038" offset="10846847">the mail fraud statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.504" offset="10852803">So under... given the structure of the statute, the only inquiry is: Is the injury incurred by reason of an act which is indictable under 1341?</text>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="2684.813" offset="10898047">But the RICO statute doesn't say you can recover if you're injured by reason of conspiracy, without any elaboration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.514" offset="10928767">It says</text>

            <text syncTime="2696.356" offset="10944127">And therefore you look to 1962(d), which tells you what the violation is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.010" offset="10966802">It's a RICO... it's a criminal RICO conspiracy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2717.269" offset="11027824">And so the Court in Beck explained that to figure out how you tell when someone has been injured by civil conspiracy, there is a body of law, the common law, that answers that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.326" offset="11084039">There is no corresponding common-law principle of what it means to be injured by an act of mail fraud because there is no common law of mail fraud per se; it's a statutory creation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.776" offset="11129806">And so the relevant inquiry is simply: Did the conduct violate the mail fraud statute, section 1341?</text>

            <text syncTime="2799.202" offset="11355504">And certainly the 1964, it does refer to the common-law requirements of proximate cause.</text>

            <text syncTime="2841.620" offset="11525195">Congress made clear, in the finding that accompanied the statute, that one of its principal concerns was that criminal enterprises could use illegal means to compete unfairly with legitimate businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.540" offset="11564901">And so if a business... a criminal business were to use threats of violence directed at its competitor's customers to get them to switch their business to it, the competitor would have a cause of action for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.488" offset="11612653">And then the same should be true, we submit, if the business uses fraud directed at its competitor's customers to induce them to switch their business.</text>

            <text syncTime="2881.980" offset="11686632">The difference between this case and what Congress intended is that, yes, in the comments to the enactment of RICO, Congress did say that it was trying to protect legitimate competitors from illegitimate conduct or unlawful conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.300" offset="11767925">This case has now morphed into a situation where competitors are using RICO as an anticompetitive device, and that's what we believe the reliance requirement will... will at least rein in, totally consistent with the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.949" offset="11830514">We are not asking this Court to impose any requirement on RICO that does not already exist by reason of the common-law meaning rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.008" offset="11874818">Actually, we believe our opponents and the S.G. are asking this Court to expand RICO by unmooring it from the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.693" offset="11909508">We believe that Beck versus Prubis is exactly the same situation and the same analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.797" offset="11937930">Although 1962(d), which is a substantive conspiracy violation of RICO, was at issue in Beck versus Prupis, you get to the same situation just as an extra step.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.510" offset="11996757">Here's the... here's the analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.119" offset="12007206">You look to 19... they have a conspiracy count of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.743" offset="12017760">But you look to 1962(c), and it says that</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.945" offset="12030508">"any person injured by reason of. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.881" offset="12042315">--if you read in 1964(c) to it... by reason of a RICO violation or a... or a racketeering activity</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.394" offset="12076274">"shall have a cause of action. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.831" offset="12086096">Now, you look to racketeering activity in 1961, and that has a hundred and something predicate acts, one of which is mail fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.626" offset="12117234">You look at mail fraud, and it says "a scheme to defraud".</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.952" offset="12130504">It uses the word "defraud".</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.558" offset="12136983">What does that mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.294" offset="12143879">It's the same place; you just... you just need to take one more step to get there, but it's the same place the Court found itself, we submit, in Beck versus Prupis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.243" offset="12179719">If criminal conspiracy means the same thing as civil conspiracy, Beck versus Prupis would not... the Court would not have held what it did in Beck versus Prupis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.083" offset="12219112">And if mail fraud only means an indictable offense and nothing more under the criminal law, it should be the same as the civil law, then there would be no common-law meaning rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="3037.309" offset="12307928">You're saying there are two requirements, and therefore, fraud here is just like conspiracy in Beck.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.162" offset="12339379">But in fact, mail fraud is... is a single term of art.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.755" offset="12361740">It refers simply to a criminal violation for which there... there is no exact civil counterpart.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.019" offset="12402805">And so, if you take mail fraud as being a unified term of art, then it seems to me that your argument falls apart, because you can't treat the fraud in the mail fraud the way you treated the conspiracy standing alone in Beck.</text>

            <text syncTime="3113.634" offset="12613247">The only reason we know what it means is because the Court has construed it over the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.867" offset="12634250">In order to construe it now in a civil context, we are asking the Court to apply the common law meaning rule because that's... the analog is fraud; that's the obvious source to look to the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.800" offset="12681897">If I may I'd like to make a few other points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.954" offset="12694540">First of all, I cannot leave this podium and leave this Court under the impression that there is directness of injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.266" offset="12723797">There are 195 bidders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.905" offset="12734351">The plaintiffs themselves alleged this in paragraph 46, our joint appendix 20 and 21.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.620" offset="12761205">Without belaboring it, the last few pages of our reply brief show all of the things that would have to be shown in order to have even... even a remote directness of injury in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.787" offset="12817943">So the... we have not... we have not in any way conceded that the requirements of Anza or Holmes have been met.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.207" offset="12851588">And... but I think our brief adequately deals with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.781" offset="12869874">I'd also like to point out that RICO and mail fraud don't reach everything actionable at common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.044" offset="12902893">I mean, if there was an argument, that would mean that civil RICO in every case involving a false statement... every case involving a false statement, no matter to whom it's made, would be a civil RICO case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.007" offset="12950749">The general idea of protecting competitors doesn't mean that Congress provided that anything that anyone says to anybody violates civil RICO.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.112" offset="12991187">That's not the way that this Court interprets statutes; and there is no allegation in the complaint at all as... that the rotational basis applies only when bids are at zero percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.901" offset="13038312">In the year 2000 the Illinois Supreme Court confronted the same plaintiff in this case, Phoenix Bond, challenging a very similar rule because at that point in time there was collusion including the same plaintiff to keep the penalty rate at 18 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.989" offset="13098707">And the Illinois Supreme Court said the rule will... is something that the treasurer has the right to make to try to regulate the bids, and the treasurer certainly can be a victim of this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.669" offset="13149384">If the bid is not perceived as fair, the treasurer will not have enough bidders in order to sell all the bids, and therefore, the county will not be paid the unpaid taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.510" offset="13192748">If the treasurer thought that there really was a misrepresentation here made by the Petitioners, the treasurer would have a very great incentive and a very great state in enforcing this rule; and the treasurer did not, we believe because the treasurer doesn't believe there is any violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.187" offset="13263487">The... the other ways that the county could be injured are that if the... if the penalty rate goes up beyond zero percent, there is no guarantee that the same number of bidders will... will come to the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.261" offset="13335794">There... I also want to refer the Court to other... this is not new.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.006" offset="13366723">In Safeco Insurance just recently, last term, the Court asked... was asked to define the term "willfulness" in a civil liability provision of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and the Court observed that there is different meanings in the civil and criminal law to the term "willfulness".</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.655" offset="13437358">In Farmer versus Brennan the Court recognized different uses of the term "recklessness" in the civil and criminal contexts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.277" offset="13467869">So once again we are asking this Court to rule consistent with the common law meaning rule that the... a civil RICO action predicated on mail fraud, where one is... it has to fulfill the requirement that you have been... the plaintiff has been injured by reason of mail fraud or racketeering activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.908" offset="13558357">The plaintiff must rely on a misrepresentation or the fraud directly, because that's the essence of civil fraud.</text>
