            <text syncTime="15.448" offset="229132">Everyone agrees that under the reasonable factor other than age provision of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, a business practice that is reasonable is not unlawful even if it has a disparate impact on older workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.942" offset="275108">The question here is simply what happens in cases in which the proof on reasonableness is in equipoise, which party bears the risk of nonpersuasion.</text>

            <text syncTime="85.997" offset="511359">So the standards are, in fact, quite different.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.887" offset="522853">The reasonable factor other than age provision looks at the reasonableness of the actual, existing practice, and that's where the "because of age" refers to the business practice there.</text>

            <text syncTime="151.049" offset="771539">Mr. Russell, this is the problem that I have with your double inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.266" offset="784391">First, you decide business necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.360" offset="792750">Then you decide reasonable factor other than age.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.732" offset="810305">Once you determine that there is no business necessity, there is a readily available alternative, so what you're left with is a pretext for age discrimination, what... what function is there for anything else to perform?</text>
            <text syncTime="183.738" offset="902256">I mean, I understand the business necessity, whether you have it pre-1991 or post, but I don't understand putting this other test on top of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.452" offset="953142">It sounds like you're making it harder for the... for the plaintiff.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kevin_k_russell" startTime="204.401" stopTime="283.183">
            <label>Mr. Kevin K. Russell</label>
            <text syncTime="204.401" offset="984907">Well, we think that the layering of the tests arises out of the structure of the statute as Congress wrote it.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.476" offset="1009253">If this Court disagrees with us, however, and thinks that there is room in the statutory language to treat the language of 4(a)(2) differently in some sense or to apply a different Wards Cove test, then you're still left with the question of who bears the burden of reasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.738" offset="1066305">And on that grounds we agree entirely with the EEOC that that question is still determined by the language of the statute, which makes quite clear that Congress thought that this was an exception to liability upon which the employer bears the burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.201" offset="1116146">And it made that... made that clear both by setting the RFOA up as an exception to liability, which this Court has long told Congress will be construed as establishing an affirmative defense absent strong indications of contrary legislative intent, and by sandwiching that defense in the same sentence as two other affirmative defenses, which would be a very strange thing to do if Congress in fact intended the courts to figure out, you know, one of the three is not like the others, That it's intended, instead, as a modification of the definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.033" offset="1231503">And, third, Congress I think it... it does, and it is telling that, in defining the unlawful employment practice, that is in defining the plaintiff's case in chief, Congress used the same language that it did in Title VII, and this Court has never construed that language to require proof of unreasonableness.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="283.183" stopTime="300.379">
            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="283.183" offset="1300048">Well, your friend, of course, makes the point that the age discrimination prohibition is narrower in scope than Title VII, that there are more likely to be instances in which a reasonable factor other than age came into play than there would be a basis for discrimination on the basis of race.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kevin_k_russell" startTime="300.379" stopTime="349.438">
            <label>Mr. Kevin K. Russell</label>
            <text syncTime="300.379" offset="1368803">We acknowledge that.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.410" offset="1372982">This Court pointed out in Smith that Congress itself recognized that there was a difference between age and other kinds of discrimination; but it took that difference into account not by defining the unlawful employment practice differently, but by providing age discrimination defendants a capacious defense that's not available to any other defendant in a Federal employment discrimination statute, and by in 1991 not extending the modifications to Wards Cove to ADEA plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.477" offset="1485204">Congress already specifically addressed this question of whether Wards Cove should be adjusted in order to make age discrimination claims harder to prove than Title VII claims, and it agreed that it should; but it didn't do it in the way that Respondents suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.096" offset="1539748">Instead they lowered the bar for Title VII plaintiffs and left in place the Wards Cove test for age discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="349.438" offset="1565035">Isn't it a strain to say that an employment practice was because of an individual's age, but at the same time was based on reasonable factors other than age?</text>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="360.122" offset="1607771">Doesn't the latter negate the former or come very close to negating the former?</text>
            <text syncTime="365.119" offset="1627833">And if that's the case doesn't that suggest that it's not really an affirmative defense but what's necessary to show liability?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kevin_k_russell" startTime="371.820" stopTime="524.805">
            <label>Mr. Kevin K. Russell</label>
            <text syncTime="371.820" offset="1654582">--I don't think it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.943" offset="1663150">We use the example in our brief of a weight-lifting requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.708" offset="1674122">It's quite possible for that requirement, and quite likely, that it will have a disparate impact on older workers because of their age.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.550" offset="1701498">The effect will be felt by workers because of their age.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.376" offset="1712783">At the same time, it is quite possible that that practice itself will be entirely reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.280" offset="1732427">And the difference is between what the "because of age" refers to in the two different provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.497" offset="1757296">So if you look on page 3 of the blue brief, you have the language of the RFOA provision, and the reasonable... the "factors other than age" refers to in that case the differentiation, that is the business practice itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.851" offset="1806719">But if you turn to the prior page on page 1A and look at the language of (a)(2), the business practice, that is, the limiting, segregating, or classifying, doesn't have to be because of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.956" offset="1847157">There wouldn't be a disparate treatment claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.081" offset="1855621">Instead what "because of age" refers to there is the effect of that facially neutral practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.876" offset="1874847">That is, the employee has to show that the neutral practice deprives or tends to deprive people of opportunities because of their age.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.044" offset="1907552">And the way that you do that is through the first step of the Wards Cove analysis, by showing that the practice falls more heavily on older workers as a group, so that you can reach the conclusion that the plaintiff is feeling the effect because of her age as opposed to because of her sex or some other reason specific to her.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.740" offset="1970246">So it's not the fact that a showing of RFOA negates the showing that a disparate impact is felt because of age by the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.189" offset="2012042">As we were... as I was mentioning before, the language of the statute we think strongly points in favor of an ordinary reading of this as an affirmative defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.373" offset="2048822">The Respondent's principal objection is that this doesn't give adequate weight to the differences between age and other forms of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.090" offset="2079647">But as I mentioned, we... we do think that Congress took that into account in a different way, and there is, we think, quite an important value here in providing Congress clear rules of interpretation so that it knows when it enacts statutes using a particular formulation the courts will construe it in an ordinary way, absent some compelling indication to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.549" offset="2165537">We recognize, of course, in Betts that this Court found such a compelling counter-indication in the legislative history of that statute, and in the... the law's traditional treatment of benefits... retirement benefits and seniority rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.730" offset="2226246">But Respondents can't point to any kind of similar showing in this case that Congress would have intended this catch-all provision to mean something other than what it seems to say.</text>

            <text syncTime="541.422" offset="2333035">And my impression is that that formulation in this Equal Pay Act has been rather problematic.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.028" offset="2371487">First, you have to find there is a differential between the pay of men and the pay of women, so... and then you go to any other factor other than sex.</text>

            <text syncTime="571.457" offset="2453198">Well, certainly what you have to show before you get to the defense is different in the two statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.658" offset="2473991">They are similar in the sense that neither requires proof of intentional discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.015" offset="2495412">For example, in Corning Glass Works all the plaintiffs showed there was that a facially neutral practice, that is paying the night shift folks more than the day shift folks, resulted in women getting paid less than men for the same work, and that was sufficient to shift the burden over to the employer to show that it was based on any other factor other than age.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.540" offset="2573466">And in here we think that it's similar, that the plaintiff has to show that a neutral employment practice has a disparate impact on the basis of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.972" offset="2611186">We think in our view, in addition, the plaintiff has to make the full Wards Cove showing that would be sufficient in Title VII to establish liability conclusively.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.062" offset="2647549">And at that point, then the burden does shift to the employer but it's a modest burden.</text>

            <text syncTime="970.940" offset="4051056">And Congress made very clear in the statute that the "reasonable factors other than age" provision is precisely such an affirmative defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.014" offset="4079372">It did so first by saying that the provision applies to activities that are "otherwise prohibited by subsection A".</text>
            <text syncTime="985.121" offset="4107794">That has to mean that liability for disparate impacts exists under subsection A without regard to whether the employment practice is based on reasonable factors other than age.</text>

            <text syncTime="1568.888" offset="6442827">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I want to make an argument both from elegance and from function and from structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.071" offset="6479608">Under the employment discrimination... a wide range of employment discrimination, beginning with this Court's decision in McDonnell Douglas, this Court has applied a three-step balance-shifting paradigm in order to help juries resolve the question of whether discrimination occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.361" offset="6556721">In the disparate treatment cases there is a burden... the first step, the plaintiff has to establish a prima facie case that he was the subject of disparate treatment because of his race or sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.246" offset="6608339">The burden of production then shifts to the defendant in order to explain, under disparate treatment cases, a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason, which eliminates the presumption consistent with Evidence Rule 301, and the burden of proof then resumes on the plaintiff to prove discrimination because of the prohibited characteristic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.471" offset="6709172">Now, in Wards Cove, this Court looked both to Rule 301 and to the paradigm in other discrimination cases to apply a three-part test, in which there is a burden of proof to establish a presumption, a burden of production to neutralize it, and then a burden of proof to show because of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.212" offset="6800182">The Second Circuit has done exactly that in this case, and we think they are right not just because that harmonizes this Court's prior discrimination cases, and not just because three seems to be more elegant than the four steps that the Petitioners want or the two steps that the Government wants, but because it makes sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.717" offset="6902164">And this goes directly to the question, I think it was, that Justice Alito asked: Whether or not the "reasonable factors other than age" inquiry is simply what's necessary to show liability, that is, that it was because of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.491" offset="6969247">The ADEA doesn't prohibit disparate treatment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1775.211" offset="7268192">This Court resolved that question in Smith, and it resolved it in large part by reference to the "reasonable factors other than age" provision, which Justice Stevens' opinion for a plurality of the Court explained that, when you have a disparate treatment case, if the plaintiff proves that his... his or her treatment... if the defendant proves that it was because of something other than age, it isn't disparate treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.590" offset="7381668">The fact that there is an RFOA provision, we think, does reflect the fact that there is the potential for liability under disparate impact, but as this Court explained, it's narrower.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.162" offset="7436003">And it's narrower because... not only because the 1991 amendments didn't apply to age cases; it's narrower, because as this Court has recognized in almost every age case it has decided, age... unlike race and sex and religion and national origin... often does... sad to say by somebody who is in his second decade of protection under the ADEA... often does correlate with reasonable employment factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.071" offset="7575601">And the fact that all... what it means is that at step one of the burden-shifting analysis, the Wards Cove analysis, which in a race or sex case establishes a strong presumption that the employment action was because of race or sex because there are so few employment characteristics that do correlate negatively with one's race or one's gender, it's a strong presumption which nonetheless need be met only by a burden of production.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.149" offset="7719901">This Court has recognized that in the age context, the presumption actually is quite weak.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.131" offset="7747800">And it would be more than perverse to adopt the Government's proposal, which is that notwithstanding the much weaker inference, the burden of persuasion is now on the employer, not the employee.</text>

            <text syncTime="2556.317" offset="10392646">But this case shows that it means everything because at step three of Wards Cove the petitioner... the plaintiff's burden is proving that it is... that there is one other way... that all you have to show is that it wasn't a necessity to do it that way in order to achieve your objective and the employee wins.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.340" offset="10488672">But because of the differential in correlation between age and employment factors, in this case it is a business justification; that is, the employee has to come in and say it just wasn't reasonable to use that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.582" offset="10557635">And this case is a perfect example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.487" offset="10569234">Here we have a research lab that has one client.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.501" offset="10585325">It's the nuclear reactor division of the United States submarine unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.640" offset="10601939">And they come, and they say... and there is no dispute about the facts here... they say the Cold War is over.</text>

            <text syncTime="2619.354" offset="10644780">And since you're cost-plus, you're going to have to reduce your work force; and because we are in a different kind of war, we have new missions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.960" offset="10679157">You are going to have to design and engineer and implement things that you hadn't done it before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.207" offset="10704130">And so you need to figure out a way to go ahead and do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.816" offset="10718550">And what the company did was to go through all of its units and then subunits and sections, and say: Given the new mission that the Navy has told us we are going to have to occupy, do you have people... do you have more people than you're going to get paid for to do what you have to do?</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.934" offset="10795036">If the answer is yes... if the answer is no, you're fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.666" offset="10809978">If the answer is yes, please consider the following: What are the skills within the people within your section, subsection, or unit that are excess, that in light of the reduced and changed mission we don't need?</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.974" offset="10863268">Identify those skills.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.909" offset="10871000">Then go through each one of your employees; and if it is an employee with that skill, rank them on a scale of 1 to 10 according to four different characteristics: Seniority, which gives a benefit to older workers; recent job-performance ratings; the criticality of the other skills they have, do they have some other skill that is going to be required; and their flexibility... how willing have they been, or are they, to learn new skills?</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.679" offset="10986043">And the company has a training manual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.257" offset="10996388">It goes through and trains the managers to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.975" offset="11007255">It is approved by the Department of Energy and the Department of the Navy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.613" offset="11021779">But after the managers engage in this analysis and prepare this matrix, they then have to justify it before a central review board, which the plaintiff's own expert acknowledged was set up in order to make the managers defend each decision and make sure that those judgments corresponded with overall management's responsibilities.</text>

            <text syncTime="2858.664" offset="11602011">The point is that this Court in Smith and earlier in Hazen Paper and earlier age cases was highly cognizant of the fact that unless there is a test that implies that... that applies certainty for employers, there is going to be... age... if this standard isn't reasonable and if it isn't up to the other side to prove that it's unreasonable, employers are essentially going to take age into account.</text>

            <text syncTime="2946.849" offset="11954768">Now, the district court... the trial court who heard the testimony said that he... he deemed flexibility and criticality objective.</text>

            <text syncTime="3379.175" offset="13684075">I'd like to begin by addressing the general legal question that the Court granted cert on, and particularly going back to this idea, this assertion that the proof of the RFOA is somehow a negation of the obligation that the plaintiff has to prove that they have suffered a disparate impact because of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.040" offset="13771532">It is simply incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.290" offset="13776443">It's based... as, Justice Souter, I think you were suggesting in some of your questions... on a confusion about what the 4(a)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.988" offset="13819284">The requirement under Section 4(a)(2) is simply to show that the effect of the practice is felt because of age, while the defense in the RFOA provision is to show that the practice itself is reasonable even though it has this effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="3429.496" offset="13885322">Well, the practice... if a practice correlates with a number of... statistically correlates with a number of different factors, is it because of all of those factors?</text>

            <text syncTime="3439.525" offset="13925446">I think, under Wards Cove, this Court has said that it does, and so under Wards Cove you establish that the discrimination is felt by older workers because of age by showing that all the workers as a group suffer disproportionately from it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3462.688" offset="14018128">--But I think all you have to show under 4(a)(2) is that the practice tends to disadvantage older workers because of their age.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.575" offset="14045609">And so again in our weight... weight example, the employer admits in our weight example that the effect of the neutral practice is to fall more heavily, is to restrict the employment opportunities of older workers because of age, but says, even if that's true... even if there is a disparate impact because of age... we are still entitled to the defense because the practice itself is reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.160" offset="14127947">It's also... I would like to address the suggestion that Griggs is directed... or disparate impact is directed at ferreting out intentional discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.781" offset="14170475">Certainly it serves that function in many cases, but that's not the sole purpose of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.358" offset="14188760">And it's simply not the purpose of the prima facie case in Wards Cove to give rise to an inference of intentional discrimination, and the fact that it doesn't as strongly in the age case I think isn't a reason to think that Congress intended the courts to develop a different test for showing what's otherwise prohibited under 4(a)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.257" offset="14256365">And, finally, if I could address some of the questions regarding what happened in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.348" offset="14280711">This case, Justice Stevens, was not tried with reasonableness in mind, both because Respondents abandoned their "reasonable factor other than age" defense, which they had raised as an affirmative defense in their answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.670" offset="14334001">I believe Mr. Waxman is incorrect when he suggests that they in fact asked for instructions.</text>
