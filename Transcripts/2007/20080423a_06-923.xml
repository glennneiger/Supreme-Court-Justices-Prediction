            <text syncTime="9.356" offset="205959">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: For two reasons, the Sixth Circuit was wrong to hold that a company that is an ERISA claim fiduciary and that separately funds the plan's liabilities must always be deemed to be operating under a conflict of interest that changes the employer's designated arbitrary and capricious standard of review under its plan document.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.971" offset="304389">And the first reason is one that we're on common ground with and that is, as this Court recognized in Pegram v. Herdrich, ERISA explicitly authorizes companies like Metlife to fulfill both fiduciary and nonfiduciary functions as long as it does not in actuality commingle those functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.837" offset="403863">The mere fact that the potentiality of conflict is inherent in all of these commonplace dual arrangements in ERISA welfare benefit plans is not enough on its own to displace the employer's designated abuse of discretion standard of review.</text>

            <text syncTime="80.833" offset="491843">No, but neither, neither does the fact that there may be dual capacities eliminate the fact that there are contrary tugs on the, the individual or the, or the organization that has the dual responsibilities, and there's no reason that the law should be blind to that.</text>

            <text syncTime="102.780" offset="579615">And as Firestone recognized, though, if in fact there is a, an entity that is in actuality conflicted, a claim administrator, then that conflict doesn't change the standard of review.</text>

            <text syncTime="182.329" offset="897786">Let me follow up on Justice Scalia's question because I think your brief really goes astray on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.316" offset="925790">Think of the many situations like the remainderman who is the trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.054" offset="948673">He has to look out for the interests of the live tenant, but he's going to keep all the rest, so maybe he wants to be economical.</text>

            <text syncTime="219.502" offset="1046475">And I think that if you would keep that separation in mind, is there a conflicting interest?</text>
            <text syncTime="230.560" offset="1090779">Yes, there is.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.593" offset="1094854">Has the trustee in fact slipped and taken unfair advantage because of the conflicting interests?</text>

            <text syncTime="3698.722" offset="14963367">On question one, I think it's important to know that the zone of reasonableness and the size of the field is set forth by the employer when it designates discretionary authority and says that the standard of review is an arbitrary and capricious one in court, which is the same in ERISA as an abuse-of-discretion standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3720.070" offset="15048735">And the... and the fact that's common and known to the employer in setting forth that standard, that there is this dual role, shouldn't change that analysis at all, nor should it come into play in any significant way whatsoever in these decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3737.181" offset="15117176">But on question two, if there is a conflict that influence, that's not what the employer was anticipating.</text>
            <text syncTime="3745.120" offset="15148941">And so it... it changes the size of the permissible field.</text>
            <text syncTime="3750.505" offset="15170570">And to get to Justice Scalia's point, the actual conflict there does matter because it changes the size of the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="3758.928" offset="15204216">It's not what the employer was intending in its plan.</text>
