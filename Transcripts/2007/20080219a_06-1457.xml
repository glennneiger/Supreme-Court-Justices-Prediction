            <text syncTime="28.583" offset="280091">Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in this case reasonably denied Respondent's request to modify the wholesale contracts that the purchasing power companies had entered into in 2000 and 2001.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.629" offset="352293">The Commission reasonably concluded that Respondents had not made the requisite showing under the Federal Power Act and under this Court's decisions in Mobile and Sierra that modification of the contracts was necessary in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.639" offset="408300">In reaching that conclusion, FERC first drew on three factors that this Court had identified in Sierra and found that they were not satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.660" offset="444349">Thus, it found that Respondents had failed to show that the contracts would impose financial strain on the purchasing companies; that it would impose excessive burdens on the customers; or that they were unduly discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.504" offset="499728">But FERC also looked--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="84.154" offset="502341">But FERC thought it could live with the Ninth Circuit's decision, because the government recommended that we deny cert in this case; isn't that so?</text>

            <text syncTime="94.462" offset="543614">--That is... that is correct, and FERC thought that perhaps the decision could be limited to the circumstances arising out of the California energy crisis in the years 2000 to 2001, and that it could channel its concerns about contract stability through those other factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.873" offset="625221">But, nonetheless, FERC believes, as its decisions make clear and as our position in this Court makes clear, that the Ninth Circuit's reformulation of the Mobile-Sierra doctrine or interpretation of the act was incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.515" offset="683735">And, now that the Court has granted review, we urge affirmance of FERC's decision in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="136.972" offset="713619">Wasn't it clear to the government that the Ninth Circuit, which is what, about 10 percent of the country, was going to continue this interpretation of the act, and that was not a matter of any consequence to FERC or to the government?</text>

            <text syncTime="150.714" offset="768581">It was of consequence, but FERC still believed it had some interpretive authority after the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.452" offset="795539">Maybe this was a wrong judgment at the time, but FERC thought that it still had some interpretive authority under the decision, and that it could--</text>

            <text syncTime="165.222" offset="826572">But, Mr. Kneedler, this is a decision, the Ninth Circuit decision, that empowers FERC.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.524" offset="847784">FERC says: Oh, we don't have that authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.078" offset="861995">And the Ninth Circuit said: Yes, you do.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.744" offset="872652">So this is an agency arguing that it can't do what the Ninth Circuit says it can.</text>

            <text syncTime="189.853" offset="925106">Because of two decisions of this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="214.069" offset="1021968">I mean it, I think... I took the question to be that it might give FERC broader flexibility, but at a very substantial cost to the stability of contracts, which was the underlying point that this Court stressed in its decision in Sierra: That the Federal Power Act, unlike... and the Natural Gas Act, unlike the Interstate Commerce Act, contemplates that rates will be set by contract, or at least can be set by contract; and that therefore, like in most situations, a party to a contract cannot unilaterally walk away from that contract or insist upon its modification because it may become disadvantageous over time.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="250.476" offset="1167627">I thought... let's go back a step.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.828" offset="1173061">I thought FERC's position was: We could not decide as a matter of discretion to do this because we are limited by those Supreme Court decisions.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="262.000" offset="1213707">So it's not what FERC... FERC independently interpreting the statute to reach the conclusion, which it might, to reach the conclusion the Ninth Circuit did.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.288" offset="1254876">It's FERC saying: We can't do that because we have our marching orders from the Supreme Court.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="277.925" offset="1277446">--No.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.609" offset="1280163">I think... I mean there are... there are two interpretive questions here: When does the public interest standard identified in this Court's decisions in Mobile and Sierra apply?</text>
            <text syncTime="290.483" offset="1327706">And then there is the further question of what is necessary to satisfy the public interest standard for modifying a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.089" offset="1358112">We think on both points the Commission's decision in this case reflects an interpretive judgment that the Court's decision, or the interpretation reflected in the Court's decision, in Sierra applies equally in the market based rate system without any of the... either of the two prerequisites that the Ninth Circuit formulated as a precondition to applying the public interest standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.471" offset="1459572">And I would point the Court's attention, in the joint appendix in the Commission's decision, to joint appendix 1244 and 1245, repeated again at 1572 and 1573; and also the passage quoted in the Morgan Stanley brief at page 17, reflects a determination of what the Commission's longstanding policy has been that, contracts once entered into, their integrity must be protected and should not be lightly set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.158" offset="1574406">And also, the Commission specifically rejected at pages 1564 and 1565 of the joint appendix the prerequisites that the Ninth Circuit came up with in this case, that there must be an opportunity to determine whether the rates were within a zone of just and reasonableness at the time the contracts were entered into in order for Mobile and Sierra to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.423" offset="1663431">Under a market based rate system, what FERC does is determine at the outset when an applicant applies for a market based tariff whether that company has market power and if so, whether it's mitigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.731" offset="1716617">Only in those circumstances is the company granted the authority to market... to set prices by the market.</text>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="395.169" offset="1746396">What happens if that approval is given and then a seller enters into contracts and then it's later discovered that, contrary to what FERC thought when it granted the approval, the seller has exercised market power or has otherwise manipulated the market?</text>
            <text syncTime="414.148" offset="1822360">Is there any remedy in that situation?</text>

            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="416.600" offset="1832078">Well, what the Commission determined in this case is that there was... there was no manipulation or exercise of market power identified with respect to these specific contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.789" offset="1872933">And what the Commission decided was that the importance of the integrity of contracts in that circumstance required that the contract be maintained.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.977" offset="1909609">If the Respondents had shown bad faith or something like that in the connection... or fraud in connection with the formation of these particular contracts, that would have been quite a different matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.952" offset="1949524">It's also important to note that the Commission found in this case that there was no dysfunction in the forward market, which is what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.041" offset="1981916">What was going on is that there was dysfunction in the spot market in 2000, 2001 for a variety of reasons, some of them going to market fundamentals such as a shortage of generation capacity, a shortage of hydropower.</text>

            <label>Mr. Walter E. Dellinger, III</label>
            <text syncTime="821.294" offset="3450938">Justice Stevens, good morning, and may it please the Court: Justice Ginsburg began by asking whether the Ninth Circuit decision did not in fact empower rather than restrict the authority of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.185" offset="3498481">The answer is that the Ninth Circuit decision fundamentally precludes the Commission from carrying out what the Commission believes is essential to its mandate to assure an abundancy of electrical energy at the lowest possible cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.211" offset="3562533">And that is to encourage a market based approach to recognize that if you're going to have, as the Commission has said, the kind of investment in the building of infrastructure to produce energy, people are going to have to be able to rely upon long term contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.939" offset="3641528">In this case, what the Ninth Circuit's decision did is to take away a very important option that the Commission believes is essential in times of market volatility and dysfunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.116" offset="3702236">And that is the option for parties to get out of the spot market and to enter into a long term contract of a secure supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.404" offset="3735359">If the Ninth Circuit's decision stood, literally parties, buyers and sellers, would both be precluded from entering into that, because you would know if there were dysfunction that nothing you could say in the contract could mean that you could buy power for the next eight years at $105 at a time, as was the case here, when the spot market was $300.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.522" offset="3839849">It would take away the option.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.141" offset="3846328">And sellers would know they couldn't enter into a contract they could rely upon subject only to being overridden in the public interest, which FERC does.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.763" offset="3888750">And that would be very damaging to the very processes which the Commission has used consistent with this Court's decision of 50 years ago to encourage development in this industry.</text>

            <text syncTime="975.125" offset="4066279">And that runs through those two 1956 decisions, at a time when there was no market based authority, or any such, right?</text>

            <text syncTime="987.066" offset="4114030">That was a case where a seller was seeking to get out of a contract that was paying too low.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.856" offset="4141198">But the fundamental purpose... the Court recognized even in Justice Harlan's opinion that maintaining the stability and expectation of contracts was going to be important to consumers, to buyers as well as to sellers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.631" offset="4208280">In this... and FERC has adopted that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.833" offset="4221028">In this case you have a situation where the Commission decided that instability in the spot markets was being partly caused by the fact that the State regulatory process had discouraged people from entering into longer term contracts; and FERC said in its 2000 San Diego order, we strongly urge utilities to move their load to long term contracts of two years or more.</text>

            <text syncTime="1130.310" offset="4686948">That would mean that a seller would say to a buyer, we know you would like to get out of this volatility and get a regular supply guaranteed at a... at a much lower price for long term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.618" offset="4732192">We can't enter into that contract, because the fact that we know there has been this problem in the market means that our contract won't be upheld.</text>

            <text syncTime="1244.167" offset="5142419">Because whenever you were to modify the terms of a contract that the sellers have been relying upon, the sellers became buyers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1254.239" offset="5182648">So unraveling all of these buying and selling would itself be... would be dysfunctional; but what sellers would know thereafter is that they couldn't rely upon the contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.783" offset="5236878">They would either have to stay out of that market or they would have to charge a risk premium, which would raise prices to buyers and consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.203" offset="5266553">So that long run harm of making it less reliable to engage in contracting would have to be overcome by a fairly severe showing of what the short term harms would be to one particular set of buyers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1624.732" offset="6664626">First, in... in approving the market based rate program, Judge Douglas Ginsburg said when there is a competitive market, FERC may rely upon market based rates in lieu of cost of service regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.875" offset="6725230">That makes perfect sense to us, but when there is a competitive market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.596" offset="6752084">So we think a critical part of a market based rate program is that there must be an inquiry into whether or not the market was competitive when the contract was entered into.</text>
