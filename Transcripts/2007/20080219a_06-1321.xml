            <text syncTime="38.375" offset="324951">This scheme is inconsistent with over three decades of administrative interpretations by the agencies charged with administering and enforcing the statute and it is flatly inconsistent, most importantly, with the plain language and historical origins of the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.135" offset="383987">By its plain terms, Section 633a(a) bars retaliation against covered workers who have complained that have they suffered age discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="104.833" offset="590773">First of all discrimination... retaliatory conduct aimed at a 40-year-old or someone over age 40 because he or she is asserting rights she possesses by virtue of being age 40 or older is discrimination based on age.</text>

            <text syncTime="117.075" offset="639674">I mean, a company could have a policy of firing everybody who complains about anything and the fact that a worker is over the age of 40 and is fired does not mean that he is being fired because of age.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph R. Guerra</label>
            <text syncTime="129.733" offset="690351">Mr. Chief Justice, the issue in this case is whether plaintiff is entitled to allege and ultimately prove that she was... she suffered adverse personnel actions because she complained of age discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.791" offset="734551">It may be that in some, that in a certain case the employer could demonstrate that in fact the retaliatory conduct was not triggered by the nature of the complaint, and in fact there have been Title VII cases where the courts have found that it was the manner in which a complaint was lodged, that there was, that there was false statements or it was too inflammatory, and so the employer prevailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.537" offset="817515">But if... the issue here is whether, if Ms. Gomez can prove ultimately that the retaliatory conduct was a function of the fact that as a 40-year-old she was asserting her rights to be free from age discrimination, we submit that is covered by the plain language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.647" offset="878015">And that is confirmed by this court's interpretation of Title IX in the Jackson case because there the Court--</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="182.201" offset="900167">Of course the statute that covers age discrimination in the private sector does have an express provision addressing retaliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.955" offset="931200">The one that governs Federal employees does not, and that's the government's main argument, that it's expressed in the private sector, it's not there in the public sector and so you shouldn't imply one.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.694" offset="970175">What's your answer to that?</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph R. Guerra</label>
            <text syncTime="201.062" offset="975608">--Mr. Chief Justice, three responses to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.864" offset="986893">First of you, as this Court explained in Jackson itself, it's improper to narrow the scope of a stand alone general discrimination ban that does not identify any discriminatory practices based on a comparison with an enumeration ban that sets forth a detailed series of prohibitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.493" offset="1053349">And that's precisely the comparison that the Court rejected in Jackson and the government is asking the court to draw here.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="225.745" stopTime="231.413">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="225.745" offset="1074351">But in Jackson it was in a different statute and here it's in the same statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.630" offset="1089920">Surely that makes a big difference.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joseph_r_guerra" startTime="231.413" stopTime="252.093">
            <label>Mr. Joseph R. Guerra</label>
            <text syncTime="231.413" offset="1097026">It doesn't in this case, Justice Scalia, for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.815" offset="1106639">First of all, subsection (f) of section 633a effectively deems the private sector and the Federal sector provisions of the Age Act to be the functional equivalents of two separate statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.491" offset="1157316">So I think that distinction is refuted by that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.360" offset="1168810">But more fundamentally, the government's argument--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="252.093" stopTime="255.830">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="252.093" offset="1179782">I'm not familiar with that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.495" offset="1189395">What does that provision say?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joseph_r_guerra" startTime="255.830" stopTime="285.617">
            <label>Mr. Joseph R. Guerra</label>
            <text syncTime="255.830" offset="1194724">--That is the provision that the government cites in its brief and it provides that:</text>
            <text syncTime="266.836" offset="1238714">"Any personnel action of any department, agency, or other entity referred to in subsection (a) of this section shall not be subject to or affected by any provision of this chapter other than the provisions of Section 631b of this title. "</text>
            <text syncTime="278.678" offset="1286152">And the government's position is that that provision makes these statutory schemes utterly distinct from one another.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="285.617" stopTime="323.675">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="285.617" offset="1313842">Well, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.067" offset="1319693">I mean, they're all in the same, in the same statute, and what that provision says is that just because we give certain relief in, in the portion applicable to private discrimination, does not mean that we give that relief in the section applicable to government discrimination, where it is explicitly withheld... it can't be explicitly withheld... where it is withheld, although it's explicitly included for private discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.469" offset="1429303">I think that's the only sensible way to read that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.838" offset="1442782">It surely doesn't make two statutes out of, out of one.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.873" offset="1458874">It is simply one statute.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joseph_r_guerra" startTime="323.675" stopTime="359.848">
            <label>Mr. Joseph R. Guerra</label>
            <text syncTime="323.675" offset="1466084">Justice Scalia, if I may, two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.194" offset="1476219">One is it's clear that the scope of the language of 633a(a) is broader in its own right than 623a, which is the... or 623a and 623b operate in conjunction with each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.502" offset="1525434">So we know that the stand alone prohibition in the Federal sector side is intended to be broader than the... the discrimination ban of 623(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="349.573" offset="1569737">So it's not anomalous at all to conclude that because it sweeps more broadly and because it's not limited by any other provision that operates in conjunction with it, that there's no basis for drawing a negative inference.</text>

          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="359.848" stopTime="394.935">
            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="359.848" offset="1610802">Well, why would Congress have taken this drafting approach?</text>
            <text syncTime="362.448" offset="1621146">The private sector provisions were already in existence when it made the statute applicable to Federal workers and there was a specific provision prohibiting retaliation in the private sector.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.124" offset="1675899">If Congress wanted to carry that over to the Federal sector, why wouldn't they have either copied that or incorporated it?</text>
            <text syncTime="383.345" offset="1704738">And they did neither, and in fact they enacted a provision that says that the private sector provisions are not incorporated unless they're specifically noted.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.752" offset="1742459">And this isn't one of the ones that's noted.</text>

            <text syncTime="394.935" offset="1751132">Justice Alito, if I could... the second point I was going to address to Justice Scalia I think answers this, this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.673" offset="1774119">Congress did the exact same thing in Title VII two years earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.127" offset="1787912">It could have added Federal employers to the definition of employer and subjected them to the private sector regime there, but instead it created a stand alone prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.797" offset="1822603">If you take the government's logic in this case and apply it to Title VII, it would lead to the conclusion that the Federal sector ban in Title VII, which is 717(a), does not bar retaliation either, and yet we know that's not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.691" offset="1874116">Because--</text>

            <text syncTime="429.708" offset="1890208">--You... that's correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.377" offset="1896895">It's not true because of this Court's holdings, but it's true because of the structure of the statute, the consistent interpretations of the lower courts and the administrative agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.800" offset="1930645">The structure of the statute is, in 717(a), the language, the prohibition there is virtually identical to the prohibition here except it proscribes race discrimination, et cetera, instead of age discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.541" offset="1981532">Then, in the remedy section Congress explicitly made a remedy for retaliation available for violations of 717(a)'s substantive norm.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.814" offset="2014655">The only reason to do that was because Congress understood that substantive norm to prohibit retaliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.282" offset="2032523">Congress then copied that very same language into 633a(a), thereby giving it the same breadth.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.004" offset="2067422">And so the negative inference theory the government puts forward with respect to Title VII fails on that statute because of the incorporation of the remedies, we know that that prohibition bars retaliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.879" offset="2110890">And because the norm at issue here was copied from that Federal sector prohibition in Title VII, the same reasoning dictates that the argument fail here as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="512.361" offset="2220813">In other words, despite all the remedies under the CSRA that says in some cases you go here, in other cases you go here, and you get different types of review depending on the facts, all of that would be wiped away if you can bring a direct action under the age discrimination statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1643.944" offset="6747207">The government's position is that statutory context matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.312" offset="6760686">It made that clear in footnote 1 of its Jackson brief before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.398" offset="6776986">It's made it clear in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.800" offset="6782629">In this case, there are several indicia of statutory intent that are lacking where you have a general prohibition in the context of the inferred right that has... that this Court has treated differently, as it did in Jackson and as it should in the did in the CBOCS case that you'll hear about tomorrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.824" offset="6838740">In the Age Discrimination Act you have separate provisions of the Act which explicitly delineate different types of discrimination, including retaliatory discrimination, and in the Federal sector prohibition the Congress added in 1974, it added that at a time where it decided to treat State employers like Federal employers, specifically put the State employers in the definition of employer for the Federal... for the private sector provision of the Age Discrimination Act, and it created a stand alone provision for Federal employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.329" offset="6960679">And then it went even further.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.695" offset="6966217">It specifically said in subsection (f) of section 633a, the Federal sector provision, that the Federal sector provision should be unaffected by the private sector provision, the bootstrap to make clear that courts should not be reading into the Federal sector provision the additional protections or other provisions in the private sector provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.023" offset="7047511">And this Court recognized the significance of that construction, that statutory scheme in the Lehman v. Nakshian case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.142" offset="7075932">In that case, the Court considered whether Federal employees were entitled to a right to a jury trial in an action for discrimination under the Federal sector prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.782" offset="7114488">Private sector employees were entitled to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.067" offset="7123684">And so the plaintiffs in that case made an argument very much similar to the argument made by Petitioners in this case: Well, the private sector provisions covered a jury trial right; it would make no sense not to have a jury trial--</text>

            <text syncTime="1757.762" offset="7202469">Here, as I think you would recognize, retaliation claims go hand in hand with discrimination claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.734" offset="7246355">A person who is discriminated against will quite commonly say: I was not promoted because that was discrimination and then because I complained about it all these bad things happened to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.829" offset="7310720">It's very common that those two go together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.914" offset="7327021">And yet, without any indication that Congress meant to send a Federal employee off to one forum to argue discrimination and another forum to argue retaliation, without any hint that that's what Congress had in mind, it would be rather strange.</text>

            <text syncTime="1814.348" offset="7428794">The Court specifically said on page 162 of its decision that because Congress demonstrated that it knew how to provide a statutory right to a jury trial when it wished to do so elsewhere in the very legislation cited, but in section 633a it explicitly failed to do so, and it said that that was the conclusive point of statutory construction in that case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3535.006" offset="14311432">And, as Justice Stevens noted, they have... they adopted the statute by incorporating the language from Title VII, the exact same language where Title VII's remedial scheme makes clear, and the EEOC's consistent interpretation confirms, that that then prohibits retaliation for complaints of race or gender discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.117" offset="14387919">By incorporating that same language in the ADEA's federal sector provision, Congress necessarily gave it the same scope; and, by doing so, eliminated the various anomalies, to put it mildly, that the Government's position leads to.</text>
