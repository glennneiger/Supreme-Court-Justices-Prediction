            <text syncTime="7.404" offset="175541">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The provision at issue determines which convictions constitute a prior felony for imposition of the Federal firearms ban and its increased penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.295" offset="223083">Its exemption clause prescribes certain ways in which a conviction that otherwise meets that definition is nevertheless exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.615" offset="256416">Specifically, it looks to a State's indication that an offense is deprived of any continuing effect, such as whether the status of an offender's civil rights are the same after a conviction as they were before conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.958" offset="313781">The issue before the Court is whether the statute should be read to exempt convictions for which civil rights were lost and later regained while at the same time not exempting a conviction for which civil rights were never lost, even though both... in the end, both offenders have their civil rights following their conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.972" offset="397790">Congress's underlying objective in drafting the exemption clause was to ensure that Federal law respected a State's considered judgment that a particular offense should not subject a person to the Federal firearms law.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.548" offset="452125">The Seventh Circuit's interpretation, which counted convictions for which rights were never lost, fails to respect that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.868" offset="481382">It disregards the State's unequivocal indication to the Federal statute that an offender is worthy of fully participating in civic life.</text>

            <text syncTime="121.977" offset="633833">And I think that the Government points to Maine as an example where no offenders lose their civil rights, but felons lose their gun rights and certain misdemeanants also lose their gun rights, but get that gun right back.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.157" offset="710528">And in States like Maine and in Vermont, the "unless" clause still applies and still precludes those types of convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.727" offset="740830">So I think when the Government alleges that there are certain anomalies that arise from our interpretation, it is simply not the case, and if they are anomalies that arise from our interpretation--</text>

            <text syncTime="1394.563" offset="5724158">And I think if you look at it this way, too, the... a State, in order to... if the Court decides: Well, sorry, you're out of luck to civil rights retained, if a State wishes to have its less serious offenders avoid the Federal ban, it would have to treat them more harshly than it currently does in order for those offenders to be treated better under Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.077" offset="5818199">And I think that that's an absurd notion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.844" offset="5825304">And I also... I think... I just want to give one what I think is the most clear example, which is the State of North Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.319" offset="5871175">We're not talking about misdemeanors here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.938" offset="5877653">We're talking about felony convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.638" offset="5884445">In North Dakota the State has decided that if a felon is not sentenced to imprisonment, then the felon retains his civil rights, and his right to possess a firearm is restored after a short waiting period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.114" offset="5946408">Whereas, a felon who is convicted to... and sent to prison, his rights are taken away and later restored.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.470" offset="5975769">So we have the result here of the complete opposite of what North Dakota intended, which is to treat the less serious offender accordingly and treat the more serious offender accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.110" offset="6026342">And that's directly contrary to Congress's purpose in passing a firearm owner's protection act, which was in direct response to this Court's holding in Dickerson, which ignored a State's expungement of... of a conviction, which, again, is another way of a State identifying an individual as trustworthy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1528.296" offset="6259146">And I... and I would look to point to the example of Wisconsin and the offenses, in particular, that we're talking about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.216" offset="6286731">For a misdemeanor crime as a repeat offender, before 2003, it was punishable by up to three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.055" offset="6322153">Now Wisconsin has changed that law, and it is only punishable by two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.090" offset="6334274">So it would be exempt under (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.292" offset="6343051">But Wisconsin allows that type of offender to retain civil rights and to retain the rights to possess a firearm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.113" offset="6374398">And, yet, under the government's reading and the Seventh Circuit's reading the Federal statute would ignore that determination by the State and would impose the ban on that individual and require that individual to get on the same footing as a felon to receive a pardon, which are generally not available to misdemeanants but are readily available to... to felons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.894" offset="6461542">And so you are talking about a less serious offender having to seek extraordinary remedies under State laws... and this, I think, is not just unique to the State of Wisconsin... in order to put themselves on the same footing as a more serious offender as identified by that State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.154" offset="6526535">And if I can reserve the rest of my time?</text>

            <text syncTime="1601.441" offset="6551717">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: We just have a two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.345" offset="6579302">The first is that restoring a right does not mean leaving it alone, and the second is that the statute is not absurd.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.749" offset="6600932">And for those reasons, Petitioner's prior offenses are violent felonies under the meaning of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.784" offset="6621098">The statute is clear on point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.753" offset="6628935">It says "restored", and restoring a right means giving back a right that has been taken away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.722" offset="6648788">It does not mean leaving a right alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.091" offset="6658297">And though words can sometimes have different meanings in contexts, we are aware of no context in which "restore" was "leave alone".</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.262" offset="6686927">And this is certainly not such a context because the statute refers to a pardon, a set-aside, an expungement, or a restoration of rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.184" offset="6722662">And the one thing that those four items all have in common is that there are ways which a State essentially undoes its conviction by relieving a defendant of some or all of the consequences of that conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.826" offset="6765190">Giving back rights that have been taken away as part of the conviction has that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.278" offset="6783057">Simply leaving the rights alone does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.812" offset="6793193">And for that reason, because the statute is so clear, the only question in this case is whether the scope of the statutory exemption is so absurd that this Court should take the liberty to amend it in order to add an additional exemption for defendants who never lost their civil rights in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.441" offset="6859648">And the Court should not do so for numerous reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.891" offset="6869470">The first is that the absurd results canon applies only if it is clear that Congress could not possibly have intended the result of the plain statutory text.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.665" offset="6908550">And as the Chief Justice pointed out, and Justice Souter did as well, we know from the subsequent enactment of the domestic violence misdemeanor provision that this result is not something that's beyond Congress's comprehension.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.406" offset="6963511">Everyone agrees that Congress did in fact mandate the supposedly alleged absurd results in a closely analogous statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.078" offset="6990261">And that's just fatal to the absurdity argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="1742.948" offset="7117738">So on the face of that provision... the provision says restoration occurs only if civil rights have been lost.</text>

            <text syncTime="1831.684" offset="7472690">Automatically, let's say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.136" offset="7478437">Automatically and within a short period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.452" offset="7487737">What rationale reason could there be for doing that?</text>

            <label>Mr. Daryl Joseffer</label>
            <text syncTime="1838.187" offset="7498708">--The reason is that Congress was balancing two policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.789" offset="7509052">On the one hand, what it was looking to do in this provision was to defer to a State's decision to essentially undo its conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.526" offset="7536011">And that applies where rights have been taken away and restored, but does not have anything to do with rights being left alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.263" offset="7558999">On the other hand, and a couple of Justices already made this point as well, Congress wanted to apply the Federal firearms disability to serious felonies, to felonies punishable by more than two years of imprisonment, but if Congress had included a retention of rights exemption, that would have all but gutted the statutory prohibition on serious misdemeanants possessing firearms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.344" offset="7639247">And that's why, consistent with Congress's desire to get tough on firearms and impose the firearms disability on serious felons, it couldn't include a retention of rights exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.282" offset="7679057">So it's a situation where Congress had a couple of different policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.734" offset="7692850">It clearly pursued both of them, and as a result, there is a seam, there is this anomaly that Petitioners have pointed to, but that's an inevitable consequence of Congress's desire to balance these two policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.292" offset="7739034">And because that's an inevitable and probably foreseen result of Congress's intent, it doesn't call Congress's intent into question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.112" offset="7766411">In addition, the scope of the anomalies here is really quite minor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.100" offset="7786368">There are... if you... read according to its plain language, there are a few States in which the Petitioner... the anomaly the Petitioner points to occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.222" offset="7826806">It's currently about three States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.388" offset="7831508">It used to be about six States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.788" offset="7837046">On the other hand, if you take Petitioner's view, you create anomaly in a couple other States, which Justice Ginsburg referred to, whereby the most serious offenders, first-degree murderers, would not be treated as having their civil rights restored.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.928" offset="7885634">But in all of these States, the effect of the anomaly is greatly reduced by the firearms exception to the restoration of rights exemption because in... Petitioner's example was North Carolina, where he said that a more serious offender would be able to get firearms rights back promptly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.021" offset="7949999">I guess what he meant by 10 years after completing the sentence if he had not committed further crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.461" offset="7983750">So the incidence of this issue is really not very significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.746" offset="8000886">Instead, the real significance to departing from the plain statutory language would be to gut the statute as applied to misdemeanors punishable by tiers of imprisonment, which is contrary to Congress's clearly expressed intent by including such misdemeanors within the scope of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.355" offset="8059296">Petitioner has also argued at length that what Congress was looking at here was trustworthiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.361" offset="8087403">Did the State find the defendant trustworthy to possess firearms?</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.646" offset="8100465">But we know, and this Court explained in Caron, that that's not what this provision goes to because the whole point of the Federal firearms laws is to prohibit firearms possession in some circumstances where at least some States were permitting it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.221" offset="8150829">So the fact that a State would let a person possess firearms is not relevant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.025" offset="8170055">Instead, Congress was not deferring generally to the States' trustworthiness views but instead was looking to defer to their specific determination to essentially undo their own conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.463" offset="8207776">If a State wanted to undo its own conviction, Congress was willing to give effect to that, but that's the only thing it was deferring to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.348" offset="8231286">And it also bears emphasis that Congress--</text>

            <text syncTime="2046.482" offset="8331805">There's certainly a substantive legal difference there, but as a practical matter, I mean one reason that Congress may have decided not to distinguish between automatic and individualized restorations of rights is simply that it didn't want to attempt to micromanage the States in how they would go about choosing to do a pardon or a restoration of rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.627" offset="8400455">I mean... and... with respect to restoration or rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="2070.681" offset="8428667">As this Court explained in Dickerson, of the States that expunge convictions, many of them do it automatically as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.501" offset="8451968">And so Congress from... because of what it was doing here was advocating Dickerson, was presumably aware of these points this Court had made in Dickerson regarding the great variance in the laws and the fact some of it was automatic.</text>

            <text syncTime="2102.168" offset="8554577">But in any event, I think the point is just that Congress was going to defer to the States' decision to effectively undo their convictions, but was not going to micromanage how the States did it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.995" offset="8609852">But the most that one might determine from that point of view is that if you think that Congress was really thinking about an individualized determination, then what that would mean is that some offenders who get automatic restorations are currently essentially catching a break from the fact that they got an automatic one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.553" offset="8664083">But the fact that the plain language of the statute may give someone of the offenders a break is no reason to depart from the plain language of the statute, to give other offenders a break that Congress clearly did not intend.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.443" offset="8707655">And, Justice Scalia, you asked about what's a typical restoration process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.347" offset="8731270">At the time the statute was enacted in 1986, of the States that did restorations, about half of them did it automatically and about half of them required individualized consideration before returning at least one of the rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="2166.261" offset="8810995">In fact, the 50 States follow 49 different approaches to revoking and restoring civil rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.813" offset="8833147">So there's an exception to just about anything in this area, which again underscores why anomalies are inevitable, and therefore don't really call Congress's intention into question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.084" offset="8862300">But the standard practice is that after a defendant has finished serving his sentence, and that would include not just maybe one day in jail but also the probationary period following that... but after the defendant has finished serving his sentence, if restoration is automatic, it will either be at the conclusion of the sentence or at some time period thereafter, which in some instances can be significantly thereafter.</text>

            <text syncTime="2226.565" offset="9052158">One is that, I mean, the provisions at issue here about the length of sentence served, were in the statute before this amendment was made.</text>

            <text syncTime="2235.754" offset="9088938">So they're not directly relevant to the intent of the '86 Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.788" offset="9101059">But I'm not aware of... I mean, of legislative history predating 1986 in which Congress looked at the length as opposed to the maximum term.</text>

            <text syncTime="2270.724" offset="9228850">First I would like to respond to my colleague's last point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.593" offset="9240239">He speculates that... about legislate history and I think actually it is the exact... exact opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.913" offset="9269601">Congress enacted a Firearm Owners Protection Act to broaden exemptions to the gun control act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.067" offset="9298231">There's no question about that, and it did so in a way that would respect State law decisions about who should be eligible for exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.541" offset="9344102">And secondly, I was asked about... by the Court about substantive difference between automatic restoration of rights versus a State automatically allowing an individual to retain rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.348" offset="9395302">In many instances there's no passage of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.133" offset="9406483">There are no additional conditions that an offender must meet in order to get that restoration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.168" offset="9426545">It is just as automatic as not having them taken away in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.739" offset="9444830">And I think my last point to the Court: If the meaning of restored in (a)(20) is so clear, as the Government says it is, then I don't know why Congress would need to have added language to (a)(33) to clarify that they were limiting that concept to only rights that were taken away and restored.</text>
