            <label>Justice Clarence Thomas</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104719">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.267" offset="129692">Petitioner was arrested after the car he was driving toward the Mexican Boarder was stopped and searched.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.773" offset="155710">Police found nearly $81,000 in cash hidden in a secret compartment in the vehicle and in addition to the evidence that petitioner was involved in drug trafficking found other indications that he had taken elaborate steps to avoid detection of the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.284" offset="233764">After a jury trial, petitioner was convicted of violating the provision of the federal money laundering statute that prohibits the transportation of illicit funds across the boarder while knowing that the transportation was designed to conceal or disguise the nature, location, source, ownership or control of the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.913" offset="324357">The Fifth Circuit affirmed his conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.610" offset="339090">Petitioner raises the same two arguments here that the Court of Appeals rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.812" offset="363958">First, that a money laundering conviction requires proof that he attempted to create the appearance of legitimate wealth and second, that the statute cannot be satisfied by proof that petitioner merely hid the funds in transit.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.980" offset="432608">In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.326" offset="453924">First, although we agree that money laundering may be commonly understood as making illicit gains appear legitimate, we must be guided by the statutory text and here it contains no such limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.013" offset="512752">We also reject petitioner's argument that this requirement is inherent in the statutory elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.172" offset="541382">Concealing or disguising one of the listed attributes would not necessarily make the funds appear more legitimate nor would disclosing one of the attributes necessarily reveal the funds as legitimate or illegitimate, that is.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.410" offset="606270">Second, we agree that petitioner -- with petitioner that evidence of secretive efforts during transportation, even the elaborate tactics used here is not sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that petitioner knew that the transportation itself was designed to conceal or disguise the funds, nature, location, source, ownership, or control.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.256" offset="713686">We read the design to conceal or disguise element to mean that a defendant must have known that the transportation was intended to achieve the effect of concealing or disguising a list of attributes of the funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.578" offset="778992">Although the secretive manner in which petitioner transported the cash may be probative of his knowledge that the transportation was so designed, it is not itself sufficient proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.904" offset="828311">The only direct evidence the Government introduced as to the purpose of the transportation was that it was designed to compensate the leaders of the drug trafficking organization which plainly says nothing about a design to conceal or disguise a listed attribute.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.257" offset="897692">Nor did the Government introduce evidence from which petitioner's knowledge of a purpose to conceal or disguise a listed attribute could be inferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.514" offset="934681">On this evidence the jury could reasonably have found all of the elements of the statute satisfied beyond the reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.951" offset="968432">Justice Alito has filed the concurring opinion in which the Chief Justice and Justice Kennedy have joined.</text>
