            <text syncTime="9.059" offset="206542">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The virtues of reading Congress' grant of the stamp tax exemption, 1146(c), to only post-confirmation transfers is threefold.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.790" offset="253458">First, it's faithful to the language of the statute, which requires that there be a plan confirmed, as the courts in NVR and Hechinger have held, and draws a simple bright-line test at the point of confirmation, at which point the bankruptcy judge has the power to grant that tax exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.939" offset="310092">It's also based upon the principle that taxation exemption statutes, which this is a case involving one, must be narrowly construed if they are to stay under principles of federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.468" offset="344260">It also avoids the intrusion into the State's tax system, keeping in mind the important fact that approximately three-quarters of these Chapter 11 cases never get to plan confirmation.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.166" offset="386996">Instead, in three quarters of the cases you have, as in Lamie and in the Hartford case, you may have a case convert to Chapter 7 or have it be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.349" offset="419702">So a pre-confirmation tax exemption granted by the bankruptcy judge at any point prior to confirmation--</text>

            <text syncTime="73.299" offset="463483">--Well, Justice Breyer, what happens in these situations is that a... for example, a 363 sale order where the property is being sold, in that order there is an exemption granted by the bankruptcy judge.</text>

            <text syncTime="86.684" offset="517086">Isn't that... I mean, I assume that's totally illegal, that you get... I thought we're talking about this provision where everybody agrees that it has to be under a plan confirmed under section 1129.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.493" offset="568286">So if there's no plan confirmed, I don't know how you would fall within this exemption.</text>

            <text syncTime="106.676" offset="597021">If it's your point exactly, then I guess I must agree with that.</text>

            <text syncTime="110.658" offset="613008">Except I thought your point was it makes it difference whether the transfer takes place before the plan is confirmed or after.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.327" offset="647594">So I may be just confused about that.</text>

            <label>Mr. Scott D. Makar</label>
            <text syncTime="120.671" offset="653027">Well, what happens in these situations before confirmation where there is a 363 order that transfers, that the bankruptcy court then says this is entitled to an exemption, at that point in time the State of Florida or whatever State is denied the revenue that would otherwise--</text>

            <text syncTime="135.898" offset="713945">You then concede... let me for my own point of view; forget what the... maybe I'm confused about the facts or maybe I'm not.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.927" offset="746023">But let's suppose there is a plan and it is confirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.033" offset="766503">The transfer, however, took place a month earlier where a private group of creditors came together, every creditor, with the debtor and they worked out a sale tomorrow, and they transferred the assets tomorrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.213" offset="839228">Four months later, the plan that includes every word of that goes before the bankruptcy judge, the bankruptcy judge thoroughly understands the situation, and he says: I confirm the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.317" offset="907565">Now, under those... in that circumstance, I guess you now are... are you prepared to concede that Florida cannot tax?</text>

            <label>Mr. Scott D. Makar</label>

            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="193.609" offset="944763">Of course not.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.155" offset="946957">So then... then the fact that there is no plan seems to me irrelevant, that situation, from the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.199" offset="979140">So now let's look at this case, where there is a plan and it is confirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.667" offset="997008">My question, going back to what I thought the facts are, is this: Imagine the situation I've just described... thorough investigation later by the bankruptcy judge; plan including it is confirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.004" offset="1058343">And you say if the transfer took place first you can assert your tax, but if the transfer took place second, after the plan, you can't.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.234" offset="1099303">And my question, if I'm right on my assumption, is I'd like you to provide a reason why any human being, a reasonable human being, would want to make that distinction?</text>
            <text syncTime="247.369" offset="1159803">Why would anyone want to say we want to give all the money to the creditors and not let Florida get some if it takes place, the transfer, after the confirmation, but would think differently about it and would want Florida to get some if the transfer takes place before the confirmation, which confirmation describes everything in depth, is thoroughly investigated, et cetera?</text>
            <text syncTime="275.014" offset="1270353">What reason could there be for such a distinction?</text>

            <text syncTime="281.199" offset="1295117">First of all, the Bankruptcy Code speak in terms of a... 1146(c) speaks in terms of a "plan confirmed".</text>

            <text syncTime="290.821" offset="1333569">I want you to forget about the language and assume the language is ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.021" offset="1354467">That's a different question.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.771" offset="1361468">My question is, assuming that the language is ambiguous, as every lower court has found, assuming that, however, is there any reason why a reasonable human being would make this distinction?</text>
            <text syncTime="312.203" offset="1419147">That's my question.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.827" offset="1429596">And there may be an answer, but I want to know what answer is.</text>

            <text syncTime="328.212" offset="1483199">Well, Justice Breyer, I think the practical reason is Congress has created a structured Bankruptcy Code, in which there is a plan confirmation process structure that Congress has provided here.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.769" offset="1533458">And in this particular case, and in perhaps the hypothetical, this was done outside the plan confirmation process.</text>

            <text syncTime="355.075" offset="1590614">I mean, you go back three years and say, well, you know, the bankruptcy judge can say, part of what I'm confirming is the sale that took place three years ago, so you can file for a refund, I guess.</text>

            <text syncTime="1536.558" offset="6316583">Without cash, you cannot even get to confirmation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.011" offset="6326405">The way in which most debtors generate the cash necessary to get to confirmation, to pay all of the things that have to be paid in cash on confirmation is through asset sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.771" offset="6369455">In fact, this tax exemption is more important for pre-confirmation transfers to the confirmation process than post-confirmation transfers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.830" offset="6405609">Here in this case, if you look at the joint appendix page 127, you can see the things that had to be paid on confirmation of this plan, including administrative expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.092" offset="6442702">In section 1129, Congress set forth the rule that certain things have to be paid in cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.745" offset="6469347">Every dollar that is spent to pay a stamp tax cannot be used to pay employee claims, cannot be used to pay for goods and services the debtor desperately needs to reorganize, and cannot be offered to creditors to get their vote in favor of the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.240" offset="6527339">There is no reason, no reasonable reason why Congress would have wanted to allow the exemption for a thousand-dollar transfer that occurs after confirmation, but not to a ten-million-dollar transfer that occurs just prior to confirmation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2119.810" offset="8649527">Because section 365(g) addresses assumptions or rejections of executory contracts under a plan confirmed under Chapter 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.102" offset="8686725">That cannot happen post confirmation because, as this Court said properly in Bildisco, assumption or rejection must occur prior to confirmation of a plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="2147.688" offset="8761122">And we think it means a transfer that occurs either before or after confirmation as long as you have a confirmed plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.482" offset="8800306">Now, it's also critical that where Congress intended to foreclose the debate to require that there be a plan first, such as in section 1142(b) or section 511(b), Congress said "under a confirmed plan".</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.570" offset="8852655">You cannot insert a verb between confirmed and plan, where it's confirmed plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.866" offset="8869791">In this section, Congress... in 1146(a), Congress said plan confirmed under section 1129.</text>

            <text syncTime="2188.705" offset="8925171">Again, in section 1142(b), Congress expressly dealt with transfers under a plan... under a confirmed plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.826" offset="8957667">And in context, that distinct language means there was a plan first, and then it authorizes parties under the plan to make the transfers that are authorized under the confirmed plan.</text>
