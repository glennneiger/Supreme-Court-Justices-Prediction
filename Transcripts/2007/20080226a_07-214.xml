            <text syncTime="1641.238" offset="6734531">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to begin with the same point that Mr. Olson began with, namely, does the False Claims Act... is the False Claims Act directed solely at schemes to defraud the government or does it encompass schemes to defraud people who receive Federal money?</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.665" offset="6800255">And we're in agreement with Petitioners that the False Claims Act is directed at schemes to defraud the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.187" offset="6830348">Our theory in this case is not that the subcontractors are potentially liable because they may have attempted to defraud the prime contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.876" offset="6865143">Our theory is that the subcontractors are potentially liable because they are alleged to have used false representations made to the prime contractors but with the ultimate purpose of defrauding the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.684" offset="6916343">And I think if you imagine what would have happened if the allegations in this case are true and if the fraudulent scheme had been carried to completion, it's very clear that the government, rather than the prime contractors, would have been the injured party.</text>

            <text syncTime="1702.210" offset="6978410">Let's say Allison Engine is defrauding Bath, but Bath makes ships for a lot of people, boats, whatever they make.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.863" offset="7009026">Allison Engine is defrauding, saying these engines, you know, work this way and, in fact, they don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.501" offset="7027625">It doesn't know Bath is going to use some of them in a government ship as opposed to a private ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.786" offset="7044761">So you're saying in that context, since there's no intent to defraud the government, there's no liability?</text>

            <text syncTime="1776.905" offset="7277251">But that all comes out of the hide of the contractor.</text>

            <text syncTime="2607.408" offset="10599190">Because of that, the Navy imposed rigid requirements on all who work on its generator sets in manufacturing those generator sets.</text>

            <text syncTime="3020.039" offset="12249711">But I have two answers for you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.558" offset="12259847">First, if you look at the '82 version of the statute, there were six liability provisions set out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.997" offset="12289626">A seventh was added in '86, (a)(7).</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.730" offset="12300493">But of the first six that were added in '82, when they broke this long sentence down into parts, every one of those provisions except for (a)(2} dealt with either "by the government" or "defrauding the government".</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.440" offset="12359321">(A)(7) likewise has such similar language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.494" offset="12375622">My first point to you is that I believe that when Congress amended this statute in '86 it wanted all provisions to be consistent with each other in that sense that we're talking about fraud on the government, not fraud against private parties, fraud on the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.372" offset="12443122">The second response I would make to you, Mr. Chief Justice, is that we don't read "by the government" as meaning presented to the government or even paid by the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.161" offset="12486276">We read (a)(2), because without that language on (a)(2), if you read the definition of (a)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.809" offset="12560882">By adding the words "by the government", the Congress has limited this to directing to Federal funds.</text>

            <text syncTime="3547.933" offset="14361346">In the first place, the invoices were not submitted to the Navy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.167" offset="14378273">We know that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.603" offset="14380049">That's the provision that I quoted before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.705" offset="14392379">The Plaintiffs in this case did not call a single Navy witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.990" offset="14413590">They did not call the prime contractor as a witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.775" offset="14424666">So we don't know what the Navy received, or what the Navy did not receive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.113" offset="14442012">With respect to the so called certification, that is addressed on pages 57a through 59a of the cert petition appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.952" offset="14481404">This is a district court decision, three pages of discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.189" offset="14498332">This was an argument that the relators came up with relatively late when they couldn't explain why they didn't have the invoices or what actually went to the Navy, and they argued that Bath submitted a false implied certification.</text>

            <text syncTime="3650.750" offset="14772617">Under (a)(2), Justice Stevens, you could submit a statement intending to get a false claim approved or paid by the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.523" offset="14803651">Now, the government can't approve anything if it's not actually submitted to it, or not intended to be submitted to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.760" offset="14828624">That's in the same section of... of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.545" offset="14843775">Let me... let me turn to the... this is a penal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.497" offset="14859553">There is a punitive statute, as you pointed out, in the Vermont versus Stevens case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.901" offset="14877212">There is no meaningful limitation on what the government and the Respondents want in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.721" offset="14900513">The government has now come up with this limitation: Well, it must be really a government project.</text>
            <text syncTime="3687.440" offset="14919321">Well, that isn't in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.208" offset="14926426">That's basically the same thing you unanimously rejected in the Tanner case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3693.827" offset="14944921">The government said in its brief if the government is the ultimate source of the funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3698.981" offset="14965506">That goes back to the example that the Chief Justice was making.</text>
            <text syncTime="3702.450" offset="14979403">There might be 15 different layers, the way this government works.</text>
            <text syncTime="3706.437" offset="14995390">Money is fungible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3707.620" offset="15000092">It's impossible to trace.</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.289" offset="15006779">This statute is intended to address claims made, or statements made in connection with claims made, to... to commit to defraud the government, and defraud the government irrespective of the definition of (a), but was not put in section (a), the liability section.</text>
            <text syncTime="3729.267" offset="15086714">The Congress knows how to put those words in statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3732.404" offset="15099253">They were in the major fraud statute, the... the case that this Court distinguished in Dixon, in... in Tanner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3738.975" offset="15125479">The Dixon case was money given... paid to or on behalf of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3744.129" offset="15146064">There is language like that throughout the congressional statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3748.164" offset="15162260">We don't know in this case whether the government was defrauded, or was intended to be defrauded, because there is this big space between what went on between the subcontractors and the shipbuilders and what went on between the shipbuilders and the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3763.756" offset="15224640">There could have been all kinds of dialogue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3766.042" offset="15233731">There could have been disclosures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3767.392" offset="15239164">There might be deviations from the specifications in any kind of government contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3772.529" offset="15259749">But this statute has to have a limitation point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3775.981" offset="15273542">And if you look at it from 1863 up to the present, it is intended just as the Tanner case said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3781.968" offset="15297470">And in Marcus versus Hess you said that the criminal false claim statutes have to be construed identically with the civil false claims provisions if they contain identical language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3793.360" offset="15343027">371 has the same language as the False Claims Act's, and the Tanner case is dispositive.</text>
