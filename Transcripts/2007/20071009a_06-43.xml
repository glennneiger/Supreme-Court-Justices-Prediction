            <text syncTime="9.009" offset="207256">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The text of section 10(b) as well as the rule 10b-5 promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission prohibit the use of any deceptive device by any person, indirectly or indirectly, in connection with the purchase or sale of a security.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.611" offset="305686">The various deceptive devices used by the Respondents in this case is conduct that is squarely covered by the text of the statute and by the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.529" offset="349363">Respondents here were not passive bystanders facilitating a fraud by Charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.075" offset="371514">Their deceptive conduct was integral to the scheme to create fictitious advertising revenues for Charter to report to investors.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.148" offset="411848">Respondents agreed to overcharge Charter so that they could receive the money from Charter to then return to it for the advertising, using Charter's very--</text>
            <text syncTime="72.409" offset="460853">same money for the purchase of the advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.440" offset="472974">Respondent Scientific-Atlanta created a document falsely claiming that the reason for the increased payments from Charter were because of increased manufacturing expenses.</text>

            <text syncTime="98.805" offset="566492">They were able to show that advertising works.</text>

            <text syncTime="112.878" offset="622812">But the problem was that they were creating the illusion that it wasn't free advertising, but rather that they were purchasing the advertising.</text>

            <text syncTime="128.779" offset="686342">And the obvious purpose for creating the illusion that they were purchasing the advertising rather than receiving free advertising was so that Charter can incorporate these increased revenues in their financial statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.522" offset="749350">And Respondents understood,--</text>
            <text syncTime="147.083" offset="759590">they understood that in order to... for Charter to pass this by their accountants, to deceive the accountants... and this is reflected in the indictment... in order to deceive the accountants for Charter, the Respondents were told that there had to be separate agreements for both the advertising agreements and the purchase agreements.</text>

            <text syncTime="170.715" offset="854153">Mr. Grossman, is there any reason why, in principle, the elements for a cause of action under 10b-5 have to be the same as the elements for a cause of action by the agency under 10(b)?</text>
            <text syncTime="189.754" offset="930326">I mean, we, we created this, this cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.235" offset="956239">It's not set forth in the statute, although other private causes of action are.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.421" offset="976928">If it's our creation, couldn't we sensibly limit it so that, for example, schemes can be attacked by the SEC, but schemes do not form the basis for private attorney general's actions?</text>
            <text syncTime="223.631" offset="1065745">You need actual conveyance of a misrepresentation to the injured party.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.704" offset="1106078">Is there any reason why we couldn't do that?</text>

            <text syncTime="235.282" offset="1112347">Well, I think there are two reasons, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.734" offset="1122169">The first is that at this point in time... I think as the Court recognized in Dura fairly recently... that when Congress enacted the Private Security Law Reform Act, that at that time they accepted--</text>
            <text syncTime="256.118" offset="1195730">the private right of action that this Court had previously inferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.678" offset="1209941">And this Court had previously inferred the private right of action not only for the section but each of the rules in Section 10(b).</text>

            <text syncTime="269.018" offset="1247348">But it's not like under the Sherman Act, where we have reason to think Congress intended the Court to go about the business of construing and developing antitrust law.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.156" offset="1279844">In fact, they have kind of taken over for us.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.187" offset="1287994">They are imposing certain limits on when actions can be brought, proposing particular specific elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.716" offset="1310146">In one of the provisions, 20(e), specifying the SEC can bring an action but private investors can't.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.479" offset="1337209">I mean, we don't get in this business of implying private rights of action any more.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.976" offset="1355181">And isn't the effort by Congress to legislate a good signal that they have kind of picked up the ball and they are running with it and we shouldn't?</text>

            <text syncTime="387.018" offset="1719328">It recognized that there would be multiple primary violators of 10(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="392.360" offset="1740749">It did that in connection with proportionate liability--</text>

            <text syncTime="3474.527" offset="14069395">I... excuse me, I have three quick points to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.808" offset="14078486">One, Mr. Shapiro and Mr. Hungar both said--</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.290" offset="14092383">that the advertising cost the vendors no money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.836" offset="14106594">Well, if the advertising cost them no money, why was there a contract that they entered into for the purchase of advertising?</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.989" offset="14135224">Clearly it was designed to give the false appearance that Charter had this additional $17 million in revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.501" offset="14165212">Number two, the SEC did take a position in the Simpson case as it submitted an amicus brief; Commissioner Cox testified before a House committee this past spring that they wanted to submit the same brief on the same points supporting the position that we are taking here; and the testimony of Commissioner Cox is appended to the briefs of Congressmen Franks and Conyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.004" offset="14279315">Number three, Central Bank did not turn on reliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.535" offset="14293421">Central Bank turned on the issue of deceptive conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.174" offset="14307945">There was no deceptive conduct in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.454" offset="14317036">The plaintiffs conceded there was no deceptive conduct; the court of appeals and the district court said there was no deceptive conduct; it was strictly an aiding-and-abetting case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.778" offset="14354339">With respect to the reliance issue in Central Bank, what the Court did say was under plaintiff's theory he wouldn't have to prove reliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.495" offset="14385268">He only had to prove that he... that the defendant--</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.962" offset="14399061">substantially assisted a defendant who engaged in a primary violation, but he would not have to prove any reliance by the aiding and abettor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.926" offset="14435005">Number three, with respect to 20(e), how do my friends on the other side read 20(e) in connection with section 9 and section 18 of the Exchange Act, each of which provides remedies and private rights of actions against multiple parties?</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.998" offset="14503237">Under their definition, that would appear to be displaced by 20(e).</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.277" offset="14520373">20(e) was not designed, it was not intended to do anything but to give the SEC the right to bring the very type of aiding-and-abetting action that this Court barred in Central Bank.</text>
