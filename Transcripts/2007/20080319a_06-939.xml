            <text syncTime="83.099" offset="502987">I think that the cases of this Court and the cases of the NLRB have made clear that free, open, robust debate is important on all matters having to do with the union/employer relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.574" offset="552829">That was certainly what the Court noted in Linn.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.942" offset="562337">The fact that employer speech is, I think, absolutely critical to an employee being well-enough informed to make an informed judgment about whether to say yes or no to a union, further underscores the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.333" offset="619911">A union election or any situation involving a contest of any sort between a union and an employer is something on which both parties should have the right to speak, and to speak in a noncoercive way, and I think that clearly the National Labor Relations Act promotes that.</text>

            <text syncTime="140.500" offset="732551">In several statutes, the Congress has said this Federal money will go to the grantee, if the grantee says it will not use any money that we give them to assist, promote, or deter union organizing.</text>

            <text syncTime="163.682" offset="825234">Your Honor, those are three statutes that the court below and Respondents rely on heavily.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.019" offset="846654">Those statutes, first of all, I don't think in any way reflect the meaning or the sense of Congress that employer speech is to be inhibited in connection with union organizing.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.811" offset="889808">Those in no way, I think, reflect the overall intent of Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="203.157" offset="983222">But certainly in doing that, Congress didn't in any way modify the NLRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.282" offset="1019689">There's nothing in the legislative history of those statutes that suggests that this Court's principles, as laid down in Machinists and Garmon, were in any way to be inhibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.554" offset="1056783">And, moreover, what Congress can do certainly doesn't mean that the States have the same right.</text>

            <text syncTime="232.709" offset="1101400">--Well, it's not modified in the same way that AB 1889 modifies it, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.713" offset="1121358">First of all, under those statutes there is no requirement that funds be segregated.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.498" offset="1140584">There is no possibility of litigation, treble damages to follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.735" offset="1161482">There is no possibility of attorneys' fees to the prevailing party.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.037" offset="1174752">So those statutes are, I think, are really unique and don't in any way change the basic principle that I think all labor lawyers would agree, and that is that, under the National Labor Relations Act, all parties to a union election or any issue between a union and an employer have the right to speak in a noncoercive way.</text>

            <text syncTime="279.937" offset="1290318">And they also say... by the way, that you answer this, I'd keep this in mind... you may be right about it being too much of an administrative burden, the treble damages et cetera, but they've made major concessions here, and they say that's a matter to be worked out on remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.630" offset="1349041">And it may be that they have to be very careful about inhibiting your speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.684" offset="1369312">So let's go back over those administrative provisions one by one.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.736" offset="1385508">They are suggesting to us, as I read it, don't do that now.</text>

            <text syncTime="310.241" offset="1411526">First of all the notion that one can use your own money, to use the vernacular, and use it to speak, doesn't answer the most basic question that the statute presents, and that is that whether you can or you can't... and I'll get to that in a moment... the fact is that California has regulated, used its spending power to make labor policy, something that this Court has made clear, in Gould and various other cases, it cannot do.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.893" offset="1518105">But even getting past that, which I think is the end of the case, there are certain employers, certain Petitioners here who are a hundred percent funded by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.332" offset="1559901">They have no ability, as a result... when I say "funded by the State" I mean they depend for their income on State programs, let's say... they have no ability, none, to speak to employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="807.601" offset="3400907">But what a nursing home has to do is to track every single possible circumstance under which an employee of the nursing home engaged in speech that was designed to assist... which don't happen very often, presumably... promote or deter union organizing.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.745" offset="3477498">And let me try to bring it down to what really happens in the union organizing campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.280" offset="3491709">This is, by and large, a seven-day-a-week, 24-hour a day operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.482" offset="3508532">There are any number of encounters during the course of the union organizing drive that the employer responsible for complying with AB 1899 may never even know about.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.271" offset="3547611">So, for example, if an employee goes to his supervisor and says union X is trying to organize nursing home, what do you know about union X?</text>
            <text syncTime="854.229" offset="3587421">And the supervisor says, well, the only thing I know about union X is they used to represent the nursing home across the street, and then that nursing home is now closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.751" offset="3625560">Now, that may be a purely factual statement, purely true statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.238" offset="3643532">That's certainly what the employer would argue.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.605" offset="3652936">What the union might argue is that no, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.874" offset="3662027">You have to put that in context, and that was a statement designed to deter the employee from voting for union X.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.194" offset="3687314">Now, if the employer guesses wrong on that issue, that is the employer says, well, this is factual, it's not something designed to deter union organizing, he is subject under the statute to litigation for not having segregated... and I don't know what he would really segregate; the statute is unclear.</text>

            <text syncTime="3417.840" offset="13841945">It said when it talked about the dissent had said what this State is doing is violating the First Amendment, and the Ninth Circuit's response is no, that's not right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.112" offset="13883010">All this is is withholding a subsidy, and the First Amendment cases are clear: that's not regulation of a speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.802" offset="13909759">What the Ninth Circuit thought erroneously is that Boston Harbor had denied it the right to take that same view, because it thought that Boston Harbor said that everything is regulation unless it's market participation, and that's not what Boston Harbor said, and this is not regulation.</text>

            <label>Mr. Willis J. Goldsmith</label>
            <text syncTime="3457.648" offset="14001188">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.750" offset="14013518">I'd just like to make a few comments in rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.404" offset="14028146">First of all, the preamble of the statute makes it absolutely clear as to what the State's purpose is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.141" offset="14055105">It's at page 3a of the appendix of the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.093" offset="14066912">It says it is the policy of the State not to interfere with an employee's choice about whether to join or to be represented by a labor union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.032" offset="14102647">For this reason the State should not subsidize... and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.484" offset="14120515">So clearly the State has a labor policy position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.036" offset="14134726">It's a position as I said at the outset that is completely contrary to that of the NLRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.856" offset="14158027">The NLRA's position is that employers just like unions ought to have the right to speak in a noncoercive way to their employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.760" offset="14189583">Secondly, it is not our position that the NLRA requires the State to fund activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.882" offset="14226050">It is our position that the NLRA and the decisions of this Court make it abundantly clear that the States are to stay out of this area altogether, period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.923" offset="14266278">And that would be the case whether it is the kind of statute that Justice Scalia was posing a question about, whether it was in effect anti-union or pro-union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.379" offset="14304104">It doesn't matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.229" offset="14307447">They are both pre-empted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.479" offset="14312463">The State has no business making labor policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.099" offset="14326987">The decisions of this Court, the unanimous decisions of this Court in several circumstances I think make that very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.420" offset="14352274">And the Ninth Circuit did find that for all practical purposes, the State was regulating by making labor policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.407" offset="14380172">If I could make two points about neutrality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.193" offset="14387278">First of all, the statute is anything but neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.478" offset="14400443">First of all, the State's policy is not one of neutrality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.679" offset="14417266">As I just read from the preamble they have a position; the position is that noncoercive employer speech interferes with employee free choice, and the statute follows that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.237" offset="14455509">The decision to withdraw funds is not the same thing as being neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.058" offset="14478811">Your Honor made a reference to the Hyde amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.676" offset="14493230">The Hyde amendment, Congress withdrew funds from... from abortion practitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.580" offset="14520920">It was not neutral about abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.949" offset="14530324">And California here has made a judgment about noncoercive speech.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3594.234" offset="14547461">What about the Lyng case that Mr. Gottesman cited in response to that argument?</text>

            <label>Mr. Willis J. Goldsmith</label>
            <text syncTime="3598.222" offset="14563447">The Lyng case seems to me to be completely off the point on the pre-emption issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.939" offset="14582360">But there is no question, Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, that Congress can make judgments about what it chooses to fund or not to fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.029" offset="14618618">That did not open the door to the States to do whatever they wanted to do by way of funding or not funding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.718" offset="14645472">Lyng addressed a constitutional--</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3620.601" offset="14652995">Well, Lyng said that the... that Congress was being neutral not that it was making a choice on how to spend its funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.969" offset="14674416">And I understood Mr. Gottesman's point to be that so too, here, California is being neutral.</text>

          <turn speaker="willis_j_goldsmith" startTime="3630.457" stopTime="3698.247">
            <label>Mr. Willis J. Goldsmith</label>
            <text syncTime="3630.457" offset="14692388">--But California is... is not being neutral, not just because of what the preamble says but because of the add-ons to the statute if you will.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.961" offset="14722376">California has taken it much farther than simply withdrawing the subsidy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.931" offset="14738259">California has taken it to the point that you're exposed to treble damages, but then you have minute tracking and segregation of fund details, and California has taken it even one step farther and said on the other hand, if you want to spend State money to facilitate union organizing, that's perfectly fine with us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.892" offset="14814118">You can spend money to give access to union representatives to property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.927" offset="14830210">You can use State money to... to facilitate neutrality agreements of one sort or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3673.283" offset="14863647">Anything that would help a union organize employees, that's fine by us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3677.985" offset="14882455">So California is not neutral in the same way that Lyng was neutral, but again I would suggest that, Mr. Chief Justice, that Lyng didn't open the door, any more than Rust or Regan opened the door to the States to make labor policy by granting or withholding moneys in any way that they saw fit.</text>
