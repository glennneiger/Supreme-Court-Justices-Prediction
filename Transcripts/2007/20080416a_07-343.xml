            <text syncTime="9.543" offset="211393">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This country has not executed anyone for a rape of any kind in over 43 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.774" offset="244307">Louisiana's attempt to reintroduce this practice into American society violates the Eighth Amendment for two distinct reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.365" offset="274714">First, a long-standing national consensus exists against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.019" offset="293313">Indeed, Louisiana's capital rape law is particularly at odds with national values because Louisiana is the only State in which Petitioner, as a non-recidivist, could be subject to the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.531" offset="335318">Second, Louisiana's law violates this Court's Eighth Amendment-narrowing jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.435" offset="354962">It gives juries unfettered discretion to choose who, among the vast class of offenders convicted of child rape, may be subject to the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.871" offset="384637">Now, this is in stark contrast to the handful of other States that have capital rape laws that they've recently enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.368" offset="410655">Texas, for example, requires an offender to have served a prior sentence for the same crime of 25 years before--</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="66.208" offset="438031">Our jurisprudence just requires the narrowing of the death penalty to be... to particularly heinous crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.767" offset="472304">And one could say that rape is in and of itself particularly heinous, rape of a child of 12 or under.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="81.640" offset="499785">--It's no doubt a serious crime, Justice Scalia, but I believe this Court's narrowing jurisprudence requires narrowing beyond a particularly heinous crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.713" offset="548059">Of course, in Godfrey and Gregg against Georgia, this Court said that deliberate murder is not on its own enough to subject an offender to the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.022" offset="581287">So there's two problems that arise with Louisiana's statute in the context of this Court's narrowing jurisprudence.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="106.925" offset="600931">How would you describe a particularly heinous rape of a child under 12?</text>
            <text syncTime="112.143" offset="621724">What would make it particularly heinous?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="116.203" offset="638025">Well, there could be several aggravating facts that would make a rape of a child, or indeed of any person, a particularly egregious crime, but in Coker against Georgia, this Court did not simply hold that the Eighth Amendment prohibited imposing the death penalty for the crime of rape; it held that this Court... that the Eighth Amendment prohibited imposing the death penalty for rape with aggravating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.882" offset="732692">Remember in Coker against Georgia, there were two aggravating circumstances in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.350" offset="746590">First, the offender was a recidivist.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.489" offset="759128">He had been convicted of rape three times, was a convicted murder who had escaped from prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.753" offset="784206">Second, he committed the rape in the course of committing other very serious felonies, including kidnapping and robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.704" offset="808030">And so, at the very minimum, the State stands here with the burden today to say that an average child rape is worse than the crime in Coker, that this Court held was not sufficiently superior--</text>

          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="170.432" stopTime="191.534">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="170.432" offset="854945">Suppose... suppose the State says that all recidivist rapists of children under 12 will suffer the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.960" offset="897055">Does it have to narrow that class further?</text>
            <text syncTime="182.991" offset="905205">I mean, the need for narrowing depends upon how narrow the class is described in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.191" offset="933940">Right?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="191.909" offset="940836">I mean, if the law says you have to be a recidivist, you have to have all the other factors that you just mentioned, if the law said that, would you come in and say,</text>
            <text syncTime="200.391" offset="974795">"Oh, no, you can't just give everybody who commits that crime the death penalty? "</text>
            <text syncTime="206.842" offset="1000604">You have to narrow the class.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="207.888" offset="1004784">--Well, no question that would be a much stronger argument under this Court's narrowing jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.559" offset="1023487">Now, you'd still be left with two problems with that kind of a statute: First, you'd still potentially be left with the problem that this Court addressed in Furman and all the subsequent cases of having a large class of offenders of which only a few get the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.883" offset="1072702">Now, there needs to be some reason to differentiate.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.304" offset="1082420">The State might well say... especially the State of Texas and other States that have these very severe recidivist requirements might say that is good enough, but they'd still be left with the... with the argument that they would have to make that a person who convicts... who commits child rape and does not... it does not result any death, is a worse offender than somebody who deliberately kills somebody--</text>

            <text syncTime="264.444" offset="1231004">That would be perfectly consistent with the narrowing jurisprudence, wouldn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="269.957" offset="1253052">Remember Coker tells us, I think, that you can't simply start with rape and then add an aggravating circumstance, in terms of this Court's Eighth Amendment jurisprudence.</text>

            <text syncTime="281.795" offset="1300385">Because the... there was a plurality opinion, right, in Coker?</text>
            <text syncTime="287.779" offset="1324314">And Justice Powell wrote separately, and I thought he left open an outrageous rape resulting in serious, lasting harm to the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.413" offset="1374887">He said that the Coker jury was not asked and could not have found from the facts in that case that the offense was outrageous or want only violent in that it involved a aggravated battery.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.344" offset="1442596">So you don't have an opinion of five Justices saying that, in any and all circumstances, rape that leaves the victim alive cannot be punished by the death penalty.</text>

            <text syncTime="2193.979" offset="8949143">The example that you gave was one of the five instances which the Court said out in the Lowenfield opinion quoting the Louisiana statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.928" offset="8996895">In each of those five instances, nothing need be proved except, as you have put it, the narrowing circumstance in the law enforcement officer in your example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.221" offset="9050080">But under the Louisiana statute which passed muster in Lowenfield, there were five analogs of which the law enforcement officer was one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.215" offset="9094070">Each of those crimes was defined as a killing with a specific intent to kill or specific intent to inflict great bodily harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.507" offset="9147256">And then in each one of these instances, there was an extra element added: Law enforcement officer, intent to kill more than three people in Lowenfield, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.315" offset="9194485">In fact, child under 12 was one of the examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.471" offset="9207128">It seems to me that the... one way to read the Louisiana statute there consistently with the... with the value that Justice Scalia's question raised is this: That Louisiana, in effect, had created a general crime of murder with specific intent to kill or inflict great bodily harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.164" offset="9297825">And then it had given five instances in which, as I put it a moment ago, there was an extra element: And that extra element, whether it be killing more than two people, whether it be killing a child under 12, law enforcement officer, functioned like the aggravating circumstance; so that, in fact, we didn't have a statute that merely said if you kill a law officer intentionally, that's capital, period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.698" offset="9416003">What we had was a capital scheme that says if you kill with specific intent to kill or inflict great bodily harm, that's murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.318" offset="9466472">And if you commit one of these other five other elements, that narrows it down to capital murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.752" offset="9500222">Isn't that a proper way of reading the Louisiana murder statute from which you took your example?</text>

            <text syncTime="2385.216" offset="9714113">You were saying we in Louisiana define murder of a law enforcement officer very narrowly.</text>

            <text syncTime="2400.445" offset="9775030">And my point simply is, I don't think that's the way to read the Louisiana statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.972" offset="9797078">The Louisiana statute instead says killing with intent et cetera is... is capital murder if there is a further circumstance added to it; and five are given.</text>

            <text syncTime="2898.915" offset="11768905">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Few evolving standards of decency are more pronounced that the growing understanding in modern society of the unique and irreparable harm caused by violent child rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.081" offset="11825538">From Jessica's Laws to Megan's Laws to the laws at issue here, elected legislatures have repeatedly acted to deter and to punish violent child rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.202" offset="11874021">In particular, the legislatures of seven States have determined that the very worst child rapists should be eligible for the most serious punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.807" offset="11916444">I'd like to begin by talking about the effect of Coker.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.712" offset="11928043">And Justice Kennedy, you raised in particular the dual aspects of Coker.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.412" offset="11954896">What we suggest the effect of Coker is, is that it has been under a cloud of confusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.536" offset="11971301">A fair reading, a careful reading of Coker in my judgment, it's clear Coker does not reach this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.815" offset="11996483">The Court bent over backwards to explicitly specify that it was adult rape, and indeed the question presented in the briefing in Coker not use the word adult rape at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.655" offset="12039847">It was phrased generally in terms of rape, and the Court repeatedly and I would suggest not accidently added the word adult.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.419" offset="12066910">But that being said, the States have operated since Coker under a great deal of confusion as to what exactly Coker meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.305" offset="12094390">And, indeed, in 1981 the Florida Supreme Court struck down their law believing that it was, quote, "compelled" by Coker.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.552" offset="12127409">And the State legislatures when they act today... in the State of Texas... Texas is the most recent State to even act one of these laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.487" offset="12155099">When the State legislature was considering it, the State legislature asked the Attorney General's Office for advice specifically on whether Coker allowed that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.390" offset="12190730">And there's a great deal of confusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.685" offset="12199925">As Petitioner argues quite passionately, those that are opposed to the death penalty for child rape argue vociferously that Coker does not allow it, as Petitioner has done in many, many pages of briefing.</text>

I have to admit personally I found really quite astonishing, and I was harkened back to some of the issues this Court considered in the Medeillin case because the Law Lords' brief argued that the United States... that this Court has no ability to determine that any other crime is subject to the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.092" offset="13881584">And there were two bases: One was a treaty that the United States has never ratified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.981" offset="13901123">And secondly was this inchoate international law understanding that, because other nations have made a policy determination about the death penalty, that it is forbidden to the U.S. Congress, it is forbidden to the States of the United States, and it is forbidden to this Court to ever acknowledge there is a crime that is consistent with our Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.052" offset="13977401">That brief, to my mind, embodied all of the dangers of the very broad arguments that we're being presented in Medeillin, that ultimately the Constitutional and the people of this country determine what is permissible and what is lawful.</text>

            <text syncTime="3574.581" offset="14471533">I would like to address first the narrowing component of this case and then turn to the idea of trends on the first question presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.186" offset="14513956">First, the reasons for this Court's narrowing jurisprudence is to avoid a situation in which a few, only a few offenders out of a vast pool are given the death penalty, and there's no legal principled explanation to describe why those offenders get the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.616" offset="14583651">Ms. Clark says that Louisiana's law is narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.147" offset="14597757">Well, if you just look at empiric, as best as we've been able to gather statistics and Texas has some similar statistics in its brief, we're talking about under Louisiana's definition of child rape about five times as many individuals per year as are convicted of deliberate murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.546" offset="14659406">This is enormous class.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.624" offset="14667661">And what you end up with is only one every several years getting the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.951" offset="14688976">That is the definition of arbitrary and capriciousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.636" offset="14695768">Justice Breyer, Mr. Cruz is right, Louisiana Supreme Court at 58(a) addressed... addressed... as existed at trial, it included oral rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.710" offset="14748013">I'm not sure exactly under ex post facto which is the operative one or not, but it doesn't matter because even the anal or vaginal component statute still gets you five times as many... than just absolutely being struck by lightning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.017" offset="14797228">Even in Louisiana simply consensual sex between an 18-year-old and a 12-year-old is a capital offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.139" offset="14829724">And so we don't think Louisiana's law sufficiently narrows.</text>
