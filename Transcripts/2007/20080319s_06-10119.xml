            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104696">And this case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the Louisiana Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.692" offset="131445">Petitioner Allen Snyder was convicted of first-degree murder in a Louisiana court and sentenced to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.119" offset="157150">The Louisiana Supreme Court rejected petitioner's claim that the prosecution exercised some of its peremptory strikes based on race in violation of Batson versus Kentucky because we find that the trial court committed clear error in overruling a Batson objection to the strike of juror Jeffrey Brooks, we reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.963" offset="244503">Batson provides a three-step process for trial court to use in deciding a claim regarding a peremptory challenge that is alleged to have been based on race.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.858" offset="292046">This case concerns the third step of that process at which the trial court must determine whether the objecting party had shown intentional discrimination because the third step often involves credibility, determinations and firsthand observations that are peculiarly within the trial court's province, the trial court's ruling should be disturbed only when there is clear error.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.420" offset="382325">The prosecution gave two reasons for striking Mr. Brooks, a college senior.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.933" offset="400402">First, that Mr. Brooks looked nervous during voir dire.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.481" offset="414613">And second, that Mr. Brooks expressed the concern that service on the jury would conflict with his student teaching obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.454" offset="446482">The trial court did not explain the basis for overruling the Batson objection and we therefore cannot presume that the trial judge made a finding on Mr. Brooks' demeanor.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.854" offset="492040">Indeed, the prosecution struck Mr. Brooks a day after he was questioned during voir dire.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.407" offset="514296">The judge may not have even remembered Mr. Brooks' demeanor at that point or may have found it unnecessary to consider his demeanor basing his ruling on the second proffered justification alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.737" offset="559540">The second justification fails even the deferential standard of review applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.524" offset="578766">When Mr. Brooks came forward to express concern that jury service would conflict with his student teaching obligations, the Court called the dean at Mr. Brooks' college.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.434" offset="618368">The dean said that there would not be a problem if Mr. Brooks missed one week of student teaching.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.159" offset="641251">During voir dire, the prosecutor stated that he did not think that the trial would last through the weekend, and it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.873" offset="664134">If Mr. Brooks had served on the jury, he would have missed only two additional days of student teaching.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.177" offset="689316">The implausibility of this explanation is reinforced by the prosecutor's acceptance of white jurors who disclosed conflicting obligations that appeared to have been at least as serious as Mr. Brooks'.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.580" offset="742920">The pretextual explanation of the strike of Mr. Brooks naturally gives rise to an inference of discriminatory intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.298" offset="773849">In other context, we have held that once it is shown that a discriminatory intent was a substantial or motivating factor in an action taken by a state actor, the burden shifts to the State to show that the factor was not determinative.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.047" offset="832781">Assuming that the standard applies in the Batson context, we conclude that the record does not show that the prosecution would have challenged Mr. Brooks based on his alleged nervousness alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.719" offset="875517">We therefore reverse the judgment of the Louisiana Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.962" offset="888474">Justice Thomas has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Scalia has joined.</text>
