            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104744">The section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 requires covered States to obtain federal preclearance before making any change in their voting practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.247" offset="161691">This case presents a novel question concerning the meaning of the word "change" in the context of Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.233" offset="197635">The voting practice at issue is the method used to film midterm vacancies on the commission governing Mobile, Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.138" offset="237237">In 1985, Alabama passed and obtained preclearance of an act substituting special elections for the earlier installed practice of gubernatorial appointment.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.184" offset="293453">When the next midterm vacancy occurred in 1987, the governor, in keeping with the 1985 Act pulled a special election.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.013" offset="340786">But before the election took place, a voter challenged the 1985 Act in state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.326" offset="374014">The challenger urged that the Act did not comply with the requirements set out in Alabama's constitution for enacting laws, not of statewide governments but applicable to one county only.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.363" offset="442142">The trial court rejected the challenge and allowed the election to go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.016" offset="468786">The year after the winner took office, however, the Alabama Supreme Court reversed the trial court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.699" offset="499506">The State Supreme Court held that the 1985 law authorizing special elections indeed did violate the State Constitutions' instruction on the passage of local laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.355" offset="558125">Accordingly, when the next midterm vacancy occurred in 2005, Governor Bob Riley in line with the Alabama Supreme Court's decision, sought to fill the opening by appointment.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.244" offset="613714">A group of plaintiffs led by appellee, Yvonne Kennedy, then filed this suit in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.610" offset="659167">The practice of gubernatorial appointment to Kennedy led plaintiffs maintained, was a change from the special election held under the 1985 law.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.855" offset="708068">Therefore, they argued Section 5 barring Alabama from filling the vacancy by appointment rather than election unless the State first obtained preclearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.938" offset="760417">Adopting the view advanced by the plaintiffs, a three-judge panel of the District Court granted them declaratory and injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.785" offset="799810">Governor Riley appealed that decision to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.186" offset="817469">We first project the Kennedy's plaintiffs now appellee's contention that the governor's appeal was untimely.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.770" offset="851742">On the merits, we reversed the District Court and hold that for Section 5 purposes, the invalidated 1985 law never gained force or effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.058" offset="904927">Therefore, the States reversing to its prior practice in accord with the decision of the Alabama Supreme Court did not rank as a change requiring preclearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.139" offset="953201">Our decision today rests on an extraordinary circumstance, not present in any past case interpreting the Section 5 term in force or effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.652" offset="1003252">The 1985 law was challenged at earliest opportunity, the lone election was held in the shadow of that legal challenge and the law was ultimately invalidated by the Alabama Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.920" offset="1064378">That Court's prerogative to say what Alabama law is, merits respect in federal forms, much as this Court's decisions on question to federal law command respect in state forums.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.993" offset="1128640">A state law invalidated by a State Supreme Court under the circumstances presented here is properly regarded as void from the start and therefore incapable of establishing a voting practice for Section 5 purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.693" offset="1203454">A contrary holding in this case, we note, would have the anomalous effect of binding the state to a practice improperly enacted under the State's Constitution, and we do so simply because the state trial court misread Alabama law and therefore, erroneously allowed the 1987's special election to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.707" offset="1299480">For these reasons and others detailed in our opinion, we conclude that Section 5 did not require Alabama to obtain preclearance before reinstating the practice of gubernatorial appointment.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.011" offset="1356741">Accordingly, we reverse the District Court's judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.821" offset="1371996">Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Souter joins.</text>
