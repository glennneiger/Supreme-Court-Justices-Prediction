            <text syncTime="10.872" offset="235673">Mr. Waxman.</text>

            <label>Mr. Seth P. Waxman</label>
            <text syncTime="12.574" offset="242465">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Petitioners in these cases have three things in common.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.145" offset="268692">First, all have been confined at Guantanamo for almost six years, yet not one has ever had meaningful notice of the factual grounds of detention or a fair opportunity to dispute those grounds before a neutral decision-maker.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.506" offset="334207">Two, under the decision below, they have no prospect of getting that opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.910" offset="359807">And three, each maintains, as this Court explained in Rasul, that he is quote "innocent of all wrongdoing".</text>
            <text syncTime="50.183" offset="392930">Now the government contends that these men are detainable, and the facts of these 37 cases differ, and it may well that be that an adjudicatory process that preserves the core features of common law habeas would reveal perhaps that some of these Petitioners are lawfully detainable.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.494" offset="470148">But limited DTA review of the structurally flawed CSRT process cannot provide any reliable examination of the Executive's asserted basis for detaining these Petitioners, let alone an adequate substitute for traditional habeas review.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>

            <text syncTime="97.312" offset="581429">Well, with respect, Mr. Chief Justice, what you ruled... as I understand what the plurality held in Hamdi was that so long as there was a process accompanying detention, that provided for meaningful notice of the factual grounds for detention, a meaningful opportunity to present evidence in response to that before a neutral tribunal with the assistance of counsel, that determination would certainly be entitled to substantial deference by a habeas court; and we don't dispute that.</text>

            <text syncTime="143.693" offset="766899">It... I think your decision in this case, the question... the principal question we think is presented by the case is whether or not the DTA review of the CSRT procedures that occurred in this case adequately substitute for the writ of habeas corpus.</text>

            <text syncTime="167.241" offset="861149">The D.C. Circuit, as I understand it, ruled that there was no access to habeas, end of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.014" offset="892182">So the D.C. Circuit never examined the procedure under the DTA, did it?</text>

            <text syncTime="181.501" offset="918200">The district court... the two district judges sitting in habeas went to the merits of the case, and Judge Green did evaluate the procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.589" offset="954458">The D.C. Circuit held that the Constitution, neither the Suspension Clause nor the Due Process Clause, applies to these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.612" offset="986641">And therefore it didn't reach the merits.</text>

            <text syncTime="220.959" offset="1075980">It certainly could do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.311" offset="1081413">But one of the principal... the principal guarantee of habeas corpus through the centuries has been a speedy... the remedy of speedy release for somebody who is unlawfully being held in executive detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.320" offset="1137420">These 37 men have been held in isolation for years, and it is manifest on the record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.193" offset="1180887">There's no doubt about how the CSRT has proceeded.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.728" offset="1195098">There is little doubt about the circumscribed nature of the D.C. Circuit's review.</text>

            <text syncTime="334.401" offset="1529779">I think... I don't think... I think it is appropriate for a habeas... if the Executive says we have detained this person, we believe this person is an enemy combatant who may be lawfully detained under the AUMF, we have an administrative process that is fair, that will... that will determine the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.131" offset="1612639">You should stay your hand to allow that procedure to occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.266" offset="1625178">Of course, that is appropriate, so long as the procedure is meaningful and speedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="376.144" offset="1696754">But do you concede that if these people had never been brought to the United States, if the facility were in, say, Germany, that these detainees would have no access to habeas, no access to our courts?</text>

            <text syncTime="398.624" offset="1786615">First of all, I think these people are in a place that is even... that is under even more complete control and jurisdiction of our national Executive than they would be in the Everglades, because there are no Federalism constraints here.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.251" offset="1845129">Our national government supplies the only law.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.386" offset="1857668">And if they were detained in Germany, the question would be A, are they being detained by the United States or by some multinational coalition force as was the case, for example, in Hirota.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.529" offset="1910226">B, are there other laws, or can they invoke the jurisdiction of another court?</text>
            <text syncTime="437.301" offset="1941364">And the answer to that question would depend upon the terms of our--</text>

            <text syncTime="441.270" offset="1957247">Who says that... let's consider first the basis on which the court of appeals decided this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.774" offset="1987235">They decided it... in Rasul, we had held that the habeas statute extended to Guantanamo, and that those people who had filed their suits before the statute, at least, could bring a suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.652" offset="2050765">Congress acted.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.752" offset="2055154">And enacted a new habeas statute which makes it very clear that the habeas statute, at least, does not apply to these people in Guantanamo.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.725" offset="2087023">Your assertion here is that there is a common law constitutional right of habeas corpus that does not depend upon any statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.263" offset="2125162">Do you have a single case in the 220 years of our country or, for that matter, in the five centuries of the English empire in which habeas was granted to an alien in a territory that was not under the sovereign control of either the United States or England.</text>

            <text syncTime="1590.631" offset="6554693">Whether that was how the question was met or not, what I read here in these different briefs is in 1759, Lord Mansfield, the case can issue... a writ of habeas corpus, no doubt the power could issue it where the place is under the subjection of the crown of England.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.093" offset="6628567">Then Lord Sellers in Mwenya said subjection is fully appropriate to the powers, that's habeas, irrespective of territorial sovereignty or dominion, in other words, non-technical.</text>

            <text syncTime="1689.694" offset="6950918">And if the writ never extended to American seamen on the high seas or out of the realm, there would have been no point in suspending it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2424.136" offset="9888649">One is that I think with respect to the Uigars, in particular, there was a problem with ordering release outright.</text>

            <text syncTime="2453.088" offset="10004528">But the fact is that the effectiveness of habeas jurisdiction, for example, in requiring new trials, and so on, depends upon the ultimate sanction, which is the authority of the court to let somebody go if the Government does not comply with a condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.148" offset="10060744">And the... the Government practice so far under the DTA seems quite contrary to that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2487.228" offset="10141096">And the All Writs Act is available to allow them to order release to protect their jurisdiction under the DTA.</text>

            <text syncTime="2630.171" offset="10712865">And if you compare what these detainees have under the DTA in terms of judicial review to what would have been available to them at common law in 1789, it is not even close.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.645" offset="10754765">This is the remarkable liberalization of the writ, not some retrenchment or suspension of the writ.</text>

            <text syncTime="2653.119" offset="10804607">The first, of course, is the geographical limits on the reach of the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.088" offset="10820489">The second, but equally important, is the line of authority that says that the writ was simply unavailable to prisoners of war.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.944" offset="10851941">And the third problem would be the well-established common law rule that you can't controvert the facts as set forth in the return.</text>

            <text syncTime="4504.242" offset="18209172">--Well, no, but I mean the question is, you know, in a different case, sure, there would be a different habeas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4509.030" offset="18228293">But we don't know sort of the answer as to what habeas looks like in the context of enemy combatants detained in a place like Guantanamo, and we suggest, based on our best reading of Hamdi that, if there was habeas jurisdiction now, that the proceeding that would unfold would not be the plenary habeas that is envisioned by Petitioners but would be a much more narrowly circumscribed habeas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4531.145" offset="18316692">I would also point out that, again, it's not just--</text>

            <text syncTime="4532.928" offset="18323901">On the point I made, I think that's critical to your argument that the substitute is adequate.</text>

            <text syncTime="4538.649" offset="18346785">--I think that's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4540.334" offset="18353472">I would say, though, that our only baseline is not 1789 because, as we read this Court's decision in Rasul, Rasul is based on the predicate that until 1973 and Braden's overruling of Ahrens, that the habeas statute would not have gone to Guantanamo.</text>
            <text syncTime="4556.176" offset="18416897">And unless this Court is willing to say that there was an inchoate Suspension Clause violation until 1973 when Braden comes along, it seems like the tradition in this country too, based on the immediate custodian rule and the territorial jurisdiction of the courts, was that habeas in Guantanamo is a novelty.</text>
            <text syncTime="4572.305" offset="18481367">It's... 1973 at best.</text>
            <text syncTime="4574.255" offset="18489204">If I could finish with just bringing the Court's attention to one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4577.024" offset="18500280">This is in an amicus brief that is in support of us, the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4582.094" offset="18520551">But there's sufficiently little precedence for the Court to rely on, and I want the Court to have this: The Schiever case, which is one of the prisoner-of-war cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4589.248" offset="18549181">There's not... in the Rasul case, Justice Stevens, and the parties, we both cited to volume 97 of English Reporter and the report of the case by Burrow... there is in the English Reports an alternative report of that case, from Kenyon.</text>
            <text syncTime="4603.507" offset="18606233">And the report of that case which is 96 English Reports 1249 is actually longer on the law, shorter on the facts, but longer on the law than the report by Lord Burrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="4615.899" offset="18655761">So I wanted the court to have that available to them.</text>

            <text syncTime="4622.655" offset="18682824">I want to speak mostly about the adequacy of the substitute and particularly the question that you and Justice Kennedy asked about adjudication of the standard on remand, but just to take first things first, I don't... I don't believe I've ever seen the government's... the case Liverridge or Green cases cited by the government before.</text>
            <text syncTime="4642.849" offset="18763594">And I don't know what they say.</text>
            <text syncTime="4644.518" offset="18770177">But it is absolutely incorrect that DTA review of the CSRTs is a liberalization of the traditional writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="4653.607" offset="18806540">As this Court made... or the King's Bench made clear in the Bushell's case and all of the commentators including Sharpe, who both sides are citing as authoritative, here agree in cases of executive detention, where there wasn't a trial occurring, the court absolutely could... the prisoner could controvert the facts of the return in Schiever and Spanish Citizens... Spanish Prisoners, there wasn't an original hearing because the court issued... sat as nisi prius court and considered affidavits of the prisoners and third parties and determined on the basis of the affidavits that they were prisoners of war.</text>
            <text syncTime="4696.869" offset="18979679">But it is absolutely clear that the writ did extend to the question of</text>
            <text syncTime="4702.005" offset="19000159">"I am not a combatant. "</text>
            <text syncTime="4704.540" offset="19010295">"I am not a warrior, number one. "</text>
            <text syncTime="4708.177" offset="19024819">"And number two, it did go in non-criminal detentions to the underlying facts of the detention, and that goes to the point about the standard that Justice Kennedy asked and the Chief Justice asked. "</text>
            <text syncTime="4721.485" offset="19078109">"We agree that, if and when the D.C. Circuit ever addresses the merits of these cases, and not only is there no CSR... complete record on return in any case, but the government has suggested they proceed five at a time, and we're now two years running without a single one... but there's no doubt that the argument we're making in Roman numeral 2 of our brief, that the CSR, the Wolfowitz definition is not authorized detention under the AUMF, which as this Court in Hamdi said, incorporates long-established law-of-war principles and American traditions. "</text>
            <text syncTime="4763.828" offset="19247487">"We can raise that claim because they have to establish that the procedures and standards were consistent not only with the Constitution but also with the laws of the United States. "</text>

Circuit is... has already said it will not hear any new evidence and it must apply that same presumption that that evidence that was heard ex parte in camera with its own presumption is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="4840.162" offset="19552806">And here's... let me just give you an example of what difference this makes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4845.466" offset="19574017">You have the unredacted version of Judge Green's district court opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4850.553" offset="19594393">I don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="4851.653" offset="19598781">She discusses... she does address the adequacy of the substitute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4856.189" offset="19616858">And she addresses the case of two individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="4859.225" offset="19629083">One is Mr. Ait-Idir, who is my client, and you have both in her opinion and our brief this truly Kafka-esque colloquy at his hearing in which he is accused of associating with a known Al-Qaeda operative, which he denies, but he can't be told the name.</text>
            <text syncTime="4877.870" offset="19703585">Mr. Kurnaz is the other Petitioner who is discussed in her brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4882.841" offset="19723542">He was a Petitioner in this Court, but he has since been released by the government because of the fact that he had what the CSRTs won't give him, which is a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4894.398" offset="19769727">He was told, two years after he was detained... he's a German permanent resident... he was told at his CSRT, as many of these individuals were not, that he was being held because he associated with a known terrorist.</text>
            <text syncTime="4907.722" offset="19823016">And he was told the name.</text>
            <text syncTime="4910.091" offset="19832525">He was told that he associated with somebody called Selcook Bilgen who, the government contended, was (a) a terrorist, who was... had blown himself up while Mr. Kurnaz was in detention... may I simply finish this account... while he was in detention and in a suicide bombing; and all that Mr. Kurnaz could say at his CSRT where he had no lawyer and had no access to information was I never had any reason to suspect he was a terrorist.</text>
            <text syncTime="4946.097" offset="19976512">Well, when the government, in the habeas proceedings, filed its factual return in Judge Green's court, it filed as its factual return the CSRT record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4958.489" offset="20026145">His counsel saw that accusation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4962.876" offset="20043699">Within 24 hours, his counsel had affidavits not only from the German prosecutor but from the supposedly deceased Mr. Bilgen, who is a resident of Dresden never involved in terrorism and fully getting on with his life.</text>
            <text syncTime="4980.937" offset="20115901">That's what... and that evidence would not have been allowed in under DTA review.</text>
            <text syncTime="4988.191" offset="20144949">It wouldn't have been in the CSRT, and it won't come in under DTA review.</text>
