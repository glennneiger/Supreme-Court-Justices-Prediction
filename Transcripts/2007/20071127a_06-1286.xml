            <text syncTime="10.481" offset="209405">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question in this case is the meaning of a statute that provides that, in arriving at a trust or estate's adjusted gross income, amounts are allowable in full if they are... and I quote here from 26 U.S.C. section 67(e), which you can find at the bottom of page 3a of the appendix to the blue brief...</text>
            <text syncTime="34.112" offset="303864">"costs which are paid or incurred in connection with the administration of the estate or trust and which would not have been incurred if the property were not held in such trust or estate. "</text>
            <text syncTime="45.389" offset="349004">I'd like to make three broad points.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.528" offset="357572">First, when one applies the judicial tools of statutory interpretation, the statute can mean only one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.010" offset="387456">Second, "would not" does not mean "could not".</text>
            <text syncTime="59.289" offset="404592">The Commissioner's current reading of the statute and the Commissioner's previous readings of the statute are wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.474" offset="425386">Indeed, the logic of the Commissioner's position supports us.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.036" offset="439596">It acknowledges the distinctive nature of trusts and fiduciary obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.455" offset="457255">Finally, our reading makes sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.314" offset="468749">It is consistent with the treatment of trusts and estates elsewhere in the Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.375" offset="484945">It puts in place an administrable rule that draws a clear line, and by contrast the Commissioner has provided no reason at all why Congress would have wanted to subject the fees at issue here to the 2 percent floor.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="91.636" offset="533951">I think those three points are certainly what would help me.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.400" offset="549102">Could I ask just two preliminary questions?</text>
            <text syncTime="97.619" offset="557879">They don't necessarily have to do with this case, just to get something straight.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.227" offset="568328">I take it that you couldn't have claimed this deduction under 162 without getting into an argument that it should be capitalized and that's why 212 is in the Code?</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter J. Rubin</label>
            <text syncTime="110.721" offset="610333">Well, 212 and 162 are really sort of two sides of the same coin.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.468" offset="641366">162 is for costs incurred in a trade or business, and there's no... the trust isn't engaged in a trade or business any more than an individual who invests for the protection of property is in a trade or business.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.618" offset="701970">212, by contrast... and the text of 212 can be found in the governor's... the government's brief appendix at 5a... 212 is about expenditures for the preservation of property and for income in that context.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.923" offset="775113">So that's why this is a 212, not a 162.</text>

            <text syncTime="155.937" offset="791205">Perhaps I should ask the government.</text>

            <text syncTime="179.507" offset="885454">We think that... well, there are really two things built into your question, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.926" offset="911159">First is the question of who bears the burden of proof in tax cases specifically, and as this court has made clear, this was litigated below on a slightly different theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.249" offset="952432">The government's theory has changed during the pendency of the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.591" offset="969778">And below they argued that this was a common expense for individuals; yet they introduced no evidence of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.996" offset="995482">And under the United States v. Janis, this Court's decision in that case, they can't... the government is required to come forward with something before assessing tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="265.832" offset="1230793">Do you mean all people?</text>
            <text syncTime="268.268" offset="1240511">Is it common among everyone, among taxpayers, among taxpayers with certain assets?</text>
            <text syncTime="271.439" offset="1253258">Would a $100,000 trust have to be treated differently than a million dollar trust?</text>
            <text syncTime="275.812" offset="1270708">Then there's the question of what do you mean by "common".</text>

            <text syncTime="282.980" offset="1299338">And then ultimately there would have to be a trial somewhere to determine whether costs like this are indeed common to whatever standard was articulated.</text>

            <text syncTime="305.814" offset="1390663">In other words, if your investment advisor charges you $50,000 and, you know, 10,000 of it is unique to the trust, but 40,000 is the same sort of advice he'd give an individual, you'd only be able to get the 10,000 outside of the 2 percent limit?</text>

            <text syncTime="440.198" offset="1928263">It would be subject to the 2 percent floor from the individual who incurred it, and it would have been incurred, which is the language of the statute, whether or not--</text>

            <text syncTime="1048.611" offset="4361934">And I think this is why, if you look at the structure of Section 67, which treats pass-through entities but not trusts and estates as presenting a risk of income-splitting; if you look at the Code more broadly, which permits deductions by trusts and estates in many circumstances... section 68 does; section 154 does... when they're not permitted by individuals and especially when you look at the statutory history here... Both houses of Congress... well, this was preexisting law, I should begin by saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.927" offset="4483143">And then both houses of Congress passed in the '86 Act this statute without the second clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="1084.534" offset="4505608">I've read the legislative history, which shows to me, anyway, precisely no light whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.077" offset="4547717">It's... the only relevant sentence, which is the third sentence, simply repeats the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.950" offset="4567257">And, therefore, I thought that what Congress is trying to do is say, treat trusts like individuals, except in respect to special expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.851" offset="4614904">What are special expenses?</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.038" offset="4623577">Those that are related to the trust and that an individual wouldn't have occurred... incurred.</text>

            <text syncTime="1123.175" offset="4660148">But I have an absolutely clear idea what it means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.565" offset="4665686">To me it means that if this is an expense that the trust is saying is special, I would say, would a reasonable person who did not hold these assets in trust, would such a person be likely to make that kind of expenditure?</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.106" offset="4739874">And if the answer to that question is yes, well, then I would say it's not a special expense.</text>

            <text syncTime="1179.668" offset="4886160">To begin with, the statute doesn't ask what usually happens on the outside or commonly or customarily, and indeed the Commissioner has abandoned this reading of the statute precisely because it presents the kind of imponderables that I was discussing with the Chief Justice: What is usually done?</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.268" offset="4972573">Do trusts of different sizes have different rules?</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.549" offset="4981663">When a trust's assets come below a certain point, what about that?</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.500" offset="5001412">And most importantly, it's not in the text of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1215.872" offset="5030983">And if you look at the examples that she gives on page 23 of her brief of what it is that, that is deductible in full, it's the same as this: Fiduciary income tax preparation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.899" offset="5079048">Well, people... many people get income tax preparation for individual income tax returns.</text>
