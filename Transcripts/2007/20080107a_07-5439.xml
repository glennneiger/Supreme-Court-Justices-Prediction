            <text syncTime="2819.097" offset="11445861">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Petitioners ask this Court to invalidate a method of execution that everyone agrees is entirely pain free when followed and to order the State of Kentucky to adopt a method that has never been used in any execution and is out of step with the laws and practice in every death penalty jurisdiction in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.338" offset="11530811">The proposed constitutional standard that Petitioners say requires this extraordinary result has several fundamental flaws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.336" offset="11562785">First, it is at odds with this Court's precedence establishing a substantial risk threshold for claims of future injury in the Eighth Amendment context and this Court's cases holding that the added anguish caused by the negligent, accidental or inadvertent infliction of pain is not the unnecessary infliction of pain prescribed by the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.512" offset="11659542">Justice Marshall wrote that for the Court in the Estelle v. Gamble opinion on page 105, and this Court has reiterated the principle that negligent, accidental or inadvertent infliction of pain, however strong or anguishing, is not proscribed by the Eighth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2913.418" offset="11823173">We are here today in this Section 1983 action, because this Court and the Hill case and the Nelson case analogized methods of execution claims to conditions of confinement claims insofar as these claims are not directed to the punishment itself, but to the manner in which punishment is implemented or carried out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.410" offset="11907079">So this Court itself under the Hill and Nelson case put these types of cases into the conditions of confinement.</text>

            <text syncTime="2960.259" offset="12010524">The substantial risk standard that the Court has applied in the Farmer v. Brennan case and the Hiland v. McKinney case... applied to conditions of confinement claims... where inmates faced the risk of an excruciating pain or even death.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.362" offset="12074889">If the risk... if the standard that the Court applies to someone who is forced to spend... to live with a five pack a day smoker is substantial risk, even though that person faces the risk of developing lung cancer, which everybody would agree is excruciatingingly painful death they're not sure why the Constitution would place any different standard with respect to the types of claims at issue in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3090.625" offset="12531928">But to get into that kind of comparative inquiry, we do think that you have to get over the first threshold established by this Court's cases... that you're arguing about something other than the accidental or negligent infliction of pain, and we don't think Petitioners in this case have even gotten over that hurdle.</text>

            <text syncTime="3456.620" offset="13995934">The risk here is real that is why in the State of Kentucky it's unlawful to euthanize animals in the way that Kentucky carries out its executions that's true not only with the use of pancuronium, Kentucky also says one cannot use anything other than barbiturates, one cannot use potassium unless someone trained in ensuring effective anesthesia is participating in the process and what that is is a marker that this is a real danger sufficiently real that it's not tolerated with animals.</text>

            <text syncTime="3490.604" offset="14131875">But the anesthesia concern of course is you don't want to kill the person when you're administering just anesthesia in a surgery so you would want somebody trained there to ensure that you could bring them back if anything went wrong that concern is not present here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3505.832" offset="14192793">Nor is it present with respect to euthanizing animals and nevertheless it's the danger of the anesthesia going wrong there can be a torturous pain inflicted that has led veterinarians after careful consideration to say you have to have somebody in the process who is trained in monitoring anesthetic death and Justice Breyer if I could refer back to your Netherlands point my understanding is that in the Netherlands there is a doctor present who is trained in anesthesiology who administers this whole process and so the risk is dramatically different in a situation where you have that trained person there than the situation we have in Kentucky now with respect to the other states and the other so-called botched executions that my friend Mr. Englert referred to is just not right to say that they were all about cut downs and small problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.747" offset="14388502">The record finds a fact in the Morales case with respect to the 11 lethal injection studied there, there were evidence that six of the eleven were inadequately anesthetized from which one can readily infer they would have suffered grave pain... and indeed the state's expert in that case admitted it was likely that one of the eleven was not adequately anesthetized at the time that the pancuronium and potassium were put in the system... Similarly in the Brown case in North Carolina of the five lethal injections studied there the evidence credited by the district court was that with respect to four of them the condemned inmate was on the gurney gasping struggling not the kind of involuntary twitching that Mr. Englert is worried about but clear evidence that the anesthetic is not working... now with respect to the facts of this case... with respect to the lethality of thiopental at page 492 of the joint appendix Dr. Heath says that thiopental will be lethal by itself three grams at page 494 he says indeed it will be lethal by itself in virtually every case at two grams.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.092" offset="14657877">At page, at page forgive me I don't have the page number reference handy but Dr. Dershowitz the state's expert says the same thing now the reference that Mr. Englert referred to at page 499 is where Dr. Heath is being asked a question of well would you expect death to occur when three grams are administered but he is being asked a series of questions about administration in a surgical procedure which are using ventilators and other procedures to keep the person alive and he said in that setting the answer is no so that's just not a fair representation of the record at all now with respect to the question of whether we ought to analogize this to the deliberate indifference standard and convictions of confinement cases it seems to me there is a fundamental difference here which is that the Commonwealth of Kentucky is making a deliberate choice here.</text>
