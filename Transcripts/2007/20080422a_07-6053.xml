            <text syncTime="25.019" offset="260286">And, as we have shown in our briefs, the... California's forfeiture rule did not exist in common law.</text>

            <text syncTime="34.671" offset="298947">And the common-law concept that is embodied in the Confrontation Clause has grave, practical importance to defendants, and particularly to the defendant in this case, because the application of this new forfeiture rule that California created deprived the Petitioner of his right to present a fair claim of self-defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.802" offset="403437">Basically, the statement that was admitted accused the Petitioner of having viciously attacked Miss Avie and having threatened her at knifepoint and having threatened to kill her.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.873" offset="479714">And the admission of this statement, which he never had a chance to cross-examine or attempt a cross-examination, obviously was highly prejudicial because it indicated to the jury that he was planning to kill her.</text>

            <text syncTime="1597.033" offset="6548377">If the rule that you're announcing was the rule at common law, all of those would have come in because that declaration said this Defendant killed me.</text>

            <text syncTime="1656.680" offset="6786927">What happens in the dying declaration situation, Your Honor, is that there is no validation or vindication of the defendant's cross-examination rights; and that's what we are interested in here today: How the common law would have treated the cross-examination right of a defendant who killed a witness.</text>

            <text syncTime="1766.194" offset="7225053">Nevertheless, the common law puts some other nonconfrontation restrictions on the admissibility of the dying declaration.</text>

            <text syncTime="2963.390" offset="12013820">And I think it can come up in cases of... of abuse of children, as another example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.184" offset="12037017">So I think because there's no equitable argument on the part of the defendant about why this rule, this no-profit rule, would depend on an intent to tamper, I think if you transport that back into the common law, the same rule and the same principles of applying, and you would... you would have I think the same results.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.077" offset="12160524">Excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.680" offset="12218934">I think... again, well, I don't want to repeat myself, but I guess I just want to again emphasize that the... that the logic of the rule really doesn't admit of an intent requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.390" offset="12321752">Nothing in this Court's cases has ever dictated an intent requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.996" offset="12344217">Nothing in the common-law cases has ever articulated an intent requirement, and in the common-law cases the rule that we are advancing is justified by the maxim that applied at the common law, and it was also justified... well, at least I think an insight into how common law would have devalued the confrontation rights of the killer against the witness can be seen in the dying declarations case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.797" offset="12455394">Because even though they might ultimately have proved inadmissible on another ground, where the special criteria for the dying declaration cases was not met, those cases nevertheless are instances where the evidence comes in against the defendant where he kills the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.381" offset="12529791">The slayer's cases that were recognized at common law where no intent was required before somebody would be barred from receiving an inequitable distribution from an insurance policy, or from a testator, those cases were also decided at common law under this maxim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.921" offset="12619966">And the ultimate... I think the ultimate element to the analysis that proves dispositive is whether or not the defendant is benefitting from the wrongdoing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.851" offset="12671688">My opponent says that there's no benefit from the wrongdoing unless there is an intent to commit the wrongdoing in the first place, but that's palpably not so because you... because you have the benefit if you have the benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.209" offset="12721112">And to the extent that there is... an intent requirement might be perceived as necessary to provide some level of moral blameworthiness in terms of exploiting the wrongdoing, that exploitation occurs in any event when the defendant seeks to take advantage of the wrongdoing by making the objection and, as in this case, exploiting it even further at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.275" offset="12813376">So the equities of the situation... there's no, I think, personal equity that weighs in the balance on the basis of... in... on the side of keeping... keeping the evidence out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.895" offset="12879832">Where there is the wrongdoing and the causation and the profit from the wrongdoing, the statement should come out... should be admitted without regard to the mental state of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.500" offset="12926225">And on that I'll submit.</text>

            <text syncTime="3194.109" offset="12936674">--Thank you, Counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.622" offset="12942735">Ms. Burkhardt, you have four minutes remaining.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Ms. Marilyn G. Burkhardt</label>
            <text syncTime="3198.745" offset="12955169">It State said that there is no equity on the side... on Petitioner's side, and that's simply not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.131" offset="13000727">The statement is a testimony statement; under Crawford, it clearly must be excluded; and for the reason that it is... you know, he has been deprived of his right to test the accuracy of that statement and to expose its falsity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.711" offset="13095081">He claims the statement isn't true; and under Crawford, the... the Framers have prescribed a categorical procedural rule for testing whether a statement is reliable, and that's the right to confrontation; and he was deprived of that right and this in turn derived him of fair... of a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.003" offset="13180240">Now, the Framers in adopting the Confrontation Clause understood its parameters to include certain narrow exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.826" offset="13219528">And the exception... one of the exceptions was a witness tampering exception; and that had a very rational basis, because what it meant, in essence, is if the defendant is going to act against the criminal trial system from which he demands and requires justice, he cannot at the same time intentionally, deliberately manipulate and thwart the criminal justice system by preventing the appearance of... of necessary witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.358" offset="13353693">So in that case, when he does something of... to that effect, then it's fair, it's equitable and reasonable; he cannot profit from his own wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.059" offset="13392459">And that maxim that a person cannot profit from his own wrong was meant to apply to that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.618" offset="13418686">It wasn't meant to apply in the broad, generalized, amorphous sense that the State suggests, because that would effectively substitute in some sort of amorphous notions for reliability of... I'm sorry, fairness... for the amorphous notions of reliability standard that this Court just rejected by overruling Roberts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.655" offset="13514816">In fact, what's happened here is the State is attempting to resuscitate Roberts and to eviscerate Crawford; and it is no accident that this whole issue arose after Crawford.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.709" offset="13579078">This is a post-Crawford invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.147" offset="13588795">It did not even exist before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.303" offset="13597468">And it's not... the ink on Crawford was barely dry before the Supreme Court of Kansas, like six weeks later, enacted this... this first forfeiture-by-causation rule; and then a number of States such as California followed, and they all cite each other as authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.904" offset="13679806">But nothing before, because nothing before existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.792" offset="13695375">And when this Court in Crawford said we accept the rule of forfeiture by wrongdoing, we submit that the Court couldn't possibly have meant this broad standard that California created, because it did not exist at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.925" offset="13755979">We suggest that what this Court meant, as it indicated in Davis, is the... essentially the Federal rule entitled forfeiture by wrongdoing, which is specifically directed to witness tampering.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.061" offset="13804462">And that said... and codifies, as this Court said in Davis, the doctrine of forfeiture that has existed at the common law; that was... that has been understood for hundreds of years, that was carried forward and preserved in Reynolds, and then it was further carried forward to the Federal rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.660" offset="13898921">That's all we want.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.600" offset="13902682">We want the rule as it has always existed, not some new expanded rule that the... California has just created to undermine and eviscerate my client's rights to confrontation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.516" offset="13962346">We are just asking for a fair trial, which he did not get.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.639" offset="13974780">And the notion that he is profiting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.108" offset="13984707">Well, in that sense, everyone profits from the Confrontation Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.059" offset="14000485">It was designed to protect defendants from encroachment on the State.</text>
