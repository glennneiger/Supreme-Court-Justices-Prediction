            <text syncTime="19.775" offset="246804">And speech that falsely proposes an unlawful transaction is likewise unprotected.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.974" offset="271568">The statute at issue here properly construed does no more than prohibit efforts to offer or solicit materials that are contraband and then prevents somebody from turning around after soliciting or offering contraband and suggesting that the materials either did not exist or were not contraband after all.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.372" offset="349099">The statute does not prohibit truthful speech about lawful materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.247" offset="368639">Accordingly, the court of appeals erred in striking the statute down on its face.</text>

            <text syncTime="54.869" offset="387134">But if I could start with one of the more compelling hypotheticals on the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.695" offset="406464">Let's say I'm a movie reviewer.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.867" offset="415137">I write a review saying this is an awful movie.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.584" offset="426004">It portrays child pornography.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.675" offset="442304">Aren't I presenting information in a way that would cause others to believe that the movie contains child pornography, and wouldn't that be covered by the statute?</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="80.358" offset="489116">Mr. Chief Justice, we do not think that would be covered by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.014" offset="503744">We don't think that that would involve... in the first point, we don't think it would involve presentation or promotion of the movie in the meaning of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.947" offset="535405">We think those terms are really limited to efforts to make the product available to the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.337" offset="552959">And I think if you read those terms in conjunction with each other, they are all directed at efforts to make the product available to the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.410" offset="585246">Now, so if the person whose actually distributing the film wants to try to market it as actual child pornography, then I suppose that would come within the ambit of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.798" offset="622863">But a movie reviewer does not have anything to worry about in the first instance because I don't think that would come within the term--</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="120.342" offset="648985">Suppose the distributor attaches the movie review.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.060" offset="655881">It's in [amazonDOTcom,] and then it has the movie review.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="126.153" offset="672286">--Again, Justice Kennedy, it might be conceptually possible for somebody to market, let's say a mainstream movie, on the basis of a... either their own statement or an attached review, that misrepresents the nature of the movie and makes a claim for the movie, that it's actual child pornography.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.677" offset="746369">I suppose in that unusual circumstance, it would be covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.408" offset="761312">But I guess it would be equally possible for somebody to take one of the countless mainstream movies that portrays a murder on screen, and say this is actually a snuff film.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.390" offset="797256">There's actually... this was a snuff film.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.280" offset="804779">This was an actual murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.701" offset="810422">Now, somebody who did that would be clearly misrepresenting the film.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.324" offset="824946">I don't think they would turn around if somebody tried to do something about that false or misleading speech and be able to defend on that speech because it would be clearly false and misleading speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.836" offset="871026">And I think what is important here is if the underlying movie is not child pornography, then truthful efforts to promote that movie won't be captured.</text>

            <text syncTime="195.671" offset="950334">And so it comes within the literal terms of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="312.639" offset="1418239">It talks about artistic value, but this... there were several examples given in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.823" offset="1462961">One was this film depicts 12 year old child having sexual relations with an old man.</text>

            <text syncTime="369.102" offset="1644041">What I would say is this statute in order to apply, at least the way we interpret it, requires both an objective and a subjective component.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.379" offset="1673194">And so you would have to have a situation where that promotion of the movie objectively would lead somebody to believe that you're marketing in a manner that portrays it as actual child pornography.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.545" offset="1721782">Now I think what you've just said right there would probably fail at the objective test because I think particularly when you start talking about it being a motion picture and the like, the natural assumption... let's say it's a mainstream motion picture, is going to be oh, that's just actors, it's probably adult actors, or a body double or something.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.867" offset="1787088">I don't think that comes within the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.867" offset="1795134">The other thing that's required, of course, is a subjective component... specific intent is the way that we would read the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.395" offset="1821256">And clearly the person who's marketing Lolita itself and wants people to go see it in a mainstream box office does not have the intent to convey to people that this is actual, forbidden child pornography.</text>
