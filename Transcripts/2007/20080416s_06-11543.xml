            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104582">There is an act called the Armed Career Criminal Act which involves a person who has been convicted of unlawfully possessing a firearm, a gun with -- because he has previously been a felon.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.895" offset="160066">But the Act says, convicted of that, if a person is convicted of that and has three earlier convictions for a certain drug crimes or violent felonies, then there's a special mandatory minimum prison term of 15 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.082" offset="232895">And the question here is we look at the definition of those prior convictions and we say he's driving under the influence of alcohol, one of those crimes that triggers the special 15-year sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.063" offset="288798">Now the ones that trigger the 15-year sentence, they a have to have a prison term themselves of more than a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.913" offset="312203">Well, driving under the influence has that kind of prison term attached to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.280" offset="333624">It also has to have either as an element, the use of force against somebody, while driving under the influence doesn't have that.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.906" offset="368105">Or, it has to satisfy a certain special definition in a kind of property type provision, and that's what's at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.722" offset="411469">Does it or does it not fall within that special definition?</text>
            <text syncTime="80.867" offset="427978">Well, what is that definition?</text>
            <text syncTime="83.300" offset="437695">The crimes that satisfy those definitions, and crime satisfies that if the crime “is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves the use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.”</text>
            <text syncTime="102.851" offset="515958">Well, driving under the influence is a dangerous crime, and it does risk a serious harm to another so we assume it presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.730" offset="567472">But still, that provision lists four examples, namely burglary, arson, extortion, and explosives.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.182" offset="601222">And we conclude that driving under the influence of alcohol is so different from those examples, that Congress did not intend this statute to apply to driving under the influence.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.350" offset="653885">Now how is it different?</text>
            <text syncTime="139.260" offset="661617">Well, the listed crimes typically involve purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct, but the drunk-driving statutes normally do not insist on purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct and so they are comparable to, or nearly comparable to crimes that impose strict liability which criminalize conduct in respect to which the offender need not have had a criminal intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.252" offset="773526">Now, when we look at the Act's basic purpose, we think that difference which sounds a little technical matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.547" offset="802678">The Act's title says, think of it, the Armed Career Criminal Act and we used to think it focuses upon a special danger created when a particular type of offender, a violent criminal, or a drug trafficker possesses a gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.653" offset="875194">For example, the special danger that such a person, if he possesses a gun might deliberately point the gun and pull the trigger.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.935" offset="912288">A history of burglary, arson, extortion, and explosives doe tend to show that the offender is that kind of person.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.725" offset="951472">But a history of drunken driving while it certainly could indicate the person is a person of very serious, even unforgivable carelessness does not tend to show that he is that kind of person, a person who poses that kind, a special gun-related arm career criminal risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.675" offset="1031198">So Congress, we think did not intend to impose a 15-year mandatory prison term in that kind of instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.992" offset="1068500">For these reasons and for others set forth in our opinion, we conclude that the crime of driving under the influence of alcohol falls outside the scope of the Armed Career Criminal Acts violent felony definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.238" offset="1125447">The 15-year special term does not apply and we reverse the contrary conclusion of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.005" offset="1152510">Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.903" offset="1168184">Justice Alito has filed a dissenting opinion which Justices Thomas and Souter have joined.</text>
