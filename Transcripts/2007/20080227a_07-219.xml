            <text syncTime="28.317" offset="310075">The only remaining aspect... the only aspect of the litigation over the Valdez disaster that is before the Court today concerns almost entirely lost revenues by the commercial fishing industry.</text>

            <text syncTime="1011.864" offset="4244220">The answer to that question is: Yes, the jury could have found that Exxon was reckless in allowing Hazelwood to command the ship and that that recklessness would implicate the company for punitive damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="1032.462" offset="4326558">The Ninth Circuit said that the jury could also, in the alternative, have found that Exxon followed a reasonable policy of fostering reporting and treatment by alcohol abusers, knew that Hazelwood had obtained treatment, and did not know that he was taking command of the ship drunk.</text>

            <text syncTime="1397.361" offset="5786176">This Court itself has never affirmed an award of punitive damages under maritime law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2447.936" offset="9988547">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Each of the three rulings at issue here rests firmly in the mainstream of American tort law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.776" offset="10019894">And there is no reason in maritime jurisprudence to depart from those rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.478" offset="10034627">I want to start with the first question presented, what Exxon calls the vicarious liability issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.464" offset="10058659">And I think it's important to frame the discussion by starting with the actual jury instruction that's at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.118" offset="10081229">It's at Pet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.903" offset="10084364">App. 301a.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.387" offset="10090320">It says that a managerial agent is someone who supervises other employees and has responsibility for, and authority over, particular aspects of a corporation's business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.828" offset="10136086">And, as Justice Ginsburg noted, Exxon has never disputed that Captain Hazelwood satisfied this definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.199" offset="10157507">As its own internal documents explain, Captain Hazelwood was in charge of what they called a business unit of Exxon Shipping.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.436" offset="10186450">He was in charge of hundreds of millions of dollars of equipment, of product; he was in charge of budgeting and personnel with respect to the vessel; he was also in charge of safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.826" offset="10228037">He was the person who decided on behalf of Exxon that it was safe to leave port the night of March 23, 1989.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.730" offset="10259698">Now, it is our submission that it is perfectly appropriate to expose the corporation to punitive damages based on the reckless acts of such an individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.336" offset="10290104">In doing so, it does not, as Exxon would contend, impose vicarious liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.074" offset="10309017">Rather, what it does is it exposes a corporation to liability based on its own culpability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.209" offset="10329601">The very point of the restatement test, as opposed to the vicarious liability rule that is followed by the majority of the States, is that it requires some complicity on the part of the corporation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2772.279" offset="11285892">And, therefore, the way we do it is we require a jury to find at least a managerial agent.</text>

            <text syncTime="2957.001" offset="12024739">As I read Lake Shore, it seemed to me my first reading of it that it picked up this distinction that Justice Story made, and it said quite right, you could impute punitives or exemplary damages to a corporation where its managerial official is the one who causes... who behaves recklessly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.716" offset="12119616">But wait, we don't mean quite that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.485" offset="12130692">We mean some managerial officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.437" offset="12142499">And they seem to refer in the admiralty case, I'll tell you one who he isn't, namely, the ship's captain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.124" offset="12173219">He's not in that category.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.426" offset="12178444">And then in this other case, they say... they talk about a superintending agent authorized to imply, employ, and discharge the conductor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.082" offset="12221076">And they give that as an example of a managerial official where there would not be exemplary damages assessed against the corporation in light of his conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.158" offset="12269350">So when I read that, I thought that this Lake Shore case is just picking up the earlier case; and that's the Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.328" offset="12302055">And you've given the examples where the State law has changed; and I have no doubt you are right.</text>

            <text syncTime="3034.534" offset="12334865">But is there an example where I could say that the Federal law has changed, too?</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.338" offset="12362137">And you started down that track, but the reason this is of probably more than inordinate concern to me is that I wrote the case in Sand, I wrote a dissent in Legion, I looked into stare decisis law and made fairly clear views of what it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.937" offset="12448550">So what would you say to someone who has accepted certain legal principles that we have had in prior cases?</text>

            <text syncTime="3074.995" offset="12496720">--Three reasons, Justice Breyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.245" offset="12501735">The first is with all due respect, Amiable Nancy did not involve the wrongdoing of the captain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.415" offset="12526395">It involved the wrongdoing of a lower officer on the ship; and so it's... there's nothing in the Amiable Nancy that deals with captains, so you don't have a stare decisis effect that comes from Amiable Nancy with respect to captains.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.040" offset="12572893">The second thing is there are some more recent Federal cases that discuss the Lake Shore managerial agent idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.062" offset="12604971">We've cited them in our... in our red brief along through... I'm flipping now... but there are RICO cases; there are other cases, and Mr. Dellinger said, where statutory case... statutory regimes need to be implemented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.857" offset="12672158">And we have cited several lower court decisions that look to the managerial agent rule to do that, none of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.344" offset="12698176">The third thing is to understand, as you talked about in Lake Shore, you are having to pick somebody, and the general idea is higher up is okay, and way down low is not okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.235" offset="12745719">Fletcher in his Cyclopedia on corporations says that if the Lake Shore idea is to make sense today, you have to understand that when you're dealing with humongous corporations, you have to look not just to the president or vice president... and this is what the D.C. Circuit said in the GMAC case as well... is that when you deal with multinational corporations with tens of thousands of employees and divisions, you look to... you look a little bit lower down than those top job titles to managers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.886" offset="12860344">And so again this is what Professor Schoenbaum says in his amicus brief to this Court dealing with that from a maritime perspective.</text>

            <text syncTime="3828.664" offset="15511459">This Court has already addressed that concern in its collision doctrine, and tort law generally addresses the problem of dangerous activities and split second decisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="4426.596" offset="17903126">And we've spent the last decade or so of this Court dealing with the problem of how to set constitutional limits for awards which sort of by most people's standards verged on the excessive.</text>
            <text syncTime="4442.308" offset="17966029">The problem that we've had... we've had two problems in coming up with those constitutional standards: One is we can't simply substitute ourselves as lawmakers for the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="4689.863" offset="18956175">Now, I think Exxon's primary argument on deterrence grounds is that we've paid $3.4 billion out of our pocket already as a result of this spill, and that's a lot of money.</text>

            <text syncTime="4798.831" offset="19392106">In the criminal case, the statement of facts supporting the guilty plea in the criminal case... and remember, we're only talking about environment in the criminal case... and in terms of punishment, the only money for punishment in the criminal case is $25 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="4812.489" offset="19446754">All the rest of the money is, as the district court said, to clean up Exxon's mess or to put money into the environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4818.959" offset="19472563">Now, for $25 million fine that Exxon paid in the criminal case, the district judge explained... or I'm sorry, the district judge approved the statement that the U.S. attorney submitted, which said the basis for this is that the captain and the third mate were negligent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4833.282" offset="19529928">That was the only thing even there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4835.468" offset="19538601">It wasn't until our trial and our discovery that it was brought out that the complicity of the organization ran far deeper.</text>
            <text syncTime="4843.074" offset="19569007">And so at our... phase three of our trial, which was entirely about Exxon's conduct, not any more at all about Captain Hazelwood's conduct... in phase three of our trial we started out the closing argument by saying here's the relevant evidence for the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="4857.750" offset="19627730">And we played something for the jury called Trial Compilation 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="4860.619" offset="19639224">Now, that appears at appears at page 1295 of the joint appendix, and we actually submitted a videotape that we have submitted to the Clerk's office, and it is sitting in the Clerk's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="4869.142" offset="19673288">There are 50 segments in Trial Compilation 9, and all 50 deal with Exxon's upper management receiving reports of Hazelwood's conduct and deeming it a gross error to put him in command and so forth, all there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4882.365" offset="19726264">So it wasn't until the trial in our case that it came out how deep the complicity ran in the organization and how reprehensible the conduct was.</text>
            <text syncTime="4891.138" offset="19761268">And in reviewing the award the district judge said: Now, with that level of complicity and reprehensibility, I think the jury could have decided that Exxon should be punished for this--</text>

            <text syncTime="4924.427" offset="19894493">If you accept our argument in the first that to get in the door, all we had to show was that a managerial agent was reckless and that Captain Hazelwood, as Exxon conceded, Was a managerial agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4934.415" offset="19934408">When you are reviewing the size of the award... and I think we're talking about the third question presented, the size of the award... all the... all the evidentiary questions are resolved in favor of us, and certainly they are resolved in a way that conducting de novo reviews, a lower court understood and told this Court what the record was.</text>
            <text syncTime="4952.060" offset="20005043">And it is all about the three years that they knew Captain Hazelwood was drinking.</text>
            <text syncTime="4955.948" offset="20020508">But I don't want to leave Justice Kennedy's question about deterrence, because even if this Court looks at the payments Exxon has made from a perspective of deterrence, there are two legs in which Exxon has clearly not been deterred.</text>
            <text syncTime="4968.256" offset="20069827">The first is that Exxon's own executives testified to Congress shortly after the spill that the results of the spill were, quote, "pretty much as we envisioned".</text>
            <text syncTime="4978.044" offset="20108906">Now, it was also common knowledge in the organization, and this came out at trial, that the idea of putting a drunken master in charge of a supertanker was a potential for disaster and incalculably raised the chances of a disaster and a catastrophic spill occurring.</text>
            <text syncTime="4996.323" offset="20182049">Knowing all this; knowing what could happen; knowing that the industry did not have sufficient cleanup equipment to contain a big spill; knowing that tens of thousands of Alaskans that depended on Exxon taking proactive action, the kind of action that Congress had demanded in passing the TAPAA; Exxon nonetheless left Captain Hazelwood in command over a three year span.</text>
            <text syncTime="5017.502" offset="20266790">So it wasn't deterred by knowing what would happen if the tanker ran aground.</text>
            <text syncTime="5021.656" offset="20283404">Even if you look at it from the perspective of having paid the money out of its pocket, what did it do?</text>
            <text syncTime="5026.191" offset="20301481">It still hadn't been deterred.</text>
            <text syncTime="5028.060" offset="20309004">In the wake of the spill, and this is part of Trial Compilation 9, and this was part of the argument to the jury, Exxon fired one person... Captain Hazelwood.</text>
            <text syncTime="5036.582" offset="20343068">They reassigned the third mate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5039.132" offset="20353308">Everybody else up... further up the chain of command who allowed this to happen received bonuses and raises.</text>
            <text syncTime="5046.688" offset="20383505">They have taken no action inside the company to express in any meaningful way that they've been deterred by what happened in this incident--</text>

            <text syncTime="5117.765" offset="20667822">You have a single digit ratio which is proportionate to the harm that was shown in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5123.502" offset="20690810">You have... in contrast to State Farm, in the most recent... second most recent case this case had... in State Farm you had two plaintiffs who stood before this Court having received $500,000 each in compensatory damages for the emotional distress of 18 months of not knowing whether an insurance claim was going to be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="5142.564" offset="20766983">What you have today are 32,000 plaintiffs standing before this Court, each of whom have received only $15,000 for having their lives and livelihood destroyed and haven't received a dime of emotional distress damages.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="5155.973" offset="20820690">Thank you, Mr. Fisher.</text>
            <text syncTime="5157.556" offset="20826960">Mr. Dellinger, you have four and a half minutes.</text>

            <label>Mr. Walter E. Dellinger, III</label>
            <text syncTime="5161.275" offset="20841902">Let me begin by noting that it's... I do not think the Court will find in the record that Exxon said this was expected and approved the... you can look at that excerpt on the DVD and see for yourself what was... what was meant by that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5185.307" offset="20938032">With respect, it is difficult to decide what level of employee should implicate a company; but it is divisible I think, as Justice Kennedy suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="5197.633" offset="20987247">It is based on whether that employee has authority over the policy, and even a ship captain may have authority over some policies; he did not hear.</text>
            <text syncTime="5204.870" offset="21016191">At the end of the day what the Ninth Circuit held was that Exxon was liable... could be liable for 2.5 billion, simply because against its policies, Hazelwood left the deck.</text>
            <text syncTime="5216.178" offset="21061435">That's all that we need to be found.</text>
            <text syncTime="5218.028" offset="21068854">Now with respect to the... with respect to the amount of punitive damages here, where you are... punitive damages cases generally look to for the need to deter the activity where someone acts out of malice and hostility, intending to harm, which is not true here; or when a corporation acts out of a profit motive and hopes perhaps it will be concealed or that it will make enough money off of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5248.713" offset="21191629">That is not true here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5250.665" offset="21199466">Exxon gains nothing by what went wrong in this case, and paid dearly for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5257.569" offset="21227051">In the criminal case, the U.S. and Alaska agreed that the amount of the penalty was quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="5268.025" offset="21268847">"sufficient to provide punishment and deterrence for the conduct in question. "</text>
            <text syncTime="5272.328" offset="21286088">Now if you talk about the... the amount where you have that kind of deterrent, for an unintentional act that... of the amount that's already paid, I heard no response to what one would say to Justice Kennedy's opinion in State Farm as an outer, outer limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5289.707" offset="21355574">In State Farm the Court said where compensatory damages are substantial, then perhaps... this is the constitutional context... perhaps an amount equal to compensatories would be the most.</text>
            <text syncTime="5301.632" offset="21403326">What was substantial there was 1 million dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="5303.800" offset="21411998">The compensatories here were 400 or 500 times the... what the Ninth Circuit found... 504 million dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="5314.339" offset="21454108">Yes?</text>

            <text syncTime="5314.689" offset="21455466">Just as a class, if you take them individually, each individual, did Mr. Fisher say 15,000 something?</text>

            <text syncTime="5323.011" offset="21488798">Well, from the stand... first of all, from the stand point of a company it doesn't matter whether you pay one person 500 million dollars or a lot of people 500 million dollars, in terms of punishment and deterrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5332.951" offset="21528609">But also it is the case that... that with regard to the first plaintiff who had been fully compensated, the argument would have been that in light of all that happened, there is no need for punishment and deterrence even in the first case, and certainly cumulatively, when the amount ad reached, say the amount of the civil fines of 80 million, one would have said no more punitives, because the purpose of punitive damages is a public purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="5355.749" offset="21619724">It is not to compensate the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="5358.434" offset="21630486">Here we're at 500 times what was considered substantial in State Farm.</text>
            <text syncTime="5363.005" offset="21648772">I don't see... and what is that... that part of State Farm is to be considered a dead letter, how one could not see that this is the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5370.492" offset="21678761">But that... that amount of compensatories is an outer limit, because if you look to what the civil penalties would be that responsible officials have obtained, it is 80.2 million dollars; and when you look to the fact that this is a case where, as Justice Breyer notes, with the First Circuit opinion, outside the fishing context there would have been no compensatories paid at all, or owing, because it's consequential damages and in most States, the great majority of the States, that is not even a compensable... a compensable injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="5405.165" offset="21817419">But it is a special rule for... for fishing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5407.701" offset="21827554">So these are awards... that would not have been done in any case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5411.486" offset="21842705">This was a tragic and terrible event, and one for which the company has paid dearly, and the... at the end of the day, the question will be whether this Court without any guidance should assume that there should a punitive damages remedy in areas where Congress has already acted, and whether, if so, the plaintiffs have made out any case of an additional need for punishment and deterrence beyond what public authorities have agreed to.</text>
