            <text syncTime="8.670" offset="199032">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Derrick Kimbrough's case is about what a district court may consider when imposing sentence in conformity with Section 3553(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="24.180" offset="261099">That statute directs sentencing courts to do exactly what Judge Jackson did in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.516" offset="294431">He properly calculated and considered the advisory guideline range, the Sentencing Commission's reports, Mr. Kimbrough's personal history and background, and the offense itself, as directed by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.045" offset="356603">He then made case-specific findings to impose an appropriate sentence, and he did not make any categorical determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.067" offset="392652">The Fourth Circuit reversed, applying a per se rule prohibiting disagreement with the crack cocaine guideline.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.388" offset="425984">The government, on the other hand, argues that Congress has implicitly directed sentencing courts to adhere to the crack guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.195" offset="465168">Both of these positions are wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.997" offset="476348">With respect to the Fourth Circuit, the Fourth Circuit applied a rigid rule that prohibited any disagreement with the crack guideline, which is determined solely by drug type and quantity.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.305" offset="529638">They then prohibited the imposition of any sentence outside the guideline range, either above it or below it, unless the court identified facts specific to the defendant or the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.065" offset="584704">This ruling is inconsistent with the Court's holdings in Cunningham and Rita, which hold that the courts must be free to disagree with policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.605" offset="630784">Finally, the Fourth Circuit required that those facts be atypical, which mirrors the exact language that was excised in 3553(b)(1).</text>

            <text syncTime="135.167" offset="705076">Your Honor, Congress can certainly speak explicitly through its statutes to impose further refinements on the penalty structure that it set out in 841.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.475" offset="762337">Section 841, on its face, does no more than set mandatory minimums and maximums at two triggering quantities.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.865" offset="799848">If Congress wanted to specify further triggering quantities which would cabin the discretion of sentencing courts, they could do so, but they have not done so and there is no canon of statutory construction that the government identifies or that I'm aware of that would justify the notion of the implicit binding directive.</text>

            <text syncTime="179.177" offset="881142">If Congress made a finding that crack and cocaine are equally dangerous and passed a statute that said, for sentencing purposes, every district judge shall treat cases involving these two substances exactly the same, would there be a Sixth Amendment problem with that?</text>
            <text syncTime="198.007" offset="956374">Or do you think every district judge gets the right to make that policy decision individually?</text>

            <text syncTime="211.898" offset="1011963">But once they set a floor and a ceiling, pursuant to this Court's remedial holding in Booker, judges must be free to consider the entire range of punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.873" offset="1055848">And Booker relies on the notion that the Guidelines are now fully advisory and, therefore, judges without having to identify specific facts have to have the discretion to disagree with policies or identify things unique to the case in order to fashion an appropriate punishment.</text>

            <text syncTime="272.871" offset="1255842">There are several answers to that question, Justice Souter.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.507" offset="1270470">The first is that this Court has recognized with the same statute which has the same structure that the government argues can only logically be understood one way, that with regard to the weight for LSD in the case of Neal versus United States, it is perfectly appropriate for there to be two different methods of calculating weight for purposes of punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.789" offset="1359600">The Guidelines calculate weight based on a presumed weight of the combination of the LSD and the blotter paper or the carrier medium.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.895" offset="1395963">And the statute defines the method for calculating the mandatory minimum by the combined weight of the LSD and the blotter paper, regardless of whether it is heavy or whether it is light.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="320.702" offset="1447163">But is that an argument for saying, well, in the LSD case, you approved of incoherence and irrationality, therefore, you want to do it across the board?</text>
            <text syncTime="332.408" offset="1493974">I mean, there is still an argument here on the merits regardless of Neal that there is an incoherence between the minimum and the kind of discretion that you're talking about.</text>

            <text syncTime="345.234" offset="1545279">Well, Your Honor, I think what Neal reflects is that there's no implicit binding policy directive in 841 itself that requires either the Commission or sentencing courts to follow in lock step on a graduated proportionate scheme, whatever it is that Congress decided with respect to two specific triggers should be the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="383.359" offset="1697834">Yes, and Your Honor, if I could also point out that there really is a myth here with regard to the 100 to 1 ratio as it stands now and as the Commission created it in 1987.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.285" offset="1757497">The 100 to 1 ratio describes the relative weight of crack cocaine and powder cocaine with regard to the levels in the sentencing table; so that if you compare, for example, the 10-year mandatory minimum trigger, 50 grams of crack, that gets you to a level 32 in the sentencing table and it requires 5 kilos of powder cocaine or 5,000 grams.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.055" offset="1872645">That's the 100 to 1 ratio.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.505" offset="1878392">And it is true that if one compares the low end of that table... 5 kilos to 50 grams, you end up with the same punishment, or likewise, if you compare the top of the range, 15 kilos to a 150 grams.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.980" offset="1940355">But the way the guidelines have been written, there are a multitude of ratios that get applied right now and were applied in the pre-Booker guidelines scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.872" offset="1983927">In other words, 14.9 kilos of powder compared to 51 grams of crack results in a 292 to 1 ratio.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.144" offset="2028962">You get the exact same punishment, it is a level 32.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.632" offset="2042964">Likewise if you flip it, and you compare 149 grams of crack to 5 kilos of powder cocaine, you are still within a level 32, and it is a 34 to 1 ratio.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="482.355" offset="2093850">Maybe that was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.089" offset="2100746">Maybe the Sentencing Commission should have, in order to be faithful to the Congressional determination, should have done it quite proportionately.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.378" offset="2133870">I mean, I'm not hung up on what the Sentencing Commission said.</text>

            <text syncTime="502.650" offset="2175039">And of course, the Sentencing Commission taken to the ultimate extreme would have had to have a proportionate sentencing table by gram or fraction of a gram in order to preserve the 100 to 1 ratio, which simply points out in combination with Neal the fact that this was a choice made by the Commission, a choice, by the way, not grounded on any empirical evidence or any other reason other than what 841 originally indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.669" offset="2295097">It could have been done differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.371" offset="2301889">It is done differently with regard to other drugs in 841, such as LSD or such as marijuana plants, which have a different method for calculation under the Guidelines as they do for purposes of mandatory minimums.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.648" offset="2358941">And, of course, what that means is that there is no implicit directive, which is the only rational--</text>

            <text syncTime="586.335" offset="2509719">But Congress also did not at any time in Section 994, which is where it has given other explicit directions to the Commission to fashion guidelines in a particular way, say anything about how to fashion the punishment for crack cocaine or any of the other drugs in Section 841.</text>

            <text syncTime="1626.483" offset="6670294">I think this case may well be controlled by the decision in Neal against the United States, which is not cited in the government brief and wasn't cited in the blue brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="1654.919" offset="6784084">And, as I understand the facts of this case, the Commission has told us actually in some of its reports that the 100 to 1 ratio does produce unwarranted disparities.</text>

            <text syncTime="1825.724" offset="7467342">Let me start with a couple of points about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.926" offset="7480090">First of all, when the Commission promulgated the drug Guideline initially, it conformed it to the 100 to ratio that existed under the mandatory minimum sentencing statute, because it recognized... and these were the Commission's words... that a logical and coherent sentencing scheme required that there be consistent proportionality throughout the sentencing process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.608" offset="7566817">When the Commission later studied the crack-powder ratio and concluded that Congress had gotten it wrong and, therefore, the Commission, itself, had gotten it wrong by conforming to what Congress did, it proposed a Guideline that would have changed the ratio for Guideline's purposes only to one to one between crack and powder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.920" offset="7644035">And Congress, for the first time in the history of its review of Guidelines amendments, rejected that proposal; and it did so with legislation that made clear that it believed that if the commission wanted to come back with something new, it should propose something that would change both the Guidelines and the sentencing statutes so that they would continue to work in tandem... that it would preserve a higher ratio of punishment for crack than powder because it believed that crack was more serious, and that it believed that any ratio should apply consistently across the Guidelines and the statute.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael R. Dreeben</label>
            <text syncTime="3231.678" offset="13091088">Well, there are some other guidelines where Congress has directly intervened, but my fundamental point here is that so long as Congress has made a determination that it has not changed, that it wants 100 to 1 as a mandatory minimum set point, district courts should not be free to say I think Congress got it wrong, I'm going to sentence on a different paradigm.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.859" offset="13171858">The Commission didn't think that was appropriate when it promulgated the original drug guideline, which is why that guideline is not based on the same sorts of empirical data that other guidelines might be deemed to be responsive to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.249" offset="13225357">But that only reflected that the Commission in its original guideline respected that its role was to carry out congressional policy, not to disagree with or supplant congressional policy, and so long as the Commission was operating in that vein... which I think was correct... it follows a fortiori that sentencing courts should do the same thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="3286.413" offset="13310098">Does the Guidelines supersede the parsimony provision, because the parsimony provision is general and the Guidelines... the ratio is specific?</text>

            <text syncTime="3296.037" offset="13348550">Well, I would put it differently, Justice Kennedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.654" offset="13355029">I would say that Congress has made a legislative judgment that for crack purposes, this ratio is what is needed to have a sufficient sentence, and the Congress that decided that might be wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.278" offset="13405497">And if the present-day Congress decides to change that, a new policy will be established, but I think that reading the two statutes together, Section 3553(a) and Section 841, produces the conclusion that this is a legislative judgment of reasonableness; and even if every judge in the Federal system holds a different personal view, that doesn't mean that the statute has validated their position over the one that Congress expressed in Title 21, in a manner that binds sentencing courts irrespective of how the Commission sorts out its policy judgments.</text>

            <text syncTime="3355.076" offset="13584697">Well, I don't think that the Court can interpret Congress in Section 3553(a) to make unreasonable what Congress did in Section 841.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.634" offset="13630882">I think reading all of the statutes together would produce the conclusion that Congress deemed that this was the way to achieve the purposes of sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.990" offset="13668394">Crack is more corrosive in the inner cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.524" offset="13678529">It has different kinds of problems than powder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.310" offset="13689605">They should be addressed in this more severe sentencing manner, and if that's a policy judgment that warrants being revisited, the appropriate body to do it is Congress, not each individual sentencing judge, formulating his or her own ratio, subject to blanket affirmance by the court of appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="3407.092" offset="13792737">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.711" offset="13799215">If I can respond, Justice Stevens, I think... you asked about the percentage of cases in crack that are at the mandatory minimum or near it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.851" offset="13843832">I would point the Court to page 33, footnote 10 of our opening brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.070" offset="13864626">It is approximately 70 percent or just over that that hit at the mandatory minimum or just one or two levels above that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.926" offset="13900048">So the large majority of cases involving crack cocaine end up being subjected to the mandatory minimum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.932" offset="13932126">With regard to the Government's argument regarding Section 994(a) and the fact that direction was given to the Commission to be consistent with pertinent statutes, of course, that's reflected in Section 5(g) which says that mandatory minimums trump the Guidelines, and the Commission recognizes that and of course sentencing judges recognize that, and Judge Jackson recognized it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.713" offset="14031287">To suggest that Judge Jackson concluded that Congress was crazy, I think is unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.284" offset="14053543">What Judge Jackson did was, in a very reasoned opinion, explained that the information from the Sentencing Commission, which has been persuasive not just to Judge Jackson, but to judges across the country and to many others, was that the 100 to 1 ratio overstates the seriousness of the offense, and he understood that Congress had spoken clearly with regard to mandatory minimums, and he honored them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.102" offset="14160854">Finally, Mr. Chief Justice, you point out the heart of the problem with the Government's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.505" offset="14190425">Congress has not spoken explicitly in the way the Government suggests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.009" offset="14212472">They are--</text>

            <text syncTime="3512.778" offset="14215502">But I was wrong that they legislated after Booker.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael S. Nachmanoff</label>
            <text syncTime="3516.063" offset="14228668">--Well, Your Honor, Congress has failed completely to address this particular problem, and they have understood since Booker that if they wanted to address the issue of the discretion that sentencing courts must have with regard to the advisory guidelines, they have a way of fixing the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.477" offset="14314350">They can change the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.260" offset="14321455">And so long as they then require the Government to include in the indictment and prove to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt the specific drug type and drug quantity over and above the current mandatory minimum and maximums, they're free to do that, and there would no Sixth Amendment problem and there would no problem with the advisory guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.973" offset="14400240">In other words, right now, the Government simply alleges that a person engaged in the distribution of either 5 grams or 50 grams of crack cocaine... that's what they have to do to meet the thresholds for the 5-year and the 10-year mandatory minimums... in virtually every case the Government will present evidence or a court will find under relevant conduct that there was some greater quantity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.624" offset="14502849">And if the Government's theory were to be accepted, those guidelines would be mandatory, and it would be in direct conflict with the remedial holding in Booker to require courts to adhere to that, absent the procedural protections which are not currently in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.884" offset="14563976">Judge Jackson did it right in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.836" offset="14579754">He imposed a sentence consistent with the parsimony provision and the purposes of sentencing and all of the factors in 3553(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.692" offset="14615176">He imposed a long sentence, 15 years, but he honored Congress's explicit mandate, and we would ask the Court to reverse the court of appeals and affirm the district court.</text>
