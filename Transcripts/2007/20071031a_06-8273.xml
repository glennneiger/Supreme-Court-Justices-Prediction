            <text syncTime="2474.845" offset="10066631">And a lot of Teague says that should be the Federal rule, if it's called a Federal rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.827" offset="10086484">But then you said a different thing, in answer to Justice Stevens.</text>

            <text syncTime="2508.270" offset="10200274">Because on the metaphysics, as Justice Souter just pointed out, imagine three people who have three identical trials each one year before Crawford.</text>

            <text syncTime="2530.042" offset="10287418">And the third person is called Jones, and he get a quick appeal, convicted, in jail at the time of Crawford.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.179" offset="10323885">Now we know that the first two Crawford applies to, but metaphysically, if the law of Crawford was the law at the time of the first two trials, why wasn't it the law in terms of what the rights are in respect to the third person whose trial was held at precisely the same time?</text>

            <text syncTime="3545.367" offset="14348728">Let me ask you a question which is totally off the point of the Federal Constitution, I guess.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.442" offset="14376940">That is, if Minnesota really wants the rule that you want it to have, its legislature can provide that that will be the rule, can't it?</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.689" offset="14405988">The Minnesota legislature can pass a statute saying nobody gets more than Teague allows.</text>

            <text syncTime="3576.557" offset="14473488">Can the Minnesota legislature say: Look, the... the Supreme Court of the United States has... has come down with some rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.883" offset="14506716">We won't characterize them as minimums or anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.179" offset="14515911">We'll just say it's a set of rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.912" offset="14522912">It's called Teague, and Teague is going to be the law for the application of Federal rights in Minnesota State courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="3624.585" offset="14665541">Two quick points in my... in my one minute: On finality, the State court can weigh the costs and benefits of upsetting the finality of its own conviction, convictions rendered in State court and appeals rendered in State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.750" offset="14722174">It can decide, as several States have, that the interests in full adjudication of constitutional claims outweigh the interest in finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3646.950" offset="14754984">The question in Teague was whether the Federal court could decide that for the States, and the answer is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.995" offset="14775150">But the States can decide that for themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3654.370" offset="14784659">On Justice Souter's point about what... or somebody's point about what the source of authority was, Mr. Diamond said it was basic norms of constitutional adjudication, and that is the phrase used in Griffith.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.537" offset="14829381">That phrase is a minimum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.910" offset="14838889">The basic norms of constitutional adjudication require the following: They require application of new rules to pending cases, even though the conduct had already... had already happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="3679.267" offset="14884238">They don't require anything more than that, and we're not here asking the Court to hold that they do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.139" offset="14903777">We're simply asking the Court... I see my time is up.</text>
