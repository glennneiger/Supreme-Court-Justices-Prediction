            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104761">A common problem in litigation and this is discussed in this case which is 06-1204, a common problem of litigation is the question of which persons or entities must be joined in an action before the case can proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.598" offset="163066">And suppose there are persons who should be made parties, but who cannot be made to join, does this mean the case must be dismissed or may the litigation proceed without them?</text>
            <text syncTime="22.814" offset="195981">These questions of joinder in civil cases in federal court are addressed in Rule 19 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.029" offset="224820">In this case, it determines on -- turns on the interpretation of proper application of Rule 19 in the particular context of sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.692" offset="263481">This interpleader action was commenced to determine the ownership of property, the property was held by Merrill Lynch, it wanted to know who the owner was so it commenced this interpleader suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.318" offset="309979">It was property allegedly stolen by Ferdinand Marcos when he was President of the Republic of the Philippines.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.968" offset="340594">Alleged crimes and misfeasance by Marcos during his presidency became the subject of world wide attention and protest.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.947" offset="364523">A class action by and on behalf of over 9,000 of his human rights victims was filed against Marcos and his estate among others and that was filed in the United States courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.724" offset="407572">These parties are called the Pimentel class.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.630" offset="427217">The Pimentel class obtained a judgment for nearly $2 billion and the interpleader suit that the Pimentel class wants to execute on the property in question, property held by Merrill Lynch in partial satisfaction of that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.689" offset="483432">Two other entities were named in the interpleader suit and they invoked sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.255" offset="509763">Now, those entities were the Republic of the Philippines and the Philippine Presidential Commission on Good Governance and we refer to these in the opinion as the Republic and the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.202" offset="545499">They, too, claim a right to these assets and litigation on their claim is also pending in the Philippine courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.750" offset="571726">Now, the assets here in question here were last valued at about $35 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.633" offset="591265">In the early stages of the interpleaderâ€™s case, the Republic and the Commission were dismissed as parties, but the action proceeded without the sovereign entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.661" offset="631390">That interpleader action resulted in a ruling that the Pimentel class could levy on the assets and the Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.219" offset="661587">It held that under Rule 19, it was proper to allow the interpleader action to proceed even though the sovereign entities were not parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.498" offset="690740">In this Court, the Republic of the Philippines together with other petitioners who were parties to the suit claimed it was error to allow the action to go forward without the sovereign entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.804" offset="727938">In their view, once it was determined that the Republic and the Commission could not be joined, the action should have been dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.827" offset="756046">We agree and we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.933" offset="776421">There is an -- an initial question whether the sovereign entities are properly in this Court when they were dismissed from the suit in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.740" offset="811634">Other parties, however, who were in the suit and who appealed the judgment joined the sovereign entities as petitioners in the case now before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.861" offset="844131">We hope that they can pursue the matter, they can raise the objections made by the sovereign entities for if the interpleader action should not have continued then all of the petitioners here will be relieved of an adverse judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.308" offset="897943">Now, that brings us to the Rule 19 question.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.198" offset="909541">Now, the rule has various factors to be considered in determining whether an action can proceed without required persons and the opinion discusses these factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.886" offset="944232">Here it suffices to say that the first factor weighs heavily in favor of the Republic and the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.144" offset="965234">That factor considers the extent to which the absent entities are prejudiced by a judgment if the case proceeds without them.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.119" offset="1001179">The Court of Appeals found little or no prejudice to the Republic or to the Commission and in its view they would not prevail on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.823" offset="1032003">We conclude that whether or not the sovereign entities would prevail, their claim was not a frivolous one and it was error for the Court of Appeals to consider that claim when the sovereign entities were in the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.532" offset="1074844">But the Court of Appeals to make this ruling was itself a violation of the sovereign immunity that the Republic and the Commission assert.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.684" offset="1103474">The privilege of sovereign immunity is codified by statute and the comity and dignity interests that contributed to the development of the sovereign immunity privilege take concrete form in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.395" offset="1158332">The claims of the Republic and the Commission arise from events of historical and political significance for the Republic and its people.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.232" offset="1189679">The Republic and the Commission have a unique interest in resolving the ownership of or claims to the assets and in determining if and how the asset should be used to compensate those persons who suffered grievous injury under Marcos.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.081" offset="1245058">The other factors listed in the rule are either inapplicable or weigh as well in favor of the petitioners, we determine that this action must be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.326" offset="1277972">This leaves the Pimental class which has waited for years now to be compensated for grievous wrongs with no immediate way to recover on its judgment against Marcos and at least Merrill Lynch, the stakeholder who wants to know who should receive the assets without the -- without a judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.664" offset="1347354">The balance of equities may change in due course.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.712" offset="1359579">One relevant change may occur if it appears that the Philippines' Court cannot or will not issue its ruling within a reasonable period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.909" offset="1388314">Other changes could result when and if there is a ruling in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.610" offset="1403151">Merrill Lynch or other parties may then seek to commence further litigation in light of changed circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.035" offset="1428856">We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and we remand the case with instructions to order the District Court to dismiss the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.408" offset="1458322">Justice Stevens has filed an -- an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.755" offset="1475772">Justice Souter has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.</text>
