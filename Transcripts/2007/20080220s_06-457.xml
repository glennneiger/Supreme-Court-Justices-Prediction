            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104709">As -- as part of its effort to deregulate trucking industry, Congress prohibited States from enacting any law "related to the price, route or service of a motor carrier".</text>
            <text syncTime="15.217" offset="165522">Now, the question in this case is whether that federal law I just read preempts, i.e. sets aside to Maine tobacco laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.150" offset="201258">The first law requires sellers, who ship tobacco into Maine, to use a shipping company that will make certain that the person, who receives and signs for the package is over 18, and is the same person as the one who brought the tobacco.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.348" offset="262071">The second law assumes that the carrier knows that a package that's marked in a certain way will be shipped from certain people, contains tobacco and then therefore is illegal to transport under Maine law, under certain circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.862" offset="320062">Now, in our view, both of these provisions do amount for the state regulation of a service, a service of a motor carrier and the federal law forbids the State from doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.160" offset="365307">In Morales versus Trans World Airlines, we said a -- similar federal language preempts at the least those state statutes that have a "connection" with the services that carriers provide and at least have a significant negative impact upon what Congress was trying to achieve in this deregulatory statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.570" offset="446913">These two particular Maine laws fail these tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.492" offset="462587">The first one amounts to a state rule that requires carriers to provide a particular set of tobacco recipient verification services, it's a very detailed thing they have to provide there and those services that under if there were deregulation of services, the companies would have their choice to provide them or not as they chose.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.935" offset="548373">So the Maine law stops them from having their services as you have to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.372" offset="566136">The second law in effect requires a carrier specially to check all the packages that go to Maine to see whether those markings are there or not or who they were sent by.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.653" offset="607305">Again, the federal statute leaves it up to the carriers to choose whatever checking methods they want to choose, subject to federal regulation, not the state regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.326" offset="649937">This isn't to say that the carriers are automatically exempt from all state regulation, but they are at least exempt from the specific detailed state regulation that's aimed directly at carriers and designed to substitute state service mandates for those of the carriers on choice, which is what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.584" offset="722975">Maine's primary counter-arguments focus on the fact that if the laws serve desirable, health-related purposes, namely to help prevent minors from obtaining tobacco and we assume that is an excellent purpose, but still the federal statute governs and the federal statute doesn't provide a health related exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.748" offset="803641">And if we try to read that into that, we would somehow -- suddenly permit a vast web of state regulation covering all kinds of products and potentially varying from one state to another which his precisely what Congress did not want.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.121" offset="865186">Maine statutes here essentially seek to conscript the carriers into Maine's efforts to help -- help them regulate tobacco sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.538" offset="902802">They have more than a peripheral or indirect effect on carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.484" offset="918580">They don't present a borderline case.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.252" offset="929656">We consequently need not decide just when a regulation's effect upon carriers is too remote the warrant preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.554" offset="958913">So we affirm the Court of Appeals decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.841" offset="971974">Everyone agrees to that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.134" offset="981169">Justice Ginsburg has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.215" offset="993499">Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in part.</text>
