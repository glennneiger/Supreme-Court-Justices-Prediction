            <label>Mr. Paul Stern</label>
            <text syncTime="9.902" offset="207052">Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress has left to the States and encouraged them to deal with the significant public health problem of youth access to tobacco.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.366" offset="252818">The question presented is whether the FAAA Act nonetheless preempts the two State laws before the Court and those laws that ensure that tobacco shipped into the State of Maine does not end up in the hands of our children.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.596" offset="301824">It is not contested that Maine can and, in fact, has banned the retail sale of tobacco unless the seller verifies the age of the buyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.450" offset="349158">Section 1555-C(3)(C) regulates the seller and not a carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.246" offset="376430">It requires that a... in the context of a delivery sale, a seller cannot engage in that sale in the State of Maine unless the seller ensures that the person delivering the tobacco actually verifies the age of the buyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.316" offset="440691">This law does not relate to the services of the carrier, but rather relates to a dangerous substance that Congress has asked the States and left to the States and encouraged the States to deal with.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="83.841" offset="502758">Well, certainly that may be true, but it certainly relates to the service of a carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.324" offset="524701">I understood your argument to be that we can't read that language literally.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="93.760" offset="542464">It talks about what carriers have to do, so... in connection with delivery, so it relates to the service of the motor carrier.</text>

          <turn speaker="paul_stern" startTime="100.726" stopTime="118.374">
            <label>Mr. Paul Stern</label>
            <text syncTime="100.726" offset="570258">--Well, Your Honor, section 1555-C (3)(C) does not dictate at all what a carrier has to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.941" offset="599202">It is an incentive that permits a carrier, if the carrier wishes to compete on a level playing field for the legal tobacco delivery market--</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="118.374" offset="640893">It doesn't dictate what they have to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.748" offset="654372">They can get out of the business.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_stern" startTime="122.998" stopTime="160.575">
            <label>Mr. Paul Stern</label>
            <text syncTime="122.998" offset="659388">--They can get out of the business or compete for the business, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.058" offset="679659">But the point is that the law regulates the retailer and not the carrier and, in doing so, similar to the situation in Travelers, allows for a market to be created.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.645" offset="746010">In particular, however, with respect to this particular situation, Congress has spoken directly to it and this Court has considered in the context of its ERISA cases how Congress has dealt specifically with the problem before the Court.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="160.575" stopTime="172.915">
            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="160.575" offset="809749">Well, we also considered it in Morales, and I thought this law was enacted in the immediate wake of Morales, which adopted a much broader reading of ERISA cases.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_stern" startTime="172.915" stopTime="214.102">
            <label>Mr. Paul Stern</label>
            <text syncTime="172.915" offset="859068">We don't agree that it adopted such a broad view because in Morales the Court was very careful in the opinion to make clear that it was not drawing a line which would bring potentially such laws dealing with gambling or prostitution within the preemptive ambit of the ADA.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.858" offset="950810">Similarly, in... with respect to the FAA Act, particularly looking at the legislative history, there is no indication that Congress intended in any way to deal with the State's controlling and regulating dangerous substances such as tobacco.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="214.102" stopTime="280.621">
            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="214.102" offset="1023848">But isn't that answering the wrong question?</text>
            <text syncTime="216.006" offset="1031372">I'll be candid with you.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.068" offset="1039626">I'm not sure that whatever Morales-Travelers distinction there is really counts here, because the issue here is different from the issue in some of the... in most of the preemption cases, because the issue here starts with the, I think, the agreed assumption that Congress wanted to end a certain category of regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.371" offset="1132831">And the question is would Congress have wanted, in effect, to permit a degree of State regulation when it was for a particular purpose?</text>
            <text syncTime="252.851" offset="1178807">And the question then is not whether Congress intended or had as an object when it passed this statute an interference with the State's regulation of juvenile contraband.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.125" offset="1247874">The question is whether it intended to permit any regulation with respect to delivery services to survive; and isn't that the tough question that you've got to face?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_stern" startTime="280.621" stopTime="306.845">
            <label>Mr. Paul Stern</label>
            <text syncTime="280.621" offset="1289879">Your Honor, looking at the objectives of Congress as explained by Congress in the legislative record, it's very clear that Congress was concerned, the committee was concerned with, the proponents such as the Federal Department of Transportation, were concerned with the effects of the particular category of regulation, State economic regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.018" offset="1379427">The committee mentioned that nine times.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.986" offset="1387368">The United States--</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="306.845" offset="1394787">That's because most regulation, you know, has an economic purpose involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.218" offset="1416312">But the ultimate object, it seems to me, was to end the economic effects of State patchwork transportation regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.572" offset="1461661">And therefore I think the question you've got to address is why would they have allowed a certain category of regulation that clearly affects the way these companies perform their services to survive solely on the ground that the regulation was entailed at the State level by the State's choice to go against youthful tobacco use?</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul Stern</label>
            <text syncTime="352.327" offset="1576704">--Well, Your Honor, we suggest that the Court looks at the FAA Act and its legislative history, as well as what immediately preceded it, which was the Synar Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.821" offset="1622679">The Synar Amendment encouraged the States to deal with this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.101" offset="1639816">The Federal Government--</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="369.413" offset="1645040">But the Synar... I don't have it in front of me, but the Synar Amendment refers to... to a number of objects of State legislation that would be required, but it doesn't say anything about regulating transportation.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul Stern</label>
            <text syncTime="386.797" offset="1714630">--It states quite clearly that the intent is to encourage the States to prohibit... or to enforce/enact laws that prohibit retailers and distributors from getting tobacco to children.</text>

            <text syncTime="405.007" offset="1787460">And we don't normally think of a delivery service as a distributor of goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.255" offset="1816403">I mean, we... in the sense, I think, that the statute meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.003" offset="1835421">I... I read the Synar Amendment reference to distributors as being wholesalers, people within the industry who get the cigarettes from, you know, the manufacturing point to the corner store, as opposed simply to a delivery service that delivers all kinds of goods.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul Stern</label>
            <text syncTime="435.230" offset="1908354">Well, a sale consists of several components, Your Honor: Order, payment, and delivery.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.304" offset="1940642">Handing it over, handing the tobacco over physically to the buyer, from the standpoint of the buyer's standpoint and from the standpoint of public health perspective, is the most important aspect of the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.175" offset="1992051">It is the seller who has the responsibility to comply with the law with respect to each one of those steps.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="463.422" offset="2021099">Mr. Stern, at the time that the motor carrier deregulation came into effect, were there any products where Maine told the retailer, if you want to sell not face-to-face, you must choose a carrier that will provide X, Y, and Z services?</text>
            <text syncTime="489.067" offset="2123708">Was there any... is tobacco alone or were there other commodities?</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul Stern</label>
            <text syncTime="494.518" offset="2145442">Interestingly, there... Maine being a hunting State, there was a law on the books which required the common carrier... it specifically referred to the common carrier... to verify that the person shipping it was the hunter with the appropriate license, required the common carrier to affix identification tags to the hunting... the hunting reward, so to speak, and also to make a return or provide notice to the Commissioner of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.614" offset="2277830">So Maine had a variety of those sorts of laws on the books that required carriers to actually do something with respect to a particular type of commodity.</text>

            <text syncTime="2114.879" offset="8626944">But it makes very clear that the State law is pre-empted, Pet.

            <text syncTime="2769.493" offset="11245354">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: I think there's no question that the State of Maine could not require carriers to obtain a license to deliver tobacco products and condition that upon the carrier's service complying with the mandates of State law, that that would be a law that relates to the carrier's service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.047" offset="11347545">Now, Maine maintains that its law is saved from preemption because of two distinctions: One, it that is adopted with a health rather than economic purpose, and because it operates directly on the shipper rather than the carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.288" offset="11420583">And we don't think that either of those arguments is consistent with the text, structure, or legislative history of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2825.816" offset="11470634">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.409" offset="11473037">But it's worth noting that those arguments, in any event, only go to the provision in C(3)(C).</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.140" offset="11503966">The provision that is under dispute in section D does not have either of those characteristics.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.340" offset="11536776">It operates directly on the carrier, and it is not adopted for the health concern but rather to support the State's licensing and tax purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.851" offset="11578781">But if I could go back to the reasons why their argument is inconsistent with the text, structure, and history of the Federal act, as Respondents' counsel noted, Congress did consider an alternative version of this bill, one that was limited to economic regulation, and the Congress rejected the Senate version and adopted instead the House version that much more broadly pre-empted State regulation related to carrier services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.917" offset="11707094">It added the provision of services and adopted the "related to" standard rather than regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.117" offset="11731858">And so it has rejected this limitation that Petitioners urge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.646" offset="11757981">Moreover, the argument that there is a general health exception to the pre-emptive force of the FAAAA is inconsistent with the structure of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.689" offset="11802180">There are specific exceptions in the Act related, for example, to motor carrier safety, but those exceptions correspond to other grants of authority to the Secretary of Transportation to adopt regulations and to pre-empt State regulations that would interfere with interstate commerce or impose too much of a burden on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.664" offset="11890056">There is no similar back top, if the court reads into the FAAAA a textual general exception for any act adopted with a health purpose by the States.</text>

            <text syncTime="3408.084" offset="13799711">And they can keep track of tobacco commodities.</text>

            <text syncTime="3576.578" offset="14473670">With respect to the computer system... and the record is full of citations to it, for example, at pages 92 and 95... they have done a study of their computer system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.902" offset="14522990">They have not attempted in any way to research whether any of the companies on the list of unlicensed retailers is actually in their system so they can be picked up by the system.</text>
