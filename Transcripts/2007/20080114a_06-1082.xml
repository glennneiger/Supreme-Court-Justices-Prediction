            <text syncTime="23.540" offset="266046">The Court has found that this standard represents the best compromise between the needs of the citizens and the duty of the government to combat crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.769" offset="306902">While the States are free to build additional procedures on this constitutional bedrock, when they do so these additional procedures are matters of State law.</text>

            <text syncTime="48.467" offset="365730">The Court below erred in substituting this clear, established, uniform, time-tested standard for a standard that has none of those virtues.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.212" offset="416721">First, it is undeniable that if State law can raise the constitutional bar, that it will lead to widespread differences on the exact same facts, on the exact same crime, not only across State lines, but also within a particular jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1042.238" offset="4340835">It could either federalize some sort of an amorphous requirement that there must be law enforcement authority in an official in order for that official to engage in Fourth Amendment activity, or it could hold that, what I think is the more reasonable approach, which is that the bedrock requirements of the Fourth Amendment protect against arbitrariness, and the crucial one here is the existence of probable cause based on the facts to believe that the individual has violated a law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.163" offset="4460476">If that criteria is met, it is not constitutionally unreasonable, absent where an extraordinary intrusion for the individual's liberty or privacy interests to be compromised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.158" offset="4512512">It may be the most flagrant violation of departmental regulations in the world, and in that case the department that has those regulations can take action, just as here Virginia says if you violate the arrestable offense rule under Virginia law, the consequence is not to exclude evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.840" offset="4583251">Virginia will not exclude evidence under its own State law for a violation of this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.633" offset="4606343">But it does say under State law that a person can resist an unlawful arrest, The officer can be sued for engaging in an unlawful arrest under State law, and that the officer can be fired or disciplined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.079" offset="4680113">And those are the sanctions that the State has chosen to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.000" offset="4691816">Now, what the Virginia Supreme Court has done is come along and say, even though you do not intend this rule to trigger the exclusionary rule under Virginia law, you have no choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.276" offset="4736956">As a matter of Federal constitutional law, if Virginia decides to exceed the constitutional minimum as this Court announced in Atwater and place additional restrictions on the arrest authority, it must pay a constitutional price of having the evidence excluded if that rule is violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.644" offset="4810412">At the outset, it's clear that imposing such a Fourth Amendment rule would do nothing other than discourage the States from providing additional restrictions as a matter of their own State's law that may serve to protect citizen privacy interests above the floor that this Court has identified as required by the Fourth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1218.417" offset="5045514">What the Court has done, I think, under related issues under Fourth Amendment law is announce pretty clearly that the fact that a State has either renounced an interest in taking a particular law enforcement action that it could otherwise constitutionally take or positively prohibited a law enforcement action does not mean that the action is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.160" offset="5120538">As long ago as the Cooper v. California case, the Court dealt with the situation where an officer was not authorized to undertake an inventory search, and the California courts treat it as a violation of their own law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.747" offset="5174872">This Court said it was still a reasonable search under the Fourth Amendment; and unless Respondent... excuse me, unless... well, Respondent concludes that there should be a different Fourth Amendment rule for searches than procedures, Cooper stands for the proposition that a violation of State law does not ipso facto equate to a violation of the Federal Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1286.889" offset="5319382">And you could make the same argument that Respondent is making here today: That California had renounced any interest in conducting garbage searches, therefore there's nothing on the State side of the line to balance against the individual's invasion of privacy, and therefore the State should lose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.149" offset="5380404">And this Court held precisely the opposite in California v. Greenwood, finding that it was constitutionally reasonable to engage in the garbage search because there was no federally recognized expectation of privacy, even though the State had decided to go further and grant an additional layer of protection to its citizens.</text>

            <text syncTime="1496.711" offset="6158644">States could overrule within their own jurisdictions the Federal rule that this Court announced in Riverside.</text>

            <text syncTime="1515.921" offset="6235548">And most directly here, Atwater would be overruled with respect to non-arrestable offenses if Respondent's position is correct that when the State has said that we don't want to undertake an arrest for a minor offense, therefore, there's no longer any State interest in undertaking the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.116" offset="6308273">The reality is that this Court has balanced as a matter of Fourth Amendment law what is constitutionally necessary as a uniform Federal matter to protect people against arbitrary law enforcement action, and it's drawn the line at probable cause.</text>

            <text syncTime="1807.619" offset="7402281">Whren is different in several different ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.867" offset="7411268">The first is that that was a challenge to the stop, not the search incident to arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.132" offset="7428404">The claim was that the officers under a local D.C. Government regulation did not have the power to make a traffic stop because there was a local regulation that said if you're not in uniform and if you're not in a police car, a marked car, you shouldn't make those traffic stops.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.720" offset="7482739">So, it's different on a couple of different actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.938" offset="7491620">The nature of the constitutional challenge, the nature of the law that's being evoked, the local regulation rather than legislation, I think, are the principal ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.591" offset="7522236">Here we're dealing with something quite fundamental, and I haven't gotten to this Court's precedents applying the common law rule that I described at the beginning, so if I could do and then compare Whren.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.962" offset="7555672">Post... define the common law, every since Weeks, which is the first case of this Court to recognize the search incident arrest exception, all the way through Di Re, Miller, Johnson, Ker, DeFillippo, those are five cases that confront the question in this case, I believe that genuinely confront it; is not dictum, it is holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.344" offset="7637174">Those cases confront the question: Can you have a constitutional search incident to an illegal arrest?</text>

            <text syncTime="2075.121" offset="8472361">The first half hour focused on the constitutionality of the arrest vel non, which is at issue in Atwater, for example, and at issue... not even in Whren, which is just a traffic stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.429" offset="8517605">I am focusing on the somewhat different point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.882" offset="8523352">There is a line of cases that deals with the constitutionality of the search incident to arrest and it says because at common law you could not search someone pursuant to an arrest that was a trespass, the search itself is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.172" offset="8584583">So if at the time of the framing a Federal officer, a Federal marshal, at the time of the framing had the power to arrest them for State law offenses, as they still do under the OLC opinions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2537.905" offset="10323503">Obviously, if there is no probable cause or if there wasn't a crime at all, as just defined, the answer is yes; but then I look at Whren and it says if all that was at stake was a kind of arrest procedure State law, herein... there embodied in a rule, the answer is no.</text>

            <text syncTime="2558.711" offset="10406677">And this one it seems to me there is probable cause; it is a crime; moreover, it is a crime for which the State permits arrest where the officer subjectively thinks he's likely to keep driving.</text>

            <text syncTime="3584.940" offset="14511558">Mr. McCullough, there is one thing that I was curious about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.578" offset="14530157">It is this Virginia law that allows the custodial arrest pursuant to an order of a general district court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3599.889" offset="14571431">That is used with some frequency, and we certainly saw an increase in the wake of the Moore decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.464" offset="14597658">I can't go county by county and city by city, but it has common currency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.947" offset="14619601">And one example is Portsmouth evidently, although it is not clear... we have gotten conflicting answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.020" offset="14651888">When Mr. Moore was arrested, there is no such order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.754" offset="14658889">But a few miles down the road the City of Virginia Beach does have such an order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.019" offset="14675921">And this just shows the complexities the Court would be stepping in where, if Mr. Moore is arrested in Portsmouth for the exact same crime on the exact same facts, it is unconstitutional under Moore's rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.983" offset="14723777">But he goes a few miles down the road to the City of Virginia Beach, and the arrest is perfectly constitutional because the district court has entered such an order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.995" offset="14755855">And it just doesn't make sense, as the Court noted in Whren, for constitutional provisions to be so variable.</text>
