            <text syncTime="348.582" offset="1559819">In the context of the coal tax, Your Honor, and the Export Clause claim, the purpose of requiring exhaustion, requiring Respondents to proceed before the IRS, is that the coal tax is exempt from taxation under the Constitution only if the coal at the moment the tax is imposed, which in this case is when it's first sold by the manufacturer, the mining company, if at that moment, the coal was in the stream of export.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.683" offset="1668175">And in the context of the coal industry that can be a fairly fact-specific question, and the IRS technical advice memorandum that we've cited on page 11 of our reply brief explains that to some degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.147" offset="1718016">So it's possible for a timely refund claim to allow the IRS to examine the facts and circumstances of the transaction and determine whether in fact the coal was in the stream of export at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.219" offset="1770366">Further, the IRS... if it has only an excise tax return from the taxpayer, IRS has no idea what percentage of that coal was exported.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.792" offset="1812580">Well over 90 percent of the coal mined in the United States remains in the United States and there's nothing on Form 720, the excite tax return, that specifies how much of that coal is exported.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.430" offset="1859182">So effectively by filing the two-page refund claim the taxpayer puts the IRS on notice of what percentage of coal in the given years was in fact in the stream of export when it was sold, whether in fact the broker or whoever purchased it actually purchased it, actually exported it from the country, and also how... what the dollar amount of tax refund is being sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.388" offset="1947058">So all of those, we think, are perfectly valid purposes for requiring a short but reasonable time to proceed before the IRS.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.949" offset="1973285">And if the IRS denies the claim, then of course Respondents could have proceeded directly to court.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.774" offset="1992511">The IRS did not in fact deny their claim, and the IRS has issued a notice of acquiescence specifying that the coal tax... coal taxpayers who paid this coal tax and filed timely refund claims will receive a refund to the full extent that Congress has permitted the IRS to grant refunds.</text>

            <text syncTime="703.191" offset="2978268">And we've cited some... some examples in our opening brief of numerous constitutional provisions that taxpayers may bring challenges under.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.797" offset="3012645">And there are at least five clauses in the original Constitution that regulate the Federal Government's taxing authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="761.915" offset="3213161">Before there was the Tucker Act, Your Honor, when the government took property and was obliged to pay compensation, the claim was presented to Congress; and Congress could legislative relief by a private bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.879" offset="3261017">Eventually, Congress created the Court of Claims purely as an Article I tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.453" offset="3279303">There was no judicial review because the decisions were always subject to revision by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.232" offset="3294349">And eventually Congress, having tired of adjudicating all these claims in a legislative manner, gave the Court of Claims independent status with its decisions reviewable in Article III courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.367" offset="3358924">And so, by enacting the Tucker Act, takings claims became brought in the Court of Federal Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.112" offset="3389853">So, because we think Section 7422(a) is a completely adequate remedy for any constitutional claim that Respondents might bring, we submit that this Court's Bivens cases and this Court's unlawful-tax cases show that there is no warrant to create a new cause of action directly under the Constitution in circumstances like this where the taxpayer has a fully effective remedy, allows that remedy to become time-barred, but instead brings a claim, purportedly under the Constitution, against the identical defendant, in the identical forum seeking the identical relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.222" offset="3542304">Under those circumstances, this Court has never fashioned a Bivens-type implied cause of action for a violation of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.614" offset="3567904">Indeed, in Bush versus Lucas, Schweiker versus Chilicky, and other cases, the Court has recognized that when Congress has legislated a remedial scheme, it doesn't... this Court will still stay its hand before creating a new Bivens action, even if that remedial scheme has very short time limits, such as the 30-day time limit, the civil service remedies that were at issue in Bush, or the exhaustion requirement of Title VII which substitutes for an equal-protection claim for Federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.208" offset="3682320">Even in those circumstances, and even if the remedies that are available are equitable and not money damages, even in those circumstances this Court will not create a new cause of action for money damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.281" offset="3730594">And in this case, if Respondents had filed in a timely way in this... referring to the relief that they're seeking in this case, they're seeking relief for 1994, 1995 and 1996.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.607" offset="3779914">If they had filed by April 30th, 1997, by which point Cyprus Amex Coal Company was already vigorously litigating the constitutionality of the coal excise tax in the Court of Federal Claims, if they had filed by that time, they could have received full relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.116" offset="3833935">So their failure to assert their rights in a timely way certainly didn't give the court of appeals warrant to create a new Bivens-type implied right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.846" offset="3868834">If the Court has no further questions at this time, I'll reserve.</text>

            <text syncTime="1868.853" offset="7640916">And there's authority that says if the IRS's position is too far out, you can go get an injunction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1876.990" offset="7673412">And then you're argument is, because of that authority, that kind of an exception for the far out IRS claim also applies to the statute of limitation and administrative requirement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1890.172" offset="7726180">And the reason that that's a problem, I take it, is because when you're talking about injunctions, you're talking about basic equity, but when you're talking about later on administrative requirements, there's really no reason they couldn't have filed the claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="1952.431" offset="7975179">This Court was specific in Enochs versus Williams Packing, when it said, our prior decision under Miller versus Standard Nut, in which you had done a more generous view of this get around the Tax Injunction Act, was wrong, because the Tax Injunction Act is not an equitable rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.253" offset="8034425">Enochs was a statutory construction rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.500" offset="8047486">Pages 6, 7, and 8 of that decision make it plain in terms... you talk about what the act requires, and the language of this Court is construing is the phrase "any tax".</text>

            <text syncTime="2615.140" offset="10625980">One, because any tax only applies when there is asserted legitimate basis for the tax; and two, the Export Clause is a unique limitation, specifically denies the government any authority to use exports as a source of revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.678" offset="10692123">And you have a refund scheme here that has been designed over the years specifically to protect revenue interest, to make you pay the revenue first and have them hold it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2653.106" offset="10777909">That's one way why the interest calculation might be different under the Tucker Act than it would be under the refund scheme, just the timing of whether it's the deposit or the actual return.</text>

            <text syncTime="2679.646" offset="10884070">Exports are completely off limits to the tax power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.143" offset="10902043">And Congress using its tax power to create a tax scheme that specifically preserves and protects revenue and is not a revenue neutral system is not the best scheme for vindicating the Export Clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="2768.856" offset="11240903">Enochs case construed not Section 7422, but Section 7421, the Injunction Act provision of the tax code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.836" offset="11276847">And the question in Enochs was whether the taxpayer simply by alleging that the tax was so... so invalidly applied that it was only in the guise of the tax could avoid paying the tax and bring an injunctive claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.896" offset="11337034">The court in Enochs held that it could not because the taxpayer had not, in fact, satisfied the basic requirement of all claims for injunctive relief as irreparable injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.092" offset="11381860">And the court also held that whether a tax is defensible for purposes of this very narrow exception is to be determined on the basis of the information to the government at the time of suit.</text>

            <text syncTime="2834.219" offset="11502336">Justice Breyer alluded to this when he asked my friend, Ms. Millett, about whether this exception is geared primarily to factual issues or to legal issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.218" offset="11534310">In Standard Nut and Margarine the government had decided to attempt to impose a tax meant for oleomargarine on a product made entirely from nuts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.275" offset="11574539">And this Court, you know, without construing the tax-injunctive provision, simply referring to principles of equity, this Court held that the government's theory of assessing the tax was simply in the guise of a tax and it permitted the injunctive claim to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.374" offset="11650921">In Williams Packing the government's... the government had a collateral basis for assessing the tax, and so the taxpayer was remitted to the same remedy that any taxpayer who wants to challenge a tax as having been unlawfully assessed or collected is subject to; that is, to pay the tax, file a refund claim, and if the refund claim is upheld either by the IRS or subsequently in court, to receive a full refund with interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="2938.313" offset="11918728">One is that we don't think that a... an exception to the... to 7421 should carry over into Section 7422.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.765" offset="11948508">But even in the circumstances of this case, this is a facially constitutional tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.495" offset="11967420">The tax is imposed on coal mined in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.340" offset="11982780">And if no... if none of the coal that is subject to the tax is ever in the stream of export when the tax is imposed, then the tax is perfectly constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.132" offset="12014023">And that is why Section 4121 remains on the books today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.536" offset="12027607">The tax is unconstitutional only in certain narrow circumstances when the coal actually is is in the stream of export.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.426" offset="12055192">As I explained--</text>

            <text syncTime="2977.640" offset="12075985">It is a perfectly valid tax but not when you impose it on nuts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.640" offset="12091972">And here the tax on coal is a perfectly valid tax, but not when you impose it on coal that's in the stream of export.</text>

            <text syncTime="2990.590" offset="12127812">--But if one of these coal companies had sought to enjoin the tax, the government would have pointed to the provision in Williams Packing that says that whether the tax is defensible is to be determined on the basis of the information available to the government at the time of suit until the taxpayer demonstrates that the coal is actually in the stream of export, which is precisely what's done during the refund process that the taxpayers used in this case to show that their coal was in the stream of export when they obtained the refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.031" offset="12237631">That's what... that's how they obtained a full... full relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.872" offset="12260932">But, in any event, the history of this litigation shows that this is not... this is not a claim about the facial unconstitutionality of the tax because the tax continued to be collected without protest in the case of the Respondents here for 21 consecutive years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.412" offset="12323104">And by the time they filed for a refund this Court had decided IBM.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.255" offset="12342434">It had decided U.S. shoe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.710" offset="12348286">The district court had decided Ranger Fuel, and the government had announced that it would not appeal the decision in Ranger Fuel striking down the coal tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.299" offset="12378692">But that doesn't mean that for that... for that entire time the government had no basis on which to defend the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.702" offset="12404292">I mean the government had colorable arguments to defend the tax at issue in U.S. Shoe in June 1996.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.182" offset="12434176">And it had colorful arguments to defend the harbor maintenance tax in U.S. Shoe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.682" offset="12452149">I may have misspoke.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.321" offset="12454761">IBM in 1996, and U.S. Shoe in 1998.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.990" offset="12469389">So to say that during the period at issue in this case, 1994 through 1996, the tax was so facially invalid that the narrow Williams Packing exception to another statutory provision justifies Respondents' attempt to circumvent the tax refund statute, we just think is not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.482" offset="12543368">In the case of a taxpayer who... who can satisfy the exception, you know, the Tax Code does, indeed, put that taxpayer to the choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.902" offset="12593105">It gives them a fully effective post-payment refund remedy where they can avoid any penalties and interest by paying the tax and litigating for a full refund.</text>

            <text syncTime="3200.049" offset="12965611">And when it says it is within the guise of a tax, then it doesn't fall within the Tax Injunction Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.908" offset="12993092">And there it says if it is clear that under no circumstances could the government ultimately prevail, the central purpose of the Tax Injunction Act is inapplicable.</text>

            <label>Mr. William M. Jay</label>
            <text syncTime="3231.210" offset="13090268">Well, my specific response, Your Honor, first is that in this case the tax simply was not in the guise of a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.689" offset="13120256">But even if, you know, today, if the taxpayer were... if a taxpayer were alleging that the coal tax were in the guise of a tax and that it, therefore, could bring a prepayment... a prepayment action, it does not then follow that the taxpayer could still after the fact, if it opted not to bring that prepayment action, the taxpayer could then escape the three-year, nontollable, unusually emphatic limitation period that applies to a claim for a postpayment remedy, which is the exclusive means of obtaining a postpayment remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.145" offset="13262049">And, you know, the courts recognized time and again that taxing authorities have a strong interest in fiscal stability, and it effectively closes the books on a particular tax year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.953" offset="13305308">So that taxpayers, after the tax is paid, if they want to protest the tax, they have three years in which to put the government on notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.058" offset="13333729">That, you know, even if the claim is this tax is so beyond the pale that it can't be defended, they have to put the government on notice of that claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.306" offset="13366643">And if they do, then the IRS considers it; and if the IRS turns them down, then they can proceed to district court or to the Court of Federal Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.132" offset="13397990">In addition, I think I just wanted to clarify one point about the availability of prepayment remedies in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.330" offset="13446787">I think, Justice Ginsburg, my friend, Miss Millett, was correct about the fact that this excise tax does not... is not susceptible to the deficiency proceeding in tax court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.416" offset="13491091">And we have cited in footnote 7 of our reply brief at page 16 the possibility that there may be another route if the taxpayer feels strongly about the unconstitutionality of the tax and is willing to take the chance that if the taxpayer's position is rejected, that the taxpayer may be liable for penalties and interest for not paying the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.394" offset="13579071">I mean, of course, the general rule is that the taxpayer is expected to pay the tax and proceed postpayment by putting the IRS on notice of the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.345" offset="13610836">But Congress, in Section 6330(c)(2)(B) of Title 26, has provided some limited ability, if a taxpayer has not previously been able to litigate the merits of the tax, the taxpayer has a limited opportunity to do so first before the IRS, then in Tax Court, and then before the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.522" offset="13687531">And, again, on Miss Millett's supposition that this is a completely, clearly unconstitutional tax, then the taxpayer would have the option of doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.938" offset="13741239">Again, the refund scheme is set up so that if the taxpayer doesn't want to take the chance that its argument will not be accepted, the taxpayer has a simple, open remedy: To file a refund claim at any point within three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.841" offset="13792857">That's exactly what Respondents did not do for the 21 consecutive years that they paid this tax without complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.431" offset="13819189">If the Court has no further questions?</text>
