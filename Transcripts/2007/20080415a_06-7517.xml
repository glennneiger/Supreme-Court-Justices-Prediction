            <text syncTime="10.684" offset="205186">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This is a sentencing process case.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.588" offset="224726">The first step of the sentencing process described by the Court in Rita, as noticed, broke down in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.835" offset="253774">The Petitioner first learned that the district court contemplated a non-Guideline sentence when it was pronounced.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.614" offset="280837">The grounds for that statutory maximum sentence were not noticed and the issues were, therefore, not litigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.925" offset="306123">The government here agrees that the lack of notice was error and advocates notices for all sentences outside the Guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.841" offset="337784">This is the correct result.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.388" offset="343949">Because it's only through notice can the sentencing court subject a defendant's sentence to the thorough adversarial testing contemplated by Federal sentencing procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.492" offset="396403">That quote comes from Rita and relies upon rules 32(f), (h), (i), and a decision of this Court in United States versus Burns.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.379" offset="443946">That law controls the decision in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="87.949" offset="514163">And if you had a response to that, which is, well, if he took his medication, it wouldn't be a problem, I assume you would have prepared for that.</text>

            <text syncTime="107.114" offset="590858">It is directed toward the 4A1.3 departure.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.425" offset="604128">The concerns raised by that are completely different than the grounds on which the court departed.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.205" offset="627221">So, no, that wasn't adequate notice.</text>

            <text syncTime="118.578" offset="636729">Well, yeah, I... but in terms of what issues might suggest themselves to a judge sentencing this particularly defendant, I would have thought future dangerousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.855" offset="673823">I mean, you have an individual who has leveled particular threats with some degree of certainty that he intends to pursue them, I would have thought that would have been one of the first things a sentencing judge would look at.</text>

            <text syncTime="140.085" offset="722724">Well, it was looked at in the context of the sixth level enhancement for intent to carry out the threat, and it did come up in the context of acceptance of responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.784" offset="761490">But both look at different issues than the ground that the sentence was ultimately... the... the upward non-Guideline sentence was ultimately imposed on.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="160.077" offset="802659">Well, you know this... this provision 32(h), really doesn't... does simply not work with post-Booker guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.384" offset="847903">You either have to say it was designed for a different regime, and therefore, has no effect now after Booker, or else you have to expand it beyond what it says, because may depart from the applicable sentencing range on a ground not identified, under the mandatory guidelines, they were identified grounds for departure.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.812" offset="941630">And you had some... the court could look at those and say, gee, am I going to pick one of these, if so I'll let him know.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.295" offset="971619">But you can depart now simply on the ground that you don't agree with the... with what the Guidelines say as... is that what you would call a ground of departure?</text>
            <text syncTime="215.710" offset="1025222">It's simply a ground of disagreement, I would suppose.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.677" offset="1041105">Why shouldn't we hold 32(h) simply.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.582" offset="1056778">Simply has no... no application under the new system?</text>
            <text syncTime="229.362" offset="1079870">Or at least hold that all it applies to are departures within the meaning of the old mandatory guidelines system?</text>
            <text syncTime="237.983" offset="1114352">Which is a much narrower category of departures.</text>

            <text syncTime="242.700" offset="1133160">I think first it would seem to make... it would not make sense to demand notice for a finite range of factors, but no notice for a potentially broader one.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.225" offset="1183315">That seems counter-intuitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.069" offset="1190630">But--</text>

            <text syncTime="264.926" offset="1222081">But if the number of grounds is infinite, I'm much less inclined to read it as even applicable to the situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="273.970" offset="1258234">--But the... the decision of... in Burns, I think, answers the question because unless there's... if a party is not focused... and generally the parties' papers and the PSR will focus the issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.854" offset="1309852">But in the few cases where... where an extraneous sentencing consideration that's important enough to drive the sentence up or down is raised, in order to have adversarial testing of that important issue, there has to be some kind of notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.379" offset="1379965">And it's not... variance is not what we're calling a variance, a non-Guidelines sentence is not a pure exercise in policy even in Kimbrough.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.938" offset="1422179">That was a policy disagreement but it was driven by facts, and the defendant in that case, the appellant, gave notice that they were going to be challenging it, and... and there was a factual presentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.681" offset="1481111">So the record was in the right shape to make the policy determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="333.445" offset="1496158">Post-Booker the guidelines are advisory, and the district judge has discretion as to the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.691" offset="1525206">Now, in the bad old days, when the statute said 20 to 40, and the judge decided to give you 40, he didn't have to give you notice of why he was giving you the highest sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.109" offset="1574839">And now that we've returned to a system that is closer to that, why should we interpret 32(h) as imposing a very difficult to comply with requirement that didn't exist under the... under the pre-pre-Booker system?</text>

            <text syncTime="390.796" offset="1725617">Burns... Burns reflects the Court's understanding again of what Congress intended in the Sentencing Reform Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.761" offset="1757487">They said Congress intended notice and litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.713" offset="1769294">Now, this Court had to make some excisions on Sixth Amendment grounds in what Congress... what Congress could do, but their intent hasn't changed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1856.143" offset="7586972">We don't think that notice of the specific fact on which the court is going to rely is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.078" offset="7610692">That would start to make the notice requirement unworkable, but I don't think that's how it's been interpreted, to require the very specific facts in the departure context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.045" offset="7646532">The same situation, the parallel thing applies here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.855" offset="7661787">As I was going to say before on the burdensomeness, it hasn't been burdensome, unduly burdensome, to require notice for traditional, and there really isn't any reason to think that it would be different for here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.865" offset="7713823">And to get back to something earlier as well that we're were talking about, the key fact is rule 32(h) does indisputably require notice for traditional departures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.798" offset="7761575">And a notice requirement for variances is essential to prevent evisceration of that notice requirement because a court can always impose the same... use a variance to impose the same sentence that it could have imposed as a Guidelines departure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.636" offset="7816954">So that notice requirement, which is still in the rule, is going to basically become meaningless unless the word "departure" is given it full scope and construed to include variances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.944" offset="7866169">And notices of variances is also necessary for the focused adversarial testing that rule 32 requires for the reason the Court said in Burns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.502" offset="7908383">If the parties don't know what the potential grounds for a non-Guidelines sentence are, then what they're likely to do is either address the possibility of an above-Guidelines sentence in a random and wasteful way by trying to conceive of every possible grounds or they're just not going to address it at all, like in the example that I gave before when we just didn't address the potential variance based on prison not providing... being able to provide the appropriate treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.193" offset="8027188">And it's still important, even after Booker, to have adversarial testing of that issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="2392.226" offset="9731312">The first is suggested by Justice Ginsburg and Chief Justice Roberts that paragraph 78 of the presentence report put the parties on adequate notice that they could engage in a full adversarial testing outweighing the defendant's future dangerousness against his amenability to alternative methods of treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.952" offset="9818248">The alternative ground for affirming the judgment below is that suggested by Justice Scalia and Justice Alito, namely: That Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(h) was drafted for a different era, an era of mandatory guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.039" offset="9882509">And there is no reason, particularly in light of the right rulemaking process, to extend rule 32 to an advisory guideline era.</text>

            <text syncTime="2461.978" offset="10010300">Justice Ginsburg, I understand your concern about the possibility that district judges might, I guess in theory, attempt to do an end run around rule 32(h) by recasting a departure decision as a variance decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.568" offset="10064634">And, admittedly, there are certain circumstances in which the ground for a departure on rule 32(h) has some overlap with the ground for a variance under 3553(a), but I would offer several responses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.406" offset="10116043">My first response is that I feel the Court crossed that bridge a little bit in the Booker remedial opinion when it created an advisory guidelines system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.981" offset="10146346">The whole premise of the advisory guidelines system was to enhance the discretion of the district judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.260" offset="10167452">My second answer would be that district judges still have a reason to engage in the departure calculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.350" offset="10199844">As this Court made clear in Rita, district judges must begin by consulting the guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.801" offset="10225653">And the Second, Third, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Tenth Courts of Appeal all have interpreted that obligation to consult the Guidelines to include consideration of possible grounds for departure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.547" offset="10280615">Of course, this Court's decision in Kimbrough made clear that even if those two grounds don't provide the judge adequate incentive to engage in a departure calculation, that there is yet another reason; and that is because it may affect the scrutiny-of-reasonableness review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.805" offset="10345608">As the Court explained in Kimbrough, when a district judge departs from the Guidelines, the district judge's determination may be entitled to greater respect when the judge makes the determination that a case takes... that a circumstance takes the case outside of the heartland.</text>

            <text syncTime="2600.782" offset="10565559">Indeed, just this last Friday, the Sentencing Commission posted on its website additional proposed amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines that would inject new grounds for departures including fraud for emergency assistance and violations of Federal food and drug laws that entail a risk of serious bodily injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.210" offset="10655211">Departures remain relevant to the guidelines because they are the basis upon which the Commission can continue to fulfill its mandate to provide for the type of uniform sentencing that still is possible.</text>

            <text syncTime="2637.017" offset="10710486">You're not... a court... a sentencing court, after concluding that there is no ground for a departure under Booker and the later cases, then has to consider the 3553(a) question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.716" offset="10757297">So the decision about the departures is irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.761" offset="10781434">It is not dispositive; and, if the court finds that the case qualified for a Guidelines departure, as I said before, by definition, that is going to be a case where the 3553(a) factors warranted a non-Guidelines sentence anyway.</text>

            <text syncTime="2687.514" offset="10912465">Well, why is the 32(h) obligation relevant?</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.278" offset="10923541">That is, looking through the history of it, I see that in 32(i)(C) it says that the government has to allow the parties' attorneys to comment on the determination of the probation officer and other matters relating to an appropriate sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.802" offset="10997624">Then, in a case called Burns v. United States, this Court says that that right to comment includes a right to notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.547" offset="11036599">And so all that 32(h) did was to take what was already the law and make specific that it includes a right to notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.950" offset="11078186">I take it that was what they were up to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.871" offset="11085918">But even if you didn't have 32(h), you would have precisely the same right once you got 32(i)(C) together with the case of Burns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.771" offset="11133461">So I don't know where that leaves me, except thinking it doesn't matter, because the defendant has precisely the same right either way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.752" offset="11165434">And I guess it's easier just to say "departure" means generally all kinds of departures including not applying it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2761.031" offset="11206499">It is quite right it is not consistent with what they thought they were up to, but not... it is... maybe before... if they had passed this before Hawaii became a State, you could say: Well, they didn't think it would apply in Hawaii.</text>

            <text syncTime="2781.849" offset="11289777">If we were to put 32(h) to one side and consider the effect of rule 32(i)(1)(C), then the Court confronts the question whether the basic ideas that animated its decision in Burns should be extended in an advisory-guidelines era.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.061" offset="11354666">And Burns, at bottom, rested on two distinct strands of reasoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.842" offset="11373787">One was the question of unfair surprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.732" offset="11385281">And we think, with that respect, that the post-Booker era is different from the pre-Booker era.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.636" offset="11408896">And the reason why, Justice Breyer, is because pre-Booker the parties came to the sentencing hearing with an expectation of a within-Guidelines sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.208" offset="11451214">And post-Booker, particularly in light of this Court's decision in Rita, the parties cannot come to the sentencing hearing with that expectation because the district judge may not presume the reasonableness of the within-Guidelines sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.421" offset="11508057">And so to the extent that Burns rested on concerns of unfair surprise, the rationale has dropped out after Booker.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.075" offset="11538672">Now, there is a second strand of reasoning to Burns which Justice Ginsburg alluded to, which is this question of full adversarial testing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.337" offset="11571795">And I agree with you, Chief Justice Roberts, that Chief Judge Boudin's decision in the Vega-Santiago case provides the pathway here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.708" offset="11605232">Judges engage in this kind of discretionary act all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.128" offset="11626861">Parties come to the hearing with a theory, a theory of how the judge should exercise her sentencing discretion within a known range, and knowing the applicable legal criteria, and have an opportunity to be heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.685" offset="11693108">And we believe that, particularly in light of the recent amendment to section 32(d)(2)(F), that's going to include the possibility of the 3553 factors... 3553, a factor in the presentence report, that the parties are going to have the opportunity to come to the hearing with the ability to engage in full adversarial testing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2984.393" offset="12099991">--I... I don't think that it presents a concern of impracticability, Justice Kennedy, for one simple reason; and that is by relying on a mechanism such as the continuance, the parties are given the opportunity to identify for the court whether or not there's a concern of unfair surprise; and if there is, the district judge is in the position to decide whether or not she believes that the continuance is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.663" offset="12217020">If the notice claim only arises at the time that the sentence is entered, there's relatively little opportunity at that point for the district judge to go back and reconsider the record on the basis of unfair surprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.563" offset="12268638">And that sort of takes me to the basic point that Justices Souter, Alito and Justice Ginsburg all talk, about which is the fundamental unworkability of the notice rule and advisory guidelines system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.356" offset="12319838">As the judges... the district judges explained to us in the recent rulemaking proceeding contemplating a amendment to rule 32(h), they're concerned that extending this rule to variances will make it quite difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.865" offset="12377830">We know that district judges often receive these packets of sentencing information only seven days before the sentencing hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.939" offset="12406146">Several courts of appeals have held that giving notice at the sentencing hearing is not timely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.093" offset="12434777">And even if the timeliness concern can be overcome, there are serious problems in workability as to the adequacy of the notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.855" offset="12465810">The best that the Petitioner and the government the instruct this Court on, in terms of how the adequacy standard is going to work, is that it has to be context-specific; and if we put ourselves in the shoes of a district judge that now has to engage in a discretionary act to decide whether or not the notice that I've given is adequate turns on the context, doesn't provide a great deal of guidance to the district judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.580" offset="12560687">We know, for example--</text>

            <text syncTime="3101.220" offset="12567270">Why isn't it just whatever is the reason that the judge is considering is going outside the advisory Guidelines, whatever that reason is, just say it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.810" offset="12617634">So the judge says... could say here,</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.167" offset="12631113">"I'm contemplating going outside because I don't think that this man is going to stop these threats. "</text>

            <text syncTime="3125.913" offset="12666012">--I... certainly, Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.804" offset="12673640">And I've wrestled with that own question in... in my mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.536" offset="12688582">If this judge were to have said I'm thinking of sentencing outside the Guidelines because I'm dealing with an individual who has a demonstrated ability to stalk and threaten his ex-wife, would that have been adequate?</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.921" offset="12746052">And interestingly, I think pages 23 and 126 of the Petitioner's reply brief illustrate that either the answer to that question is going to be "not necessarily", or otherwise appellate judges are going to be strung up having to unpack whether or not notice is adequate, because it is Petitioner's petition in this case that even if the defendant had been put on notice as to the future dangerousness, that that did not, quote, "put the defendant on notice" that the district judge supposed the futility of treatment might justify an outside-the-Guidelines sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.889" offset="12897980">Here's the essential workability problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.123" offset="12906861">We know from this court's decision in Rita that the basic vision in the post-Booker world is to encourage judges to provide reasoned sentencing decisions, where a degree of reasoning may depend a little bit upon whether the judge is engaging an inside-the-advisory-Guidelines sentence, or an outside-the-advisory-Guidelines sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.553" offset="12992648">In the event that a district judge engaging in an outside-the-Guidelines sentence, she is now walking into a trap.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.549" offset="13020546">Because if she imposes it based on a determination about the defendant's future dangerousness, and then in an attempt to provide a full explication of her reasoning makes a statement about the amenability or non-amenability of the defendant to alternative forms of treatment, the aggrieved party will seize on that extra statement and bring it back to the pre-sentencing report and the parties' pleadings and said we may have had notice as to ground one to the variance but we didn't have notice as to ground two.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.943" offset="13146143">Or we may have had notice as to ground one and two, but we didn't have any as to ground three.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.113" offset="13166832">This is the essentially workability concern that we believe that the district judges raised when they expressed their discomfort with the proposed amendments to rule 32(h); and precisely why we think the more prudent course is to affirm the judgment below, either on the narrow ground that I started start with, the Chief Justice's question suggested, or alternatively on the broader grounds suggested by Justice Scalia's questions, that the resume that emerged at the time of mandatory Guidelines should not be extended to the time of advisory Guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.287" offset="13295563">And if I could make one last observation, and then I'll complete my argument unless the Court has further questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.394" offset="13320014">In December of 2007, the Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules formed a subcommittee to study this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.687" offset="13353137">If the Court consults the minutes of that meeting, they didn't form that subcommittee because they were awaiting this Court's decision in Irizarry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.949" offset="13394202">They formed that... cert hadn't been granted in Irizarry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.025" offset="13410502">They formed that subcommittee for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.774" offset="13421474">The first reason was whether in light of this Court's decisions in Gall and Kimbrough a notice requirement was still necessary; and second was the consideration that in light of the breadth of the 3553(a) factors a notice requirement should be removed altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.737" offset="13489392">The more prudent course either for the narrow grounds suggested by Chief Justice Roberts or the broader grounds suggested by Justice Scalia is to affirm the judgment below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.811" offset="13525650">If the Court has no further questions I would be happy to yield back the balance of my time.</text>

            <text syncTime="3350.775" offset="13565461">I think Justice Breyer is correct that rule 32(e) is... requires that the parties have an opportunity to comment on matters appropriate to the sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.409" offset="13635991">That opportunity extends to not only Guidelines departures but also what has been called variances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.625" offset="13660860">There are two reasons why it's important that that... that right comes with a notice requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.762" offset="13693461">The first is that fairness for the individual defendant, the ability to litigate the issues that are going to make a difference in his sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.728" offset="13721359">The other is that it permits as an institutional issue effective appellate review, if there's a developed record and evolution of the Guidelines by looking at the aggregate of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.800" offset="13777575">If the Court's decision is that we're going to exempt from notice requirement the cases that are going... the sentences that are going to be driven towards the margin, high or low, the goal of uniformity that Congress sought in the Sentencing Reform Act would be lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.107" offset="13850822">And I submit that that's an independent reason why the Court ought to require notice is because otherwise, it's inviting the sentencing disparities which the architecture of the Sentencing Reform Act is designed to eliminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.725" offset="13913307">As far as workability, it is extremely rare that the issues aren't flagged in the papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.409" offset="13947998">It is not going to come up frequently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.564" offset="13956670">Rule 32(h) issues don't come up terribly frequently, at least in my practice in the appellate cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.951" offset="13994182">Five circuits below have... saw no workability problem with extending the notice requirement of rule 32(h) to variances as well.</text>
