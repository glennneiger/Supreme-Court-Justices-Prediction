            <label>Mr. Thomas M. Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="7.870" offset="203339">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The trial court was justified in requiring a higher level of competency for self representation in order to prevent the trial of Ahmad Edwards from descending into a farce.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.663" offset="254539">Indeed, self representation where a defendant cannot communicate coherently with the jury or the court would defeat the very autonomy interests that the Court ventured to protect in Faretta.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="30.552" offset="294037">But why is it necessary to have a special rule in order to prevent the trial from descending into a farce?</text>
            <text syncTime="39.475" offset="329772">Why couldn't you simply apply the same rule of competency that you apply for whether the defendant can be tried, and then if in fact his self representation begins to turn the trial into a farce surely the court would have the power to prohibit his further self representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.990" offset="419842">Certainly, turning a trial into a farce is a basis for the court's action; no?</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas M. Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="69.227" offset="448786">Well, I certainly hope so.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.012" offset="455891">And I think on the record we've got here the trial court did not need to wait for that to happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.148" offset="472401">If the trial had begun with Mr. Edwards representing himself with the jury present, and the trial had then become so unwieldy and so farcical and such a mockery that he had... his right of self representation had to be overridden, I think there would have been a problem, a possible problem of taint with the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.991" offset="535826">I think that the court was justified, having seen Mr. Edwards in court--</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="94.545" offset="550037">The problem with taint would be his own fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.428" offset="557560">I can't imagine that he would success on appeal claiming he tainted the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.782" offset="578980">And the advantage of waiting is that by waiting to see if in fact he will turn the trial into a farce you avoid the risk of depriving him of his right to represent himself, which is certainly a very important constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.260" offset="652855">Why didn't you wait to see whether he's going to be able to pull it off or not?</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas M. Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="124.997" offset="671872">--I don't think that Mr. Edwards's sort of waiver by conduct in that context is the only thing to consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.235" offset="700815">I think that the State's interests in having a proceeding that proceeds smoothly without episodes that render the proceedings potentially a mockery also are strong.</text>

            <text syncTime="146.844" offset="759225">But as you understand their position, would they accept Justice Scalia's formulation of what the rule ought to be or the formulation that his question proposed?</text>

            <text syncTime="160.170" offset="812515">It seems to me that their position is much more focused on the metes and bounds of what Faretta specifically recognized, which was requiring the defendant to comply with the rules and if there is a disorderly kind of behavior that would be sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.997" offset="871865">But I don't read their position to be that someone who is lacking in communications skills and coherent communications skills even on the record in the trial would be someone whose right of self representation could be overridden.</text>

            <text syncTime="186.637" offset="918363">What would happen if you started out with pro se representation and then the trial turned into a farce?</text>
            <text syncTime="194.658" offset="950441">Start over again, but he would have to accept counsel at that point?</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas M. Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="198.779" offset="966951">Well, it seems to me that we're in a world here where we don't really know what the precise rules would be because of the lack of clarity for the trial courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.401" offset="1001432">So I don't want to tell you exactly what the Indiana courts would do, but I would imagine that a trial judge would be faced with a decision based on how long the trial has gone on, what the level of complexity of the trial is, what the level of farce or taint could be for the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="222.495" offset="1061828">I'm sure under the old rule, if I can recall it the old rule, where you have a single standard for both the right to be tried... the... the ability to be tried and the right to represent yourself, there must have been instances in which the person who was representing himself was unable to cope and the trial was... was turning into a farce.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.943" offset="1159630">There must have been instances.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas M. Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="248.995" offset="1167780">Well, I think in the cases where this happened, whether it's because the trial was turned into a farce or because the defendant was excluded from the courtroom, as in Illinois v. Allen, I think the trial often proceeds.</text>

            <text syncTime="261.536" offset="1217935">But I guess what I'm suggests is that there is always going to be the possibility in terms of a discretionary judgment call, whether it's a systematic rule or whether it's something up to the trial judge, that the court may decide that in interest of fairness, that the... you know... all the... all that's gone on needs to be restarted, particularly if it hasn't gone on very far.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.181" offset="1292541">I don't mean to suggest a rule in that regard.</text>

            <text syncTime="420.000" offset="1851875">All we're suggesting is that once the defendant has made the choices that are forced upon him essentially by the trial, i.e., the decision to represent himself and the decision whether to present a defense or not, that he can actually carry that out; whatever it is that he wants to do within the rules of the court, that he has the capability of effectuating that.</text>

            <text syncTime="456.090" offset="1996175">That the judge instructs him: You're ill advised to proceed on your own; you're not a lawyer; this is, you know, a complicated process; are you sure you want to represent yourself?</text>

            <text syncTime="1043.016" offset="4343852">The question is whether a judge can also make that decision ex ante before the trial has begun and insist that the defendant be represented through counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="1182.575" offset="4902141">The competency threshold, as the Court has noted, is a minimal threshold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.293" offset="4916979">It is designed to ferret out whether the defendant has the minimal degree of rational understanding to assist his counsel and to understand what's happening.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.666" offset="4954490">And he then, if he wants to waive counsel, has to have a knowing and intelligent waiver, which means he has to understand what he's doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.505" offset="4985837">But those inquiries don't focus on whether he, in fact, could carry out the substantially more demanding task, both mentally and as far as the ability to communicate goes, of presenting a case to the jury during a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.431" offset="5045606">There are many examples of mentally ill defendants whose world views may be substantially skewed in many respects, but the competency threshold focuses on whether they can understand the case in front of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.572" offset="5094089">For example, if you have a defendant who is on trial for making certain specific threats against identified people, he may have the ability to understand what the charge is and to assist counsel in whether he said those things and what he intended by them, even if his world view in many respects is extremely skewed; he has paranoid delusions; and his ability to communicate coherently on his own is very diminished.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.389" offset="5205370">And that is why the competency threshold does not fully address the very important interest that a State has in presenting to the world that the trial is a fair one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.881" offset="5251346">This has both the dimension of actual fairness as well as perceived fairness because if the public sees the spectacle of a mentally ill defendant, who may well be able to cooperate with counsel and with the assistance of counsel get through a trial, attempt to communicate to the jury on his own in a very delusional way, it really casts the justice system into disrepute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1316.945" offset="5439637">It is well established now that if the defendant actually obstructs the proceeding, stands up out of order, disregards the judge's procedural rulings and in... violates the decorum of the courtroom, self representation can be terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.187" offset="5500554">And that, I think, is an important fact that establishes that the Faretta right is not an absolute right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.258" offset="5520825">But here we're talking about turning it into a farce in a different way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.893" offset="5535454">For example, in Colin Ferguson's trial for murder in New York, he got up, and he told the jury in his opening statement: I've been charged with 93 counts because it is the year 1993.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.368" offset="5581325">If it were the year 1928, I would have been charged with 28 counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.839" offset="5599192">And that doesn't violate the decorum of the room, but it really casts doubt on what is the State doing here: Putting somebody on trial, having them represent themselves with no lawyer, when that's the mental ability that they have to understand what's going on.</text>

            <text syncTime="1626.795" offset="6678990">The defendant has the choice whether to exercise a particular constitutional right or, as in Godinez, to present no defense whatsoever.</text>

            <text syncTime="1643.074" offset="6744087">And importantly, the accused does not surrender that control over his defense simply because the State's judgment is that he'd be better served by proceeding through counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.011" offset="6775852">To the contrary, a lawyer may speak for his client, not because he needs counsel, but only because he has consented to the representation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2154.982" offset="8791774">As I read that research, I first learned that actually the pro se defendants don't do a bad job of defending themselves.</text>

            <text syncTime="2168.759" offset="8846840">And so perhaps that eliminates some of the concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.344" offset="8861259">But the other thing that it tells me is that there is a small subclass of pro se defendants who may in fact do badly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.734" offset="8902742">And we have in front of us one of those individuals and that, therefore, a rule which permitted a State to deal with this subclass of disturbed people who want to represent themselves, who could communicate with counsel, but can't communicate with anybody else, that if we focus on that subclass and accept the State's argument here, interestingly enough, we've gone a long way to deal with a serious practical problem, and we've advanced the cause of seeing that individuals have a fair trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="3445.155" offset="13952420">I think here if you have a defendant where it might create a different question if there was some reliable that evidence that that might be true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.344" offset="13989201">But it would be hard to imagine that if a trial court would have to take the defendant's word for it entirely, that he would sit silent.</text>

            <text syncTime="3475.341" offset="14073210">Here I think you have got a defendant who, while competent at the time of trial, the day before, a few days before trial wrote a letter to the court saying: Dear Judge Hawkins, I want to extend the court power for training for this enormously wide defense to exercise also U.S. continent five as it becomes more advanced parts differently to structure First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.854" offset="14163281">Trial to do your best old man to isolate the young boy in me at this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.572" offset="14178118">So I think we have got a clear example of someone who could communicate with counsel as the Sena report indicated.</text>

            <text syncTime="3511.014" offset="14215944">I think even in the statements in open court you have got a lack of coherence and lack of understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.668" offset="14238513">And counsel was there, I think, to usher through some of those statements that made system somewhat comprehensible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.303" offset="14261083">But there's, I think, every reason for the court to look at these writings and to also fall back on what he had seen in open court to come to the conclusion that this was somebody who couldn't be relied phenomenon communicate coherently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.546" offset="14309984">I think relying on the Allen standard is a mistake for the additional reason in addition to not specifically covering this kind of scenario, it also might then lead to circumstances where trial courts are tightening up the Allen standard for all defendants whose wish to represent themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.655" offset="14370484">So even when you don't have concerns about this kind of competency, the courts are going to be in a position where they look at this Court's precedent and say, oh, we're supposed to enforce Allen strictly and we have got a rules violation, so therefore, we have to override the self representation request.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.415" offset="14437462">And I think that that's probably not what the Court would want to do just to provide that as a vehicle for dealing with dependents such as Ahmad Edwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.855" offset="14471212">Now, I think it is also important to bear in mind that... that we can speak about fairness in trial and the appearance of fairness in trial and not be speaking, strictly speaking about due process, about the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.460" offset="14509664">And that's the point of the wheat case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.928" offset="14515516">We don't have to think that the State's concerns for fairness are limited by the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.666" offset="14542474">We can acknowledge that there are other circumstances that courts... that trial courts in states can take into account when they are dealing with Sixth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.488" offset="14573821">And there, of course, it was the Sixth Amendment right--</text>
