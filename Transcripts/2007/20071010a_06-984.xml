            <text syncTime="1590.271" offset="6563901">Justice Scalia suggested that this wasn't self-executing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.508" offset="6588874">The State Department with respect to the Vienna Convention itself told Congress very clearly: You don't have to do anything; this is self-executing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.149" offset="6631402">And then the protocol says: We the United States agree to accept the jurisdiction of the ICJ in a certain class of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.005" offset="6674869">And Congress ratified that, too.</text>

            <text syncTime="1638.019" offset="6754909">So there didn't have to be legislation before Texas and its local officials were obligated to provide notice in this case; and of course, it's their default on that treat obligation by the State and local officials that has us in this predicament in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.528" offset="6808930">Now, there's another meaning of "self-executing", or maybe it's a misuse of the term, to say whether it gives rise to individually enforceable rights in court without more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.117" offset="6847278">And we do take the position that if the President had done nothing, and certainly if the President had said we're not going to comply, we're going to respond to this ICJ judgment the way we did with the Nicaragua judgment, we don't think that this judgment would be enforceable as of its own terms.</text>

            <text syncTime="2077.952" offset="8514621">So I would say that in some respects it's a fortiori that in this case what's at issue is simply recognizing that there's binding Federal law here, that I think if the Texas court had recognized that it was binding Federal law, it would have applied under their own State procedural default law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.628" offset="8573345">Now, just to finish up, and then I will sit down, there's a second part of your question, Justice Scalia, which was addressed to what does the reference to comity mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.632" offset="8605318">Obviously, from the very beginning in this case we have taken the position in this Court that the President's memorandum directs the State courts, in its words, to give effect to the Avena judgment... not decide whether you want to give it effect based on your State law of comity, but give effect to the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.827" offset="8674177">I think if you actually look at the law of comity, one of the things that it talks about is comity is really what the courts should do in the absence of a controlling view from one of the political branches.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.533" offset="8712943">Here the President has made clear, it's clear to me what the answer is applying comity, which would be to give effect to the judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2932.259" offset="11931856">But let me add a caveat to that, which is in both Breard and Sanchez-Llamas, this Court assumed the Vienna Convention created individual rights, and although Texas maintains that it did not create individual rights and the United States maintains that it did not create individual rights, we don't have to win on that proposition to prevail in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="4741.614" offset="19169237">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4742.847" offset="19174252">First, there is nothing in the ratification history that suggests that Avena made any assumptions about whether or not the Optional Protocol would be self-executing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4750.470" offset="19204659">The Connally Amendment went to the compulsory jurisdiction of the ICJ, and the discussion to which Texas has referred is entirely about the international ramifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="4758.491" offset="19236737">In fact, the Senate specifically declined to apply the Connally Amendment to the Optional Protocol.</text>
            <text syncTime="4763.627" offset="19257322">So that gets to the question that we have been discussing here, which is: What is the scope of the enforceability of an ICJ judgment?</text>
            <text syncTime="4769.614" offset="19281250">There are obviously constraints to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4771.799" offset="19290027">One is illustrated by the Chief Justice's hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="4774.251" offset="19299849">That is, there are affirmative constraints in the Constitution, itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4776.620" offset="19309253">The second is illustrated by a point I made, but Mr. Cruz misunderstood, which is that the nature of the obligation emanating from the judgment is directed at a constitutional branch such as the obligation to enforce an active statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4791.380" offset="19368394">Obviously, that is not enforceable in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4793.163" offset="19375500">If the nature of the obligation is to cease hostilities, that is obviously directed to the President and is not enforceable in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4799.116" offset="19399323">And that's illustrated by the Nicaragua case in which the ICJ issued a judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4803.270" offset="19415937">Congress passed a statute that said it wasn't going to comply; and the President said he wasn't going to comply.</text>
            <text syncTime="4807.639" offset="19433387">That, in turn, applies to the third constraint, which is the political constraint, itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4813.226" offset="19455748">The Nicaragua case illustrates that if the ICJ issues a judgment that the United States does not want to comply with, Congress can pass a statute to say we repudiate the obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4822.232" offset="19491797">So the obligations that we are talking about here in which the ICJ judgment would be enforceable by an individual fall squarely in the class of cases that this Court has decided for two centuries where an individual has a right conferred by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4837.076" offset="19551147">And he walked into a court, and he asked that court to enforce that right, and he invokes that right in... as in the Caffa core case, the Roucher case, cases going back to the founding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4847.133" offset="19591376">And this Court has said when the right is of a nature to be enforced in a court of justice, this Court will enforce it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4853.287" offset="19615931">And that is all Mr. Medellin is asserting here: The right to enforce a right that is eminently suitable for judicial enforcement because it goes to the judicial process, itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4862.659" offset="19653443">The second point with respect to Article III: It cannot be the case that this Court can never enforce... gives away its Article III authority when somebody else enforces a judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4872.349" offset="19692208">We know from the Comegys and the Abba cases that we have cited that the Court has in fact said that when the U.S. submits a case to international adjudication that international adjudication is binding and it's not reexaminable in a U.S. court.</text>

            <text syncTime="4886.341" offset="19748215">I read the Comegys case, however you say it, to be for the exact opposite proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4892.495" offset="19772770">There they were saying, this is an international arbitration, there's no reason to go behind it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4896.547" offset="19788966">But the question of whether or not that arbitration is binding in the bankruptcy proceeding that was at issue there was very much one for the U.S. Supreme Court to make.</text>

            <text syncTime="4906.069" offset="19827105">But that's because that was not part of what the court had actually decided, or rather that the international adjudication had actually decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="4913.575" offset="19857093">You think about, if the proposition is that nobody else but an Article III court can decide a Federal question, this Court could not have decided Mitsubishi.</text>
            <text syncTime="4921.395" offset="19888440">In Mitsubishi the Court sent Federal statute antitrust claims to an arbitration panel in Tokyo and said that the result would be everyone forcible so long as the panel actually took cognizance of the claim and actually decided it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4935.922" offset="19946536">This Court if it evaluated the claim that Mr. Medellin is entitled to review and reconsideration as a result of the treaty obligation under 94-1 and the President's determination that that treaty obligation will be given effect, this Court would be performing a supremely judicial function, that is it would be interpreting and applying Federal law in the form of a statute, which is exactly what the Supremacy Clause requests the Court to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="5053.627" offset="20417367">There's a treaty obligation under the Vienna Convention, which this court has now dispositively interpreted, and there's a treaty obligation to comply.</text>
            <text syncTime="5059.797" offset="20442027">And it's the very nature of an obligation to put a dispute to a third party that you may not agree with the result, and that does not in any way compromise this Court's Article III authority to rest that judgment on an obligation committed to by the political branches, three treaties ratified by the President and Senate that said when this country commits itself to do something we're going to do it.</text>

            <text syncTime="5156.378" offset="20828326">The ICJ made it clear that it had to be prospective, and one of the fundamental reasons for that is because the judgment says that the treaty rights has to be determined on its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="5168.102" offset="20875242">Mr. Medellin is entitled to show that the violation of the treaty standing on its own two feet and not filtered through a constitutional right affected... that he is entitled to show prejudice.</text>
