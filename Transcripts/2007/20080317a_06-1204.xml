            <text syncTime="78.547" offset="484461">Ultimately, after the assets were transferred from Switzerland to be held in escrow in the Philippines, the Philippine Supreme Court in 2003 issued a judgment relating to those assets because there was some doubt as to whether that judgment, some question about whether that judgment specifically addressed the Arelma assets that are at issue here, the Republic filed a motion before the Sandiganbayan in 2004 directed specifically at the assets.</text>

            <text syncTime="163.328" offset="823635">I think it would make sense logically to consider the issues that we think... there really are two related sets of considerations that should go into the Court's decision as to whether this suit should be dismissed, which is our submission.</text>

            <text syncTime="179.867" offset="889777">The second relates to kind of a broader set of considerations and I think that your question goes to those.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.413" offset="907958">So I'll turn first to the sovereign immunity question.</text>

            <text syncTime="190.005" offset="930319">Its, its submission is that President Marcos misappropriated them while he served as the president of the Republic.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.720" offset="961144">If that is true, then under Philippine law these assets at all times were the property of the Republic.</text>

            <text syncTime="225.287" offset="1071485">In fact, he thought it was a good thing for the Philippines that that litigation go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.815" offset="1105549">But if the government's position is the judgment would be uncollectible because all of those assets belonged to the Philippine Government and not to Marcos's estate, so the... that whole litigation would have been an exercise in futility.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld</label>
            <text syncTime="250.964" offset="1174198">Well, I think not, Justice Ginsburg, and I think that there is in fact no inconsistency at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.538" offset="1220487">The Republic's position at that time was that it had no objection to plaintiffs who were victims of the Marcos regime bringing suit in the United States and they had no... the Republic had no objection to the suit proceeding in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.815" offset="1265523">Specifically the issue that was before the court that the Republic weighed in on was whether the act of state doctrine would preclude adjudication in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.202" offset="1299168">The Republic's interest was in making clear that the acts of Marcos were not the acts of the Republic, they were not official acts that the Republic was prepared to defend.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.791" offset="1329470">The Republic did not then and does not now have any objection to citizens of the Republic proceeding in the courts of the United States against the estate of Marcos.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.928" offset="1362071">The question here is whether or not these assets are in the estate of Marcos.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.677" offset="1385059">The Republic's submission is that these assets belong to the Republic, that they have never been part of the Marcos estate, and that therefore these are sort of ships passing in the night, that there can be proceedings against the estate in this country or elsewhere.</text>

            <text syncTime="318.749" offset="1445349">There is litigation going on in the Philippines now before the Sandiganbayan as to what is in the estate, and I think that one of the problems, of course, is that, as is true of many corrupt regimes that have misappropriated state assets, unraveling it is enormously complicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.553" offset="1516507">There were dummy corporations, there were smell corporations, which is one of the reasons that it has taken so long.</text>

            <text syncTime="346.253" offset="1555377">Is it the position of the Philippine Government that there are any assets in the estate that the Philippine Government does not claim?</text>

            <text syncTime="372.523" offset="1660389">So the position of the Philippines, going back to Justice Ginsburg's question, was we have no objection and in fact I think it was we support the litigation in the United States, but when it comes time to collect a judgment we're claiming they don't get a penny because everything belongs to us.</text>

            <text syncTime="393.234" offset="1743250">I think... and again let me say that there are two separate questions: One is whether or not, as a matter of principle, the Philippines objected to its citizens proceeding in the courts of the United States to condemn the regime of former President Marcos.</text>

            <text syncTime="455.912" offset="1993921">I think that there was real meaning to the judgment that was returned here even if there is a dispute as to whether there are assets in the Marcos estate.</text>

            <text syncTime="486.071" offset="2114607">Ultimately that was vetoed by the Sandiganbayan as inconsistent with Philippine law.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.524" offset="2128399">But I think that the executive branch--</text>

            <text syncTime="494.318" offset="2147625">Then why doesn't the Republic take the position that, because that was vetoed for reasons apart from the Republic's discretion, that the current assets would be an appropriate source of payment?</text>

            <text syncTime="735.176" offset="3111021">And when the assets are gone, to reclaim them, even if the Sandiganbayan rules next week that Arelma is now and always has been the property of the Republic, it will be as a practical matter impossible to get them back.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.483" offset="3156265">One suggestion which is made by Respondent and by some of its amici is that, because the Republic is not bound here, it could bring an action against the former stakeholder of these assets, Merrill Lynch.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.119" offset="3214780">That, I think, is also clearly an inadequate remedy for the Republic.</text>

            <text syncTime="769.819" offset="3249575">And if what we are looking for under Rule 19... again, there are sort of two components to this: There is the sovereign immunity component, which we think is essentially a per se rule requiring dismissal in circumstances here.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.706" offset="3305163">If we get beyond that and we say, under Rule 19 what are the interests that we want to advance, the principal interest of Rule 19 is that everything gets accommodated in a single proceeding, that this gets resolved by the whole, as the Court has described it, and the only way to accomplish that is dismissal of this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.933" offset="3362006">If this action is dismissed, the court's judgment that the Republic is an indispensable party in litigation relating to Arelma will be binding on all the participants to this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.819" offset="3409549">That will mean that if anybody sues the former stakeholder Merrill Lynch in the future, that action will be dismissed unless or until the Republic chooses.</text>

            <text syncTime="847.725" offset="3561163">It is then in a position to go to Merrill Lynch and say: This is our account; give it to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.662" offset="3576941">If Merrill Lynch declines to do that, it is true the Republic will have to seek judicial action in the United States, but at that point it will be seeking to enforce a judgment of the Sandiganbayan.</text>

            <text syncTime="3496.590" offset="14156638">A couple of points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.136" offset="14162907">First of all, there is no doubt that the Republic has a substantial interest in the assets that are at stake here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.648" offset="14184954">And, therefore, its sovereign immunity, at least in the context of this case, should be dispositive and should have led to dismissal under Rule 19.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.318" offset="14211599">There... this Court in the Provident case noted that there are certain compelling, substantive considerations that are dispositive under Rule 19 that make it unnecessary to consider any other balancing consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.141" offset="14270845">Sovereign immunity is one such consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.328" offset="14279622">And because the Republic has immunity, has asserted immunity--</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="3530.359" offset="14291743">You agree that the Ninth Circuit gave sovereign immunity great weight in the balancing?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_a_rothfeld" startTime="3533.888" stopTime="3664.994">
            <label>Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld</label>
            <text syncTime="3533.888" offset="14305849">--I think it gave it no weight at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.951" offset="14310133">I think it said that, yes, in theory, sovereign immunity is entitled to weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.043" offset="14322463">But in this case we are going to ignore it completely because we believe that if the Republic appears in New York and asserts its interests, it will lose under statute of limitation grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.305" offset="14355482">That is a completely inappropriate way of treating it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.102" offset="14362692">Once the sovereign immunity was asserted and there was a substantial interest in the asset here, as there undoubtedly was, that should have been the end of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.801" offset="14389545">The second point is there is no question that, ultimately, this is a dispute between the Marcos estate and the Republic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.564" offset="14412533">There is no question that the claims of the Respondents here are entirely derivative of the Marcos estate; and, therefore, that is something that has to be decided first: Whether this belongs to the estate, the Respondents, or the Republic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.998" offset="14462270">And that is a determination that should be made in the courts of the Philippines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.496" offset="14476272">It is not a question of surrendering the jurisdiction of U.S. courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.136" offset="14482855">There is a general consensus that stolen assets, assets stolen by corrupt leaders, should be returned to the nation of origin, and determination as to ownership should be made by the courts of that nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.898" offset="14533950">That's stated on the U.N. Convention on Corruption to which the U.S. and the Philippines are a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.865" offset="14549728">All of the nations that have an interest in the relevant assets, not only the Republic but the United States and Switzerland, all agreed that it is appropriate for the Sandiganbayan to make that determination as between the Republic and the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.297" offset="14591524">If it's ruled for the estate, the Respondent can attempt to collect as a judgment creditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.217" offset="14607198">If it goes to the Republic, the Republic can assert its interest directly with Merrill Lynch as the owner of Arelma.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.903" offset="14629976">If Merrill Lynch declines to pay, it can in a number of ways try to enforce its... either with the assistance of the United States according to U.S. statute, in which case the Sandiganbayan's factual determinations would be dispositive, or it can bring an action under... under New York law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.116" offset="14694760">That is the only way in which there could be a single proceeding that resolves everybody's interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.098" offset="14714718">In this proceeding, as all agree, the Republic is free, for whatever it is actually worth, to sue Merrill Lynch.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.673" offset="14736974">That is precisely what Rule 19 is designed to avoid, duplicative litigation, the possibility of duplicative liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.249" offset="14759335">If the Sandiganbayan rules, the Republic comes here and initiates an action, everybody who has a claim can be brought into that action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.981" offset="14794234">As Justice Ginsburg noted, there is no possibility that Merrill Lynch could be subjected to duplicative liability because this Court's judgment would determine that the Republic is an indispensable party.</text>
