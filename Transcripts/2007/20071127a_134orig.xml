            <label>Mr. H. Bartow Farr, III</label>
            <text syncTime="13.664" offset="222454">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Although the 1905 Compact between Delaware and New Jersey did not settle the boundary dispute between them, New Jersey nevertheless agreed to dismiss the suit that it had filed before this Court to determine the boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.579" offset="302075">And the reason for those two seemingly contradictory facts, I think, is because the Compact did resolve permanently certain issues of jurisdiction, implementing rules that could be administered without regard to where the boundary was.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.975" offset="379607">Thus in particular Article VII, the provision of the Compact that's particularly at issue in this case, provided that each State could continue to exercise its traditional riparian authority over the riparian owners on its side of the river according to its laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.374" offset="461213">Now, the Special Master I think fundamentally changed the nature of the Compact by superimposing the boundary line into the terms of an agreement that was meant to operate without it.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.714" offset="514608">And I think he did so because he mistakenly applied the presumption that all promises with respect to jurisdiction and territory must be unmistakable; and this Court, however, had said several years before, in Virginia versus Maryland, that that presumption simply is not applicable to compacts that are entered into when the boundaries between the States are disputed.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="116.280" offset="632890">Mr. Farr, one of the striking things about this Compact is that to the extent that it is definite, there is a lot in here in detail about service arrests on the river and about fishing, but then you get to these two articles at the end and they certainly don't have that same definite detailed quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.826" offset="787013">As I read the Article VII that you're stressing, it says... let's see... "may continue to exercise".</text>
            <text syncTime="167.944" offset="839571">So it seems to me that "may continue to" was just whatever was the status quo, that will continue; not to do anything dispositive, just whatever was will continue.</text>

            <text syncTime="181.705" offset="894533">Well, several things about that, Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.501" offset="905713">First of all I think that the language "continue to" necessarily brings in the historical antecedents of regulation of riparian matters by both States.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.009" offset="951793">It's undisputed in this case that on New Jersey's side of the river, that is with respect to riparian owners on the New Jersey side, New Jersey had exercised full and exclusive authority over, for example, wharfing out to navigable water, the building of piers and wharfs to do that, the granting of lands, without any involvement whatsoever by Delaware.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="219.172" offset="1044475">Was it clear that New Jersey believed when it had authorized somebody to wharf out, that the person who wharfed out was not subject to New Jersey's environmental laws?</text>

            <text syncTime="241.633" offset="1134337">--if it... if it would have been subject to New Jersey's environmental laws, had New Jersey owned the bed of the river into which the wharf was extended, by parity of reasoning it seems to me the wharf would be subject to Delaware's environmental laws if Delaware owns the bed of the river.</text>

            <text syncTime="262.449" offset="1217510">I think without the Compact that would be true, but I think what the Compact is saying is that you get to retain the degree of power on your own side of the river that you had before, without regard ultimately to where the boundary is determined to be.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="278.132" offset="1280309">So your... your argument... it seems to me it's not that easy, because your argument is assuming that by virtue of the "may continue" language, the State of New Jersey acquires a new power, and the new power in effect is to... is to make grants of subaqueous land that belonged not to New Jersey but to Delaware, and that's the stretch.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.263" offset="1372782">It... it seems to me that that is such an extraordinary position or proposition, that you've got to have something more specific than "may continue" in order to construe that as meaning an agreement which was intended to give New Jersey the power to grant away Delaware land.</text>

            <text syncTime="322.490" offset="1457733">Well, Justice Souter, I think that the difficulty with that question is it assumes knowledge of where the boundary is.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.238" offset="1488662">In other words, when one talks about New Jersey getting a new power to grant lands that are within Delaware, that is a... that is a question that necessarily assumes that the boundary has to be part of that understanding.</text>

            <text syncTime="345.777" offset="1550833">No, I'm simply saying that your position... and I accept your position... that the Compact is intended to continue to operate whether or not the boundary is... is ultimately determined, and if so, after it is ultimately determined... and once we get to that point of continuing to operate after, then necessarily the only way it can operate on your theory is to give New Jersey the power to grant Delaware land.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.796" offset="1670892">And if New Jersey has that power, it must have been a power that was intended in the 1905 Compact, and that intent strikes me as a very extraordinary intent; and... and my... the point of my question was the application of the Compact in the new circumstances, as you claim it to be, would be so extraordinary that you ought to have language more specific than "may continue" in order to establish that extraordinary result.</text>

            <text syncTime="420.262" offset="1848838">Because New Jersey does not... I presume New Jersey does not have law, for example, in its constitution, providing that it can grant Delaware land.</text>

            <text syncTime="436.363" offset="1913204">It did have provision for granting laws beyond the low-water mark in New Jersey.</text>

            <text syncTime="475.755" offset="2070774">In order to exercise that power, it had to possess certain attributes, i.e., land.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.204" offset="2100554">Once it lost that land, it had nothing to exercise the power over.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.234" offset="2120720">In fact, it had a little bit left.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.810" offset="2126990">It had the distance between the high and the low-water marks, so it still had the power.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.731" offset="2146634">But the... the recognition of the power in 1905 was, in effect, a formula; and the formula depends on facts to be applied; and the facts changed once the boundary was determined.</text>

            <text syncTime="2476.682" offset="10074484">In 1867 in New Jersey, Attorney General Robeson issued a very lengthy and scholarly opinion on the difference between the powers that a State could exercise over riparian rights, and he distinguished in that opinion between what he called the great public uses, which would be for defense, for the environment, for protection of the people's safety, and what were deemed to be public uses.</text>

            <text syncTime="3470.786" offset="14050947">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.048" offset="14059933">May I just say two things, and, first of all, something that we haven't really talked about this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.140" offset="14080309">With respect to matters of nuisance and all, Federal law provides a substantial array of laws: The Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the Coastal Zone Management Act, the Rivers and Harbors Act, all of those things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.944" offset="14143525">Anything built out from New Jersey has to undergo Federal review; and, subject to the Compact, Delaware has rights to participate at that Federal level.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.660" offset="14178425">So what we are talking about here, and what the bill of complaint deals with, is the question of whether Delaware can do what it did here, which is apply its State law enacted under its police power to say that a proposed project, riparian project, for the New Jersey side is impermissible and cannot be built.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.919" offset="14267450">So we are dealing just with the law of State versus State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.791" offset="14282915">Now... so I'd like to suggest if... if we put ourselves in the shoes of the Commissioners who were negotiating this Compact in 1905, what is the likely reaction if Article VII... if, now, Delaware had proposed at the time that, instead of the language as it is now, at the end of Article VII the words were added</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.488" offset="14369746">"subject to the police power of the other State? "</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.783" offset="14382911">New Jersey obviously would have had the reaction to that that that is something that depends on the boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.374" offset="14417288">There is no chance that New Jersey is going to be able to exercise any police power on the Delaware side, because there is no boundary dispute that would involve that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.243" offset="14448740">So this would essentially be a one-way veto that Delaware would be trying to add to the contract to say: Could we... we'll be able to override any riparian structure under our police power.</text>
