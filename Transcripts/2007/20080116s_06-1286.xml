            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104636">I have our opinion today in case 06-1286, Knight versus Commissioner of Internal Revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.954" offset="132430">The petitioner in this case is the trustee of a trust holding the proceeds of the sale of the Pepperidge Farm Company to Campbell Soup.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.168" offset="165240">The trustee had hired an investment advisor to manage the trust assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.083" offset="184884">On its tax return for the year 2000, the trust claimed a full deduction for the fees it paid the investment advisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.787" offset="215709">Now, under the tax code, individuals may claim deductions for certain items, including investment advisory fees on their tax returns, but only to the extent those deductions exceed 2% of their adjusted gross income.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.134" offset="273074">Tax lawyers call this the 2% floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.654" offset="287180">The code generally treats deductions claimed by trust the same way it treats those claimed by individuals as subject to this 2% floor, but there is an exception and it is that exception that gives rise to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.498" offset="342559">If a cost incurred by a trust "would not have been incurred if the property were held by an individual" rather than in trust, the expense is not subject to the 2% floor, but is fully deductible.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.200" offset="397416">The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit decided in this case that investment advisory fees incurred by a trust are subject to the 2% floor because the only costs that are fully deductible are those that could not be incurred by individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.093" offset="460946">This reading of the statute is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.362" offset="470037">The statute asks whether the cost would have been incurred, not whether they could have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.147" offset="493129">If Congress had intended the Court of Appeals’ reading, it easily could have replaced would with could and presumably would have.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.641" offset="527193">[Laughter]</text>
            <text syncTime="107.025" offset="532731">The trustee argues that the exception to the 2% floor applies whenever a trust incurs an expense because the property is subject -- because – because the subject property is held in trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.843" offset="579960">But on this view, every trust expense would be fully deductible allowing the exception to swallow the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.135" offset="609113">More to the point, the statute does not ask whether a particular cost is incurred because property is held in trust, rather, it asks what would happen if the property were not held in trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.714" offset="659477">Other lower courts have held -- have read the statute to ask whether a particular cost would commonly be incurred if the trust property were held by an individual rather than by a trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.926" offset="708274">Now while we found the Second Circuit's approach too restrictive and petitioner's approach too broad, we find this approach to be just right.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.997" offset="744532">In asking whether a particular cost would have been incurred if the property were held by an individual, the statute asks us to make a prediction about what would happen if a fact were changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.295" offset="793746">When you make a prediction in such a case, you try to figure out what would commonly or usually happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.767" offset="823630">It is certainly common for individuals to incur investment advisory fees and so the similar fees incurred by the trust are subject to the 2% floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.672" offset="867307">Now, we recognize that our test may not be the easiest to apply in other cases, but it is the test that the statute requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.085" offset="900953">And we have no authority to amend statutes simply because we might find an alternative, easier – easier to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.972" offset="932509">We affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals, but for reasons different from those given by that Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.010" offset="956646">Our opinion is unanimous.</text>
