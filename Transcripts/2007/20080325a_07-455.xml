            <text syncTime="9.086" offset="177920">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question in this case is whether a panel of the Ninth Circuit was correct when it added the words 844 of Title 18, and we think for at least four reasons, the answer to that question is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.967" offset="301427">First, and principally, those words are not in the statute that Congress wrote, and this Court has said many times that courts should not add words or elements to criminal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.650" offset="348238">Second, Congress knows how to include a relational element when it wants to, and in fact, did that in section 924(c) after which section 844 is otherwise patterned.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.910" offset="397244">And that shows that when Congress chose to leave 844 it did that intentionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.702" offset="428382">Third, when section 844 was amended in 1988, one court of appeals, the only court of appeals to rule directly on the question of whether there was a relationship between the carrying of explosives in the commission of a felony, had held that there was no relational element.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.212" offset="494420">Congress was on notice of that fact--</text>

            <text syncTime="90.868" offset="505078">Your argument relies on the notion that the word "during" in the statute is solely temporal.</text>

            <text syncTime="120.761" offset="624614">On the other hand, when Congress in... in 924(c) said "during and in relation to", it meant something more than a temporal relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.521" offset="663693">It did not say the same thing in 844, and it failed to say the same thing in 844(f) or the amended 924(c).</text>

            <text syncTime="174.984" offset="841535">If the felony is the filing of a dishonest tax return and... and you have a can of gasoline with you when you mail the letter, it seems to me quite as absurd as saying wearing a wristwatch in the course of a felony.</text>

            <text syncTime="311.431" offset="1387285">There were some evidentiary problems; a great deal of the evidence to support that count did not, in fact, come until almost literally the eve of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.065" offset="1429917">A lot of it came from overseas.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.175" offset="1438276">The count to which the... the 844... the crime to which 844 was, in fact, attached, the making of a false statement, was, to use a colloquialism, a lead-pipe cinch.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.371" offset="1503060">He had clearly made a false statement.</text>

            <text syncTime="346.741" offset="1528555">That prosecutor's decision, in fact, was a very responsible one, because what was shown when they opened his trunk was that this was a very dangerous person; and they wanted to bring a charge on which they were sure to convict him, so that his carrying of the explosive would get him ten years in addition to that charge.</text>

            <text syncTime="393.032" offset="1713711">My understanding is that district judges do not and cannot be involved in plea bargain negotiations; they can look at a plea before it is entered.</text>
