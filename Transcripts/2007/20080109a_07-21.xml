            <text syncTime="23.948" offset="275170">Those Indiana voters who lack the identification now required by the new photo ID law must overcome substantial practical and financial burdens before they can continue to exercise their constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.856" offset="326788">Now, the State says that those burdens are justified by the need to stamp out the scourge of voter impersonation fraud at the polls, but this Court has made clear many times that such a justification should not just be accepted at face value, but instead it should be scrutinized to assure that the claimed State interest is both real and sufficiently weighty to justify the burden being imposed on constitutional rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="265.635" offset="1241909">The Court said it doesn't really matter because the State agency that had associational standing in Hunt functioned for all purposes as the representatives of those, of those apple farmers, but there was no formal membership organization, no members per se at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.661" offset="1298020">But the Court said that shouldn't make a difference because there's really no actual functional difference between the two situations.</text>

            <text syncTime="349.991" offset="1579411">So that that... there is specific standing evidence in there of specific people who, much more than just your average voter, are active in party affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.780" offset="1618490">They may not have a... be card carrying members of the Democratic Party, but they are as much a part of the Democratic Party as anybody possibly could be, who were identified in response to interrogatories, about 9 or 10 of them, and were found to be satisfactory for purposes of standing by the district court on the equal protection claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.775" offset="1694455">Now, in addition I would note as I suggested to Justice Souter, you don't have to go to the associational standing because the Democratic Party clearly is injured in its own right as an organization.</text>

            <text syncTime="2835.182" offset="11520153">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Any system of voting that involves registrations or precincts will necessarily require some mechanism for ascertaining a voter's identity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.772" offset="11562471">Accordingly Petitioners cannot take issue that the constitutionality of some mechanism for ascertaining voter ID.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.460" offset="11589220">And I take it from today's argument that they would concede the constitutionality of a signature match requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.231" offset="11616283">Likewise, nobody can really dispute the proposition that a government issued photo ID is an awfully good way of verifying someone's identity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.535" offset="11645540">So the dispute really boils down to, in a system where the States can legitimately ask for some kind of basis to ascertain ID, can they insist on a particularly good one, the photo ID?</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.259" offset="11688486">And we would suggest that there's nothing in the First or Fourteenth Amendments that precludes that from happening.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.230" offset="11708339">Now, with respect to the nature of this challenge, I think one thing that's very evident from the questions is this was a challenge that was brought to the statute on its face and was brought before there was any enforcement of the statute or any significant enforcement of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.839" offset="11766748">Now, I would respectfully suggest that there's a better way to test the constitutionality of these statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2902.910" offset="11791095">Before you do that, General Clement, I'd like to you to concentrate on the one group of people where I think you can make a facial challenge and may not all speculating, and that's the indigent people who can't get... don't have the photo ID.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.403" offset="11848982">They don't drive, and they can't get up the money to get the birth certificate or whatever else.</text>

            <text syncTime="2963.781" offset="12034556">I don't know why that's a basis for a facial challenge though.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.133" offset="12047930">In particular, I think if you look at the Plaintiffs, the individual members, if they are members of the Indiana party that have been identified, they've certainly identified people who do not have the ID currently.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.308" offset="12096623">I'm not sure that they were specific as to whether they were indigent or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.025" offset="12111460">I'm not sure the individuals, the nine individuals, were really parsed out that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.963" offset="12131209">And I would think the far better way to go about dealing with that issue is to take as a starting point... I mean you pointed out that there were 32 provisional ballots cast in the Marion County election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.869" offset="12170915">Now, I gather from the State that's something like 0.02 percent of the ballots cast.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.506" offset="12189410">So it suggests that this is not a monumental problem, but those 32 provisional ballots seem to me to be 32 possible plaintiffs with a much more concrete case--</text>

I don't know for sure... I would imagine that the State would probably put on some evidence that says, look, there's a reason we did it that way; we piggybacked on the general provisional ballot provisions and what we decided is that, if we had people executing indigency affidavits at the polling place, it would add to the lines as the the polls.</text>

            <text syncTime="3495.523" offset="14161446">Let me start by addressing the question of what reasonable alternatives there are to the strict law that we are dealing with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.776" offset="14186523">This is the most strict law in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.378" offset="14196868">And what you have when you look at the range of laws that are out there in other States is a very different set of responses that occur when a voter shows up without an ID in hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.417" offset="14237096">In Michigan and several other States, for example, the response is to say: All right, we are going to make you fill out an affidavit attesting to who you are, and that you are a registered voter; that you live in this precinct; and we'll let you go ahead and vote a regular ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.892" offset="14286938">That in those States they... they consider that a sufficient safeguard while looking at the IDs of all the people who have the IDs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.648" offset="14317971">In Florida they have a different approach, which is to let you vote a provisional ballot, and then what they do is they judge your signature match later on in exactly the same process that's used for absentee ballots.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.988" offset="14371366">We have a lot of information in this record about why it's okay to have absentee ballots allowed without an ID in Indiana, and they say, well, we have these specialized committees that know how to do signature matches; and they are trained; and so we get thousands of these absentee ballots in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.298" offset="14424551">But we can very carefully scrutinize them.</text>

            <text syncTime="3601.256" offset="14584420">This Court has never looked at these issues on an as applied basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.994" offset="14599362">The Burdick test, in its very nature, is about facial weighing of systemic benefits and burdens from the particular rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.664" offset="14630082">And there is a reason for that, because the concern is systemic; that the burdens that are being imposed, a whole range of them depending on the kind of people involved and their particular circumstances, will have an effect on the outcome of the election overall.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.173" offset="14684104">Imagine, if you will, what it would be like to try to have all these class actions being brought, some by the people who don't have IDs, some by the people who have IDs but don't have enough money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.196" offset="14720153">You would have to figure out exactly how much money people are allowed to have in order to be in this exempt class.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.100" offset="14743767">The courts would then be creating exempt classes, trying to decide whether the legislature would have wanted an exemption drawn or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.671" offset="14770099">The whole thing would be a complete and utter morass.</text>
            <text syncTime="3652.491" offset="14789325">And, ultimately, even if you did carve out an exception for indigent people or for some other group of people, you ultimately would leave untouched the real problem, which is the concern that even for people who are relatively... suffer relatively minor inconvenience, maybe one percent of them are not going to show up and vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3669.434" offset="14857139">And that's exactly what the legislature may have been trying to accomplish here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3673.138" offset="14871976">So that is not the way the jurisprudence in this area ever looks at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3677.773" offset="14890471">Nobody applied the poll... nobody challenged the poll tax as applied.</text>

            <text syncTime="3699.206" offset="14976257">That's our... our analysis, and I think it's certainly completely consistent with every decision right up through Klingman a couple of years ago.</text>

            <text syncTime="3721.153" offset="15064028">Well, you have to make some judgment about the incremental, additional benefit above what's already been in place for decades, and it worked extremely effectively, Your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="3756.809" offset="15206657">Why don't we do that weighing of benefits and burdens of increments versus needs?</text>
