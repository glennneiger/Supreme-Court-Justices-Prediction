            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104719">I have the opinion of the Court in case 06-1287, CSX Transportation versus Georgia State Board of Equalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.377" offset="142126">In 1976, Congress passed an act to prevent States from discriminating against railroads by taxing railroad property more heavily than other commercial property in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.958" offset="188520">In a prior case, we held that this statute, popularly known as the 4-R Act, permits a railroad to challenge a State's valuation of its property for tax purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.649" offset="235227">States can discriminate by applying higher tax rates to railroads or less blatantly by over valuing railroad property compared to other property.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.981" offset="276605">Now, in that earlier case, the railroad challenged only how the state applied its method for figuring out the value of railroad property rather than the method itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.468" offset="322580">We had no occasion, therefore, to decide whether the statute permits railroads to dispute the underlying valuation methods chosen by the State, thatâ€™s the question presented by today's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.950" offset="376497">CSX Transportation is a freight rail carrier with multiple routes across the State of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.438" offset="402410">In 2002, Georgia charged CSX almost 50% more in property taxes than it had the previous year.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.203" offset="437519">CSX sued under the 4-R Act, claiming that Georgia had dramatically overvalued its in-state rail property by changing the valuation methods it used to assess their property.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.003" offset="488719">The District Court ruled for Georgia, a divided panel of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.539" offset="514841">Both courts reasoned that the 4-R Act does not allow railroads to challenge the State's valuation methods, but only the application of those methods.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.459" offset="554548">In an opinion filed today with the clerk, we reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.235" offset="569594">The text of the act draws no distinction between valuation methods and the application of those methods.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.849" offset="596030">Instead, the act clearly prevents States from taxing railroad property at a ratio of assessed to true market value that is higher than the comparable ratio for other commercial and industrial property in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.917" offset="656321">In order to perform that required comparison, courts must calculate the true market value of railroad property and in order to do that, they must be able to look behind the State's choice of valuation methods.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.125" offset="713163">We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.677" offset="723403">Our opinion is unanimous.</text>
