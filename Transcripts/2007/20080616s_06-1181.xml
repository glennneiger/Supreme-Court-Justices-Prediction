            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104726">Justice Kennedy has our opinion this morning in 06-1181, Dada versus Mukasey, which will be announced by Justice Stevens.</text>

            <text syncTime="9.732" offset="143596">Samson Dada, petitioner in this case and a citizen of Nigeria, overstayed his temporary visa. The Department of Homeland Security sought petitioner's removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.087" offset="193020">As an alternative to involuntary removal, petitioner requested voluntary departure.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.005" offset="224680">This is a form of discretionary relief that allows certain favored aliens to leave the country willingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.954" offset="252475">This option gives the alien certain advantages.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.569" offset="266999">The Immigration Judge found petitioner removable, but granted the request for voluntary departure.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.527" offset="290822">Two days before expiration of the voluntary departure period, petitioner moved to reopen his deportation proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.709" offset="323528">Later, the BIA denied the motion to reopen because petitioner had overstayed his departure period.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.814" offset="351949">The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.237" offset="365637">We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict among the Circuits regarding whether the filing of a motion to reopen automatically tolls the voluntary departure period pending the motion's disposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.468" offset="422584">In an opinion for the Court filed today and authored by Justice Kennedy, we hold that the automatic tolling is not available.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.893" offset="452259">Tolling would fundamentally alter the voluntary departures quid pro quo between the Government and the alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.513" offset="478695">It would allow the alien to remain in the United States, but give the Government no benefit in return, but we also cannot accept the Government's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.934" offset="516416">The Government urges that Congress intended that the alien, an alien granted voluntary departure must relinquish the statutory right to seek -- to seek reopening.Un</text>
            <text syncTime="114.103" offset="561137">der the Government's view an alien granted voluntary departure, but whose circumstances have changed in a manner cognizable on a motion to reopen, has two unappealing choices.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.641" offset="607217">One, he or she can leave the United States in accordance with the voluntary departure order, but the motion to reopen will be deemed withdrawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.257" offset="645670">Two, if the alien wishes to pursue reopening and remains in the United States to do so, he or she risks the expiration of the statutory period and ineligibility for adjustment of status, the underlying relief sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.055" offset="704915">This poor choice cannot be reconciled with the plain text of a motion to reopen statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.932" offset="728426">It guarantees to each alien the right to file "one motion to reopen proceedings under this section" and nothing in the statutes or past use for past usage with respect to voluntary departure indicates it cannot coexist with the motion to reopen.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.419" offset="802300">Particularly where the plain text reveals no limitation, we must be reluctant to assume that Congress intended to remove for a protective class of aliens a safeguard as important as the motion to reopen.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.260" offset="861755">Accordingly, we hold that an alien granted voluntary departure should be permitted to unilaterally withdraw that election.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.530" offset="890803">That request must be made before the departure period expires.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.825" offset="907939">This approach, while by no means, the only solution to the untenable conflict between the voluntary departure scheme and the motion to reopen, avoids both the quixotic results of the Government's proposal and the elimination of benefits to the Government that would follow from petitioner's tolling rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.224" offset="985575">This petitioner requested withdrawal of his motion for voluntary departure prior to expiration of the 30-day departure period.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.350" offset="1022042">The BIA should have granted this request.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.202" offset="1033431">We find this same mistake implicit in the Court of Appeals' decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.199" offset="1053493">We, therefore, reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.868" offset="1084109">Justice Scalia has filed a dissenting opinion which the Chief Justice and Justice Thomas have joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.920" offset="1112321">Justice Alito has also filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
