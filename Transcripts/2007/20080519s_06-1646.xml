            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104677">You can see how anxious I am to make this announcement.[Laughter]</text>
            <text syncTime="3.424" offset="118365">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.346" offset="129964">Respondent Rodriquez was convicted of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.375" offset="150130">Under the Arms Career Criminal Act, he faced a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years if he had three previous convictions for a violent felony or serious drug offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.665" offset="191299">At issue here is whether two of respondents, three convictions in Washington state court for delivery of a controlled substance were serious drug offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.268" offset="225676">Serious drug offenses are defined as drug trafficking offenses "for which a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years or more is prescribed by law".</text>
            <text syncTime="39.562" offset="262875">Under Washington law, the maximum sentence for delivery of a controlled substance was five years for a first offence but 10 years for subsequent offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.858" offset="300073">Thus, under these Washington statutes, respondent could have been sentenced to 10 years for the two convictions in questions but the sentencing court did not impose the maximum term.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.046" offset="340824">The Ninth Circuit held that these convictions did not qualify as serious drug offenses because the maximum term of imprisonment should be determined without reference to recidivist enhancements.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.570" offset="386904">Contrary to the Ninth Circuit's holding, however, the convictions in question fall within the literal meaning of the definition of the serious drug offense, that is they were drug offenses for which a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years was prescribed by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.661" offset="443224">For this reason and others set out an opinion filed today with the clerk, we reversed the decision of the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.002" offset="468615">Justice Souter has filed the dissenting opinion in which Justice Stevens and Ginsburg have joined.</text>
