            <text syncTime="9.823" offset="210790">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Ninth Circuit held that no discrimination against a public employee is prohibited by the Equal Protection Clause unless the targeted person is a member of the suspect class or exercises a fundamental right.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.192" offset="268260">No matter how outrageous or evil and no matter how unrelated to any legitimate government interest, the clause provides zero protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.622" offset="301905">This theory is contrary to the Constitution's text.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.985" offset="315384">It is inconsistent with this Court's precedents.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.543" offset="325624">It is unworkable and is unnecessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.701" offset="338268">The Ninth Circuit ignored the Equal Protection Clause's guarantee to any person that the State will not use its vast powers to discriminate without a legitimate government purpose and particularly not in ways that lead to inefficient government.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.335" offset="392811">This Court has articulated three principles that control this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.491" offset="409425">First, the Constitution protects the individual from irrational discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.093" offset="431786">Second, the Fourteenth Amendment applies to public employers and rational-basis review applies to public employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.718" offset="462297">And third, the clause applies to the administrative actions of State officials, not just legislatures.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="79.012" offset="487479">Rational-basis review normally doesn't inquire into the actual motive, for example, of the State legislators who impose such a tax or impose such a restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.053" offset="547665">We simply ask: Could there have been a rational basis for this?</text>
            <text syncTime="99.505" offset="569504">Now, are you willing to abide by that test?</text>

            <text syncTime="102.706" offset="582251">The Ninth Circuit below said no rational-basis test ever; and, indeed, the trial in this case allowed the government to articulate any rationale, conceivable or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.060" offset="623734">We do think, even though it doesn't make--</text>

            <text syncTime="116.670" offset="638153">Not whether you could decide that, given all of the facts of this case, the criticism of the co-workers and all of that, whether it is conceivable to say that this was done on a rational basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.615" offset="701892">That isn't the rational-basis test.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.052" offset="711610">It's just sitting back without these factual inquiries, just as we don't inquire factually into why the State legislature acted, just asking: Could there have been a rational basis for the dismissal of this employee?</text>

            <text syncTime="148.576" offset="765735">--Your Honor, we do agree that that last part, Justice Scalia, looking at could there have been a rational basis, is the proper test.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.089" offset="799799">But that is a factual determination at some level that, as this Court in Kimel and a variety of other cases has said, that you still have to look to the underlying facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.162" offset="836057">And even the Solicitor General doesn't disagree at page 5 of their brief when they say you have to look to whether... that whatever that rationale is, it is supported by the record.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="177.393" offset="880988">So that what you do in this case... I mean the person is fired and that's all you know.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.987" offset="899378">And so you go back and see: Well, is there any possible reason?</text>
            <text syncTime="184.439" offset="909200">So you look at the time sheets.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.828" offset="914738">Oh, here are a few days where she punched in late.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.436" offset="925187">That's a possible reason, and that's enough?</text>

            <text syncTime="190.921" offset="935113">--Well, we do think that that can be enough; and, indeed, that's what the government had their opportunity to argue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.730" offset="962385">The Ninth Circuit, of course, cuts off even that very deferential inquiry altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.788" offset="986627">Now--</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="204.335" offset="988821">So in that case... and then let's say you're at trial, and you ask: Did you fire this person because she punched in late a few times?</text>
            <text syncTime="211.287" offset="1016615">I take it that the objection would be that that's irrelevant, and that would be sustained.</text>

            <text syncTime="259.805" offset="1210653">Now that seems to me to be the problem, that either... going back to Justice Scalia's point, you're either going to say rational in these circumstances, which means you go into it whether the time sheet was this or whether it was that or the other; or you say, hey, it's always rational because he could have fired him because he doesn't like the person.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.486" offset="1289438">That's... and I don't see some intermediate step there.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.748" offset="1306470">To put the question differently, every government has a, State and Federal, has an administrative procedures act.</text>

            <text syncTime="351.597" offset="1577830">That is that for Bivens the question is, will the court imply a right of action, as opposed to the issue in this case, which is Section 1983.</text>

            <text syncTime="380.429" offset="1693187">It doesn't... the existence of those State remedies does not displace by itself without a statutory... without Congress coming in and mandating exhaustion or something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.785" offset="1738640">But in the absence of that, this Court has not said, outside of the limited area of procedural due process, that the existence of either collective-bargaining agreements or State laws somehow displaces a Federal constitutional guarantee.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.186" offset="1792243">Now, if I could return to the first part of Justice Breyer's question, which was the dividing line in whether there is a clear standard, let me articulate this as one.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.043" offset="1827665">We believe that when a government employer comes in and asserts some sort of objective reality, you know, so for here they said the wheat prices are declining, the plaintiff should have a chance to negate that and say, well, it turned out that actually the wheat prices weren't declining, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.784" offset="1902584">If, however, the plaintiff... the government articulates the rationale that you had put forth before, I don't like you, and somehow the supervisor says it's interfering with my government efficiency and I can't do the job, well, that's something that the employer will never really be able to... the employee will never be able to negate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1568.442" offset="6445174">It's also consistent with this Court's recognition, again in other constitutional contexts, that the rights of public employees simply are not as expansive in a number of ways as those of citizens generally vis-a-vis their public employers.</text>

            <text syncTime="3392.270" offset="13740547">I mean, we would allow under our theory any claim that is not just a residual ill will or bad motive states a valid equal protection case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3436.732" offset="13918389">That of course as a practical matter is not the way at-will works anymore, because of the panoply of rules, Title 7 and otherwise that force employers to articulate rationales when they terminate at-will employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="3519.433" offset="14249203">So in this case the government put forth one rationale which was an objective one, we... and disclaimed all the others, the subjective ones; and we do think that that subjective rationales in employment is different, and would almost always be a rational basis.</text>
