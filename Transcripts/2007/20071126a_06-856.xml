            <text syncTime="980.489" offset="4091336">And that really goes to the core of the difference between an (a)(2) claim and an (a)(3) claim on one hand, and an (a)(1) claim on the other hand.</text>

            <text syncTime="1094.912" offset="4549001">It is clear that the core losses are diminution in trust assets or failure of trust assets to appreciate.</text>
