            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="171608">We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 06-1287, CSX Transportation v. the Georgia State Board of Equalization.</text>

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="10.369" offset="212986">: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress in what is now Section 11501(b)(1) crafted what this Court described as a straightforward approach to determining whether a State is unlawfully taxing railroad property.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.520" offset="269619">Congress used a precise formula that is set out in a pictorial form on page 6 of the Petitioner's brief, and I think it's probably easier to kind of follow along on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.639" offset="310161">What basically Congress said is that the court in making a determination as to whether there's an illegal tax considers the assessed value of rail transportation property as the numerator on the left side of the fraction, compares that to the true market value of rail transportation property, and then compares that ratio to the ratio created by examining the assessed value of other commercial and industrial property over the true market value.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.896" offset="415174">Fortunately, in this particular case three out of four of those variables are agreed to by the parties, so the only issue in this case is what constitutes the true market value of the rail transportation property within the meaning of that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.000" offset="467523">This Court in Burlington Northern first evaluated the language of this statute and held, in what I think the Court later would describe as a straightforward fashion, that 10501(b)(1) declares that the district court... for the district court, that it is necessary for that court to determine what the true market values of the respective properties are.</text>

            <text syncTime="96.319" offset="556862">Is it realistic to think that you can calculate with any degree of precision what the true market value of CSX's property is?</text>
            <text syncTime="105.875" offset="595105">The range of values that were calculated by both of these experts are really astonishing, from 12.3 billion to 8.1 billion for Dickerson, from 9.3 to 5.9 for Tegarden.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.134" offset="656127">It's like $3 billion or $4 billion doesn't mean anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.681" offset="666263">What is the... can this be done with any precision or is it more realistic just to say that what the district court would have to do is to figure out whether the State's calculation is within some reasonable range?</text>

            <text syncTime="135.851" offset="714955">No, I think it's pretty clear that Congress did not adopt that particular formulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.114" offset="731987">What Congress tasked the district court with doing was determining the true market value.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.065" offset="751840">And if you look at footnote 8 of the district court's opinion, I think he does a fairly interesting job of explaining what that would normally mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.546" offset="777753">He says: In an ordinary valuation case I would take in all of the expert testimony from the railroad, I would take in all of the expert testimony of the State, I would evaluate them and I would come up with a conclusion as to what I think is the true market value.</text>

            <text syncTime="189.465" offset="929368">So if the, so if the district court says this methodology, Methodology A, most accurately yields true market value, that is giving rise to a Federal rule of determining value, isn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="202.618" offset="982031">I think all it says is that in this particular case under these particular circumstances that methodology led to what was the true market value.</text>

            <text syncTime="212.959" offset="1023409">If he says I think, you know, whatever it is, discounted value approach is the best way for determining market value, he's not going to in the next case or the district court isn't going to be able to say, I think reproduction cost is the best method.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.560" offset="1089760">You're going to establish a Federal rule for what is the best way of determining market value.</text>

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="234.403" offset="1109195">Mr. Chief Justice, I think that's not accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.321" offset="1116823">I think what will happen is that the circumstances change every day.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.321" offset="1128839">Let's just take a pretty simple example.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.727" offset="1138452">Let's assume that in year 1 the district court decides to use discounted cash flow.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.507" offset="1157574">In year 2 it turns out that CSX or some other railroad property is sold, so that you have an actual direct sales comparison data available to you by which to make the market value.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="257.125" offset="1200101">That happens, that happens once every 25 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.845" offset="1206893">If you prevail on a method that you think is more favorable to railroads before a particular district court, you're going to cite that district court in the next case that you've got and you say: Look a district court's already looked at this and they said Method A is a better way of determining market value.</text>

          <turn speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="274.073" stopTime="285.740">

            <text syncTime="274.557" offset="1269796">I'm sure that's true that we'll cite it, but the reality is that the district court in the second case is not bound by the decision of the district court in the first case.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.178" offset="1304277">And the truth is every single one of these--</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="285.740" offset="1314517">So if a district court says in one case Method A is the best way to get market value and another district court says Method B and they both appeal, the court of appeals is going to have to resolve that conflict, isn't it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="295.438" offset="1353283">--Well, at the end of the day the district court's going to make a valuation.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.999" offset="1367598">It's going to say that this is the true market value.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.826" offset="1378883">That determination is a question of fact and therefore, yes, the court of appeals will evaluate that to determine whether or not that fact is clearly erroneous.</text>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="309.492" offset="1409499">I think you said that CSX has properties in 15 States that use the unit method of calculation.</text>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="316.241" offset="1436561">So if you challenge all of those there could be 15 different district court findings on true market value, and so within each circuit the court of appeals would have to decide which district court was correct as a matter of fact?</text>

            <text syncTime="328.503" offset="1485567">Sure, Justice Alito, that's exactly what could happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.127" offset="1496016">But the reality is is that that's exactly what's been going on since the statute was enacted in 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.405" offset="1521198">48 of the 50 States have railroads that have to be evaluated and, as the AAR's amicus brief points out, there have been 12 cases on this particular issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.635" offset="1566129">It is not as though it is cost-free for the railroads to challenge what the States are doing under these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.537" offset="1593714">There is no cost shifting or fee shifting arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.723" offset="1606462">And second, you're suing the very person who's going to be making the decision next year as to the value of your property.</text>

            <text syncTime="364.924" offset="1631226">Well, but it's already been pointed out if the range is a variable of $4 billion I think it probably is worth their while to challenge what they think is a low valuation.</text>

            <text syncTime="376.030" offset="1675634">Well, blissfully, more often than not it turns out that the overvaluation are not nearly that stark.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.419" offset="1697264">But I think that goes to the core point here, which is that if this Court concludes like the Eleventh Circuit did, which is that there is no basis for challenging the methodology, then it would have been completely within the province of the State of Georgia to say, we're going to adopt a stock and debt method, which virtually everybody recognizes is not an accurate way to determine true market value, that that number would have been $12.2 billion.</text>

            <text syncTime="405.830" offset="1794857">What if we were to adopt a different approach which said that you can challenge the methodology, methodology, when different methodologies are used, but if the State is using the same methodology that's their choice?</text>
            <text syncTime="419.482" offset="1849505">It seems to me the only other alternative is to have the Federal judiciary develop a Federal rule about what methodology has to be used.</text>

            <text syncTime="432.912" offset="1903213">I think what Congress intended is what happens in every run of the mine valuation case that comes up in either State or Federal court, which is that each side presents its best guess as to what the true market value is and the district court resolves those differences and comes out with a number that the district court believes constitutes the true market value.</text>

            <text syncTime="1037.140" offset="4320166">Rather, it established a Federal right against State discrimination in which the railroad could bring a de novo suit in Federal court to vindicate that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.636" offset="4366142">Justice Alito pointed out the wide range of value that could be generated by generally accepted methodologies... 6 billion to 12.4 billion, in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.849" offset="4422984">Clearly, if one were to accept the State's rule that any reasonable methodology, by which they mean any methodology that is reasonable in the abstract that may have been approved by this Court in the 1800's, a State could hide any variety of discriminations within that rubric.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.434" offset="4517339">There would be very little, if any meat to Federal court review under the 4-R Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1235.247" offset="5112512">And the court's role, in our view, is to consider all of the evidences of value, not just the State's evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1559.599" offset="6409962">There is no question that the statute refers to the burden of proof in determining true market value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.375" offset="6441100">In Burlington Northern, the Court recognized that the allocation of burden of proof demonstrates that it is a fact to be proved to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.529" offset="6473701">In fact, in se, with respect to true market value of the commercial and industrial properties, it specifically says that it is to be proved to the satisfaction of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.198" offset="6516333">Now in Burlington Northern, the Court remarked that it would be unreasonable to construe the statute to lead to strikingly different approaches, whether the railroad's challenge was based on the alleged undervaluation of other properties or overvaluation of the railroad property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.473" offset="6585401">Now, we know from the statute that the court is not to defer to any methodology, or amalgam of methodologies, the State uses in valuing other commercial and industrial property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.718" offset="6634406">Rather, the court is to look to the best evidence of value, which is sales data.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.029" offset="6655722">Now, if the court has sales data available to it in the case regarding the value of the railroad, certainly the court should rely on that reliable information, rather than the State's chosen methodology.</text>

            <text syncTime="3237.365" offset="13121028">Well, Your Honor, I think our... our response is that we believe that in 2002 what the State did was not only to make some changes in its valuation methodologies, but it also made a fairly significant change in the income numbers that the State was using to apply its discounted cash flow analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.062" offset="13187797">And specifically what it did: It started using... instead of numbers from the regulatory report, the R-1 report that the railroads filed with the Surface Transportation Board, it began to use income numbers from the annual reports to shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.167" offset="13244222">There is a significant difference in those numbers, and the testimony in this case was that the 47 percent increase that CSX saw in its assessment from 2001 to 2002 was attributable to the difference in the income numbers that were being used.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.018" offset="13315588">I suspect that for many of the other States that have low numbers for CSX, that they still use numbers from the regulatory reports as opposed to the annual reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.138" offset="13364072">So that's one reason that I believe we've got... we had such a larger number for 2002 than many other States, because our appraiser was looking to the correct income numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.242" offset="13412555">If I could, just in the remaining time that I've got, I'd like to mention a couple of points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.679" offset="13434289">The CSX has contended that this line between method and application is simply unworkable; and, therefore, the Court shouldn't recognize any... any such distinction under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.811" offset="13490818">We think there are a couple points where the lines are clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.841" offset="13502939">One is between the unit rule and the summation approaches.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.574" offset="13513806">The brief filed by the Association of American Railroads acknowledges that those are two different methods.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.635" offset="13542122">It's not... one could not say that a stock and debt method is just an application of discounted cash flow, so there are certain places where those lines are clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.928" offset="13579216">We believe the fact that the line may not always be... or the boundaries may not always be perfectly distinct, or that the test may not always be what it might be easy to describe in the abstract... it doesn't mean that the distinction should not be recognized at all under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.672" offset="13638253">Also, there is the way in which the Eleventh Circuit formulated the test where the Eleventh Circuit said a line bar between method and application was between nonfactual determinations used in constructing the valuation process, however broad or narrow they might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.571" offset="13709828">The Court said that constitutes the method.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.478" offset="13717456">Everything else is an application.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.178" offset="13724248">The suggestion has been made by the Solicitor General in their brief that... that that means as long as the State can announce or can set out its valuation rule in general enough terms, make it general enough, then that will become part of the method and not part of the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.576" offset="13797809">I think if the Eleventh Circuit's opinion is read in context, the Eleventh circuit didn't say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.386" offset="13821110">Specifically, the Eleventh circuit was distinct... was saying... was rejecting the argument in that case that only the distinction between the unit rule and the summation approach is... was the only methodological distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.461" offset="13873355">And the Court was saying: We think that differences in methodologies include the stock and debt, the discounted cash flow, and the market multiples approaches used in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.131" offset="13908046">So the Eleventh Circuit did go and consider the argument that the State had... should not have used a 6.3 percent terminal growth rate in the discounted cash flow analysis even though that it used that in... in all... for all public utilities.</text>

            <text syncTime="3457.480" offset="14001459">First of all, Justice Stevens, in response to your question on the comparisons between Georgia and other States, on page 22 of our cert petition we pointed out that in the 2006 tax year Georgia and Florida had adopted unit values of $11.2 billion and $12.9 billion; whereas, every other State in those jurisdictions that used the unit value had an assessment value of $7.1 billion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.592" offset="14093933">And the Respondent State did not question that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.622" offset="14106054">So I mean the reality is there are wide swings, and it does make a difference what methodology you do, and it's part of the reason why it's absolutely critical that the Court should enforce the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.323" offset="14148895">As Justice Scalia quite properly recognizes, it is the true market value.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.260" offset="14168643">And this is not a statute like, for instance, 28 U.S.C. 1254(d)(1) in AEDPA, which says the Federal courts should defer to any reasonable determination by the State courts in a judgment Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.409" offset="14221201">This is a statute that vests the district court with the exclusive authority to make the determination of the true market value.</text>

            <text syncTime="3531.887" offset="14299151">Absolutely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.573" offset="14301868">And that's... and that's exactly the point, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.651" offset="14310122">There isn't any single method that's out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.726" offset="14318481">All we have are a series of evidences of value, and the district court needs to be able to evaluate them without regard to some kind of thumb on the scale of the State, in favor of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.317" offset="14360800">And as you asked the question, you know, is there any other valuation process that would work this way, the answer was no.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.346" offset="14384937">And the problem is that there is nothing in this, in this statute that remotely suggests that Congress would have wanted to do anything other than the ordinary or typical valuation in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.358" offset="14429032">Justice Souter, I think you made the point, which is the one I wanted to make in my opening statement, which is how is it possible that Congress recognizes decades of discrimination involving tens or hundreds of millions of dollars would have said and now when you get to the point of trying to correct that discrimination, what are you going to do?</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.521" offset="14497681">Defer to the entity that's been discriminating for all of those years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.739" offset="14514504">It is at least passing strange, if not incredible to think that that's what Congress meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.112" offset="14536029">It is much more sensible to think that Congress wanted the district court to serve as a serious check on what the state did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.046" offset="14563719">That's what we didn't get in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.186" offset="14572287">That's what we are entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.388" offset="14577094">I urge the Court to vacate and to revamp.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.544" offset="14585766">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
