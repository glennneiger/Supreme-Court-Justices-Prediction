            <text syncTime="7.638" offset="200418">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When Judge Robert W. Pratt of the Southern District of Iowa sentenced Brian Michael Gall on May 27, 2005, he found Mr. Gall to be an individual who had fully rehabilitated himself by having voluntarily withdrawn from a conspiracy five years earlier, by remaining crime-free throughout that period, by having rid himself of his addictions, by having graduated from college, by having learned a trade, by having built a successful and thriving business.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.123" offset="354331">Judge Pratt carefully weighed the Section 3553(a) factors and in a ten-page sentencing memorandum set forth cogent reasons why a sentence of probation would better fit the purposes and factors specified in Section 3553(a) than a sentence of incarceration.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.190" offset="454642">The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that judgment on the basis of the extraordinary circumstances test that we would ask the Court to overturn today.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.186" offset="498632">The Eighth Circuit substituted its judgment for that of Judge Pratt, saying that Judge Pratt had placed too much weight on Mr. Gall's voluntary withdrawal from the conspiracy and in so doing had not satisfied or overcome the extraordinariness barrier.</text>

            <text syncTime="187.737" offset="920771">In other words, if all of the circumstances and facts point a certain way... in this instance, for example, they point to a downward departure... and suddenly the judge goes up to the statutory max, that might be an instance in which a court of appeals could say no reasonable judge would have imposed that sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="226.924" offset="1077505">He could have stopped the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.454" offset="1083670">And, similarly, yes, he rehabilitated himself, but he earned some 30 to $40,000 in the drug business, and that aided his rehabilitation, and maybe there's some kind of obligation to pay back.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.370" offset="1151380">So could a court of appeals try to instruct district judges and say: Now, in this factor, leaving a conspiracy, we want district judges to be aware of the difference between one who leaves and blows the whistle and one who lets it continue; and, similarly, one who uses the ill-gotten gains to set himself up in business.</text>

            <text syncTime="3268.337" offset="13243252">But the court of appeals have not attempted to create a mathematical grid, because such an exercise would be both contrary to the notion of advisory guidelines, and also one that is inherently arbitrary.</text>

            <text syncTime="3556.736" offset="14396820">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.688" offset="14408627">Most bluntly, an I-know-it-when-I-see-it test or a holistic test is not likely to generate much in the way of warranted uniformity either.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.340" offset="14459200">Justice Scalia, you pointed out, in your question about whether this sentence was excessive or not on the basis of the... of the facts, that the government is blowing smoke with respect to its statement that the guidelines is purely advisory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.178" offset="14526596">Well, it's not only doing that; it's removing the exercise of discretion by the district judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.627" offset="14552405">It's saying to the district judge, you must demonstrate to us facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.500" offset="14571840">You must come to us with facts that not only consist of explanations of reasons but are sufficiently persuasive or compelling to overcome our natural resistance to an outside-the-guidelines sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.635" offset="14636415">That I submit is, as articulated earlier, making the guidelines presumptive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.789" offset="14656999">And it imposes a fact-finding requirement that is in violation of the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.240" offset="14678838">Justice Ginsburg, you asked about whether the prosecutor had, in fact, heard all of the evidence with respect to... or stated all the evidence to the district court with respect to Mr. Gall.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.203" offset="14730665">The answer to that question is he most certainly did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.358" offset="14739337">And I agree with my colleague that this case is the mirror of Rita.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.794" offset="14753025">In Rita, the district judge was presented with a wealth of facts about Mr. Rita's prior good works, his military service, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="3654.228" offset="14786776">Here, the district judge was again presented with a wealth of facts with respect to Mr. Gall's voluntary rehabilitation, with respect to his having grown, developed, and established a business and rid himself of crime and drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3669.114" offset="14846335">And this district judge exercised his discretion to go down on the basis of those facts and imposed a sentence of probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.922" offset="14877577">And, Justice Stevens, the Eighth Circuit, even before the Guidelines, even before the Booker case, in 1993, in 1999, in cases called One Star and Decora respectively, went down from even higher levels to probation based upon the particular facts of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3696.009" offset="14953855">We would ask the Court to overturn the judgment of the Eighth Circuit and abandon the extraordinary circumstances test.</text>
