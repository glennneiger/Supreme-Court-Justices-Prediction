            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104840">In -- in the realm of the federal securities laws, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the SEC's rule that enforces that statute, Rule 10b-5, prohibit deceptive statements in connection with the purchase and sale of securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.094" offset="177147">Under these provisions, the SEC can bring enforcement actions against violators, and this Court has also held that the statute and the rule contained implied authorization for a private cause of action enforceable in the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.719" offset="231691">Investors -- investors who are injured by reason of a securities violation can bring an action to recover damages in certain instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.335" offset="262097">And this case involves the reach of that so-called “implied private cause of action”.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.104" offset="281219">It's a class action suit, where the suit comes to us in a posture where we assume the plaintiffs investor's allegation is to be true, though these facts have not yet been established after an evidentiary trial or -- or a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.706" offset="343599">The company whose shares are involved is called Charter Communications Inc., and it's a cable television operator.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.109" offset="369199">As part of its service, it provides it's customers with boxes to convert digital cable signals and the boxes go on top of the television set, and in the trade they're called “set-top boxes”.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.008" offset="424788">The suit alleges that late in the year 2000, Charter's executives realized that the company would fall short of projected operating cash flow.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.300" offset="465957">And so they decided to engage in some deceptive accounting practices to make Charter's cash flow look better.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.229" offset="493751">And it's alleged that as part of their plan, Charter made deceptive contracts with two of its suppliers.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.614" offset="515276">Those suppliers are Scientific-Atlanta and Motorola, and they're the respondents here and those two respondents supplied Charter with the set-top boxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.691" offset="555504">It's alleged that Charter arranged to overpay respondents $20 for each box that Charter purchased until the end of the year with the understanding that he respondents would return the overpayment by purchasing advertising from Charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.951" offset="608585">The respondents agreed to the arrangement and so it's alleged, that Charter's auditors would not discover the link between the overpayments for the boxes and the advertising purchases.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.471" offset="650695">Respondent's drafted documents to make the transactions appear to be unrelated and conducted it in the ordinary course of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.282" offset="677967">Charter then, in violation of generally accepted accounting principles, recorded the advertising payments on its financial statements inflating revenue by approximately $17 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.842" offset="716105">Respondents had no role in preparing or disseminating the financial statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.083" offset="737108">The -- the petitioner is the lead plaintiff in the class action, representing the Charter investors and the petitioner filed suit against these respondent companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.405" offset="786427">It contends that liability is appropriate because the respondents engaged in conduct with the purpose in effect of creating a false appearance of material fact to a further scheme to -- to misrepresent Charter's revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.560" offset="835015">Petitioner says that financial statement Charter released to the public was a natural and expected consequence of the respondent's deceptive acts and that respondent's -- and that had the respondents not assisted Charter, Charter's auditor would not have been fooled and with that special contracts the financial statements would have been a more accurate reflect -- reflection of the company financial condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.272" offset="921846">We reject these arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.357" offset="930205">Were the petitioner's theory to be adopted, the implied cause of action would reach the whole marketplace in which the issuing company does business and there's no authority for this rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.545" offset="963015">Although conduct can be deceptive for the purpose of Section 10(b), the dispositive issue in this case is reliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.082" offset="985167">We conclude respondent's deceptive acts which were not disclosed to the investing public, are too remote to satisfy the requirement of reliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.132" offset="1013274">It was Charter and not the respondents that misled its auditor and filed fraudulent financial statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.314" offset="1038038">And nothing the respondents did made it necessary or -- or inevitable for Charter to record the transactions in the way it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.999" offset="1064788">With the implied cause of action to be extended to the practices described here, there would be a risk that the federal power would be used to invite litigations beyond the immediate seer of securities litigation and in areas already covered by functioning and effective state law guarantees.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.518" offset="1122884">Our precedence counsel against this extension, Section 10(b), does not incorporate common law fraud in the federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.331" offset="1150156">This conclusion is consistent with the narrow dimensions we must give to a right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.071" offset="1165098">Congress did not authorize when it first enacted the statute and did not expand when it revisited the law recently in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.080" offset="1205118">We affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.847" offset="1228210">Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion which Justice Souter and Justice Ginsburg have joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.719" offset="1247645">Justice Breyer took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</text>
