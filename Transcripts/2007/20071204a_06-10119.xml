            <label>Mr. Stephen B. Bright</label>
            <text syncTime="8.560" offset="205025">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The decision here of the majority of the Louisiana Supreme Court on remand from this Court is an extraordinary departure from the lessons that this Court taught in its Miller-El decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.602" offset="265211">And I point out sort of three overarching errors in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.101" offset="279213">First, the majority looked at each of the Miller-El factors or some of them, and largely discounted them.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.175" offset="311500">That there were five African-Americans struck, they whittled that down to two.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.642" offset="325397">That there was disparate questioning, they identified that of the white jurors and Jeffrey Brooks, but they said that counted for the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.967" offset="358625">And Miller-El clearly teaches that it didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.717" offset="365626">They found there was no racial implication in the mention of O.J. Simpson case from the start of the case all the way through, because neither O.J. Simpson's race nor Mr. Snyder's race was mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.742" offset="417766">Secondly, there were some Miller-El factors that were not considered at all, not even acknowledged.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.021" offset="446919">For example, one of the most powerful ones, the failure to ask any questions of Jeffrey Brooks or Elaine Scott.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.064" offset="475027">There are very ambiguous general reasons for striking them.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.922" offset="486521">They asked no questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.063" offset="491014">In this case, you could ask anybody any questions you wanted as a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.420" offset="512434">And then thirdly, when they got to the point of considering them cumulatively, they had now whittled them down to where there was very little to consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.885" offset="550364">And our position is that what Justice Kimball did, the author of the original decision, who wrote the dissenting opinion, one of the two dissents here, actually did what this Court remanded this case to do, which was reconsideration in light of Miller-El, because when you consider all those factors together, nothing answers the question of or explains them as well as race.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.032" offset="642942">You can pick each piece out, each leaf out and you can try to find an innocent explanation for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.843" offset="666139">But when you stand back and look at it all together... and that's why the court missed the fact that the back strike was racially motivated in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.152" offset="703441">It just simply didn't look at these things in the context--</text>

            <text syncTime="140.447" offset="732594">What is the relevance of strikes of black lawyers that you don't argue were based on race?</text>
            <text syncTime="149.520" offset="768852">It's hard for me to understand why that's relevant in this calculation.</text>

            <text syncTime="160.531" offset="812947">Let's say the prosecution has the strategy of striking every lawyer who's on the panel.</text>

            <text syncTime="181.227" offset="895703">Well, if that's the case and you have considered that in Miller-El, that's a factor for race neutrality.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.757" offset="917855">The difference here is the reason given for striking Brooks, for example, is he might have a reason to go home--</text>

            <text syncTime="3330.393" offset="13492366">If I could just say, first of all about, this backstrike, because what we see here is after Elaine Scott is struck, that's State number 6, the very next peremptory strike by the State it, number 7, is to go back and backstrike Jeffrey Brooks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.839" offset="13558194">Now, notice that with regard to the other four backstrikes used, two by the prosecution and two by the defense, it's at the very end of the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.631" offset="13589332">It's literally when they're down to one juror.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.225" offset="13599677">Williams says, 11 jurors&gt; ["]?</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.725" offset="13609708">And then he backstrikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.801" offset="13613992">The defense says, 11th strike&gt; ["]?</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.097" offset="13627157">Backstrike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.081" offset="13631128">Williams then, 11&gt; ["]?</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.002" offset="13642831">So these... the only way the backstrike makes sense really, when you think about it, is to look at the whole jury and then go back and cull out the ones based on a comparison.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.372" offset="13684313">But once Brooks had kept them from striking Mr. Scott, who as Mr. Boudreaux pointed out, his wife was robbed at gunpoint, said he would testify if he were a defendant in a case and was innocent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.788" offset="13749933">And then as Justice Stevens pointed out, Hawkins, who was... had grown children, engineer, friends in the police department... these two are not struck... but then once Elaine Scott is struck, the third back and the Batson challenge is made, we don't have any use for Jeffrey Brooks anymore, so he's... the backstrike is used in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.155" offset="13831435">And I think, again, when you look at all the relevant circumstances, it's pretty clear what was going on here with the acceptance of Brooks at the start and the backstrike--</text>

            <text syncTime="3423.448" offset="13864558">Do you agree with your friend on the other side, that you could have objected both to the backstruck juror and to the jurors to whom you... with respect to whom you did not object because there was... the juror that was later backstruck on the jury?</text>

            <text syncTime="3441.222" offset="13935716">The answer to that is yes, and I think, if the defense had, we'd be talking about four jurors here today instead of two.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.579" offset="13957136">But it doesn't diminish from what the Court in Miller-El called the numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.748" offset="13981796">The fact that it is unlikely to be, by chance, that all five... all five African-Americans are struck in this case.</text>

Simpson argument... not only depending upon the race of the defendant, but if there had been black people on that jury.</text>
