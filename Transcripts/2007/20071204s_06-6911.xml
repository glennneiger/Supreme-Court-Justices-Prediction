            <text syncTime="9.475" offset="142465">We decide in this case the meaning of the words “civil rights restored” contained in a provision on sentencing under the Armed Career Criminal Act or ACCA.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.272" offset="201711">Ordinarily, felons who possess firearms are subject to a maximum sentence of 10 years, but ACCA increases the maximum to life and the minimum to 15 years for felons who have three prior convictions for violent felonies.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.392" offset="278198">Congress defined violent felonies to include violent misdemeanors punishable under state law by more than two years in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.993" offset="316545">Pivotal here, Congress exempted from classification as violent felonies, cases in which the offender has had his civil rights restored.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.443" offset="366387">Petitioner James Logan pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.615" offset="387076">He was sentenced to ACCA's mandatory minimum of 15 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.810" offset="403794">His ACCA enhanced sentence rested on three prior convictions in Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.153" offset="429185">Each was for misdemeanor battery, a crime punishable by more than two years imprisonment but causing no loss of civil rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.336" offset="469936">Challenging his enhanced sentence, Logan argued that convictions carrying no loss of civil rights are functionally equivalent to convictions for which rights are loss but later regained. The District Court upheld the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.294" offset="533780">One cannot have civil rights restored, the Court said, unless they were earlier withdrawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.739" offset="563559">The Seventh Circuit affirmed as we do in turn.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.367" offset="578083">Congress, we hold, did not include offenders who retained civil rights at all times, in its dispensation for offenders whose civil rights have been restored.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.650" offset="627193">The ordinary meaning of the word “restored” is to give back something that has been taken away.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.946" offset="652376">Indicating that Congress intended restore to have its ordinary meaning, the words “civil rights restored” appear in the statute's text together with other acts of official forgiveness, expungements, set asides and pardons.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.417" offset="714233">The offender who retains rights all along however gets post conviction no official token of forgiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.368" offset="746103">Literal interpretation, Logan objects ought not to control when it yields absurd results.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.871" offset="772121">In some States, Logan points out, misdemeanants retain civil rights while felons lose, but then automatically regain rights on release from prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.610" offset="826978">What sense does it makes he asked to expose lesser offenders, misdemeanants to heighten punishment while more serious offenders who got back civil rights automatically may escape ACCA's reach?</text>
            <text syncTime="194.953" offset="884447">The anomaly is less glaring then Logan suggest, An offender whose civil rights have been restored will gain no exemption from ACCA if the State explicitly prohibits him from possessing firearms, a ban many States impose.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.691" offset="951321">Such a felon has no advantage over a misdemeanant who never lost his civil rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.595" offset="974936">Logan's reading also creates anomalies.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.676" offset="987265">Well, we too accept his interpretation that in a State that does not revoke any offender’s civil rights, even a murder conviction could gain exemption from ACCA.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.811" offset="1035853">Although Congress explicitly placed state misdemeanors within ACCA's ambit, Logan's interpretation, we emphasize would effectively place them beyond ACCA's reach for misdemeanants generally retain their civil rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.261" offset="1105652">We are disinclined to say that what Congress imposed with one hand, it withdrew with the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.763" offset="1127595">Moreover, even if we were convinced that Logan was exposed to ACCA because of a congressional oversight or mistake, we have no means or authority or determine which of several solutions Congress might adopt.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.971" offset="1184438">The distinction between rights retained and rights restored, we note finally, may not have been inadvertent.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.602" offset="1214949">In a provision modelled almost word for word on ACCA but relating to domestic violence, Congress explicitly excluded from civil rights restored, convictions for which civil right were never taken away.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.603" offset="1270955">Given the resemblance between the two statutes, it is surely reasonable to conclude that Congress intended civil rights restored to convey the same meaning in both provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.613" offset="1315050">In prescribing sentences under ACCA, Congress chose to incorporate state law classifications and definitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.042" offset="1344725">The diversity of those laws made sentencing disparities inevitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.224" offset="1365518">Recognizing that reality, we hold that the word “civil rights restored” in the provision under inspection mean just that and do not encompass civil rights retained.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.092" offset="1412957">Our decision is unanimous.</text>
