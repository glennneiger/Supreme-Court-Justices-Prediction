            <text syncTime="16.056" offset="226891">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In adopting Initiative 872, Washington's voters followed this Court's guidance in California Democratic Party v. Jones.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.491" offset="268687">They adopted a top-two election system.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.240" offset="279658">By so doing the voters eliminated the crucial constitutional defect of a partisan blanket primary because in the top-two system the voters are no longer selecting the party's nominees for the November election.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.406" offset="328350">The Ninth Circuit nonetheless ruled that Initiative 872 is unconstitutional, holding that allowing each candidate to state his or her personal party preference on the ballot would create the appearance of association between a political party and candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.792" offset="389895">The Ninth Circuit is wrong for at least two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.946" offset="398463">First, the Ninth Circuit's appearance... of-association conclusion assumes that top-two ballots will look the same as ballots under a party nominating election system.</text>

            <text syncTime="88.294" offset="515910">However, Your Honor, we may look to the declaration of candidacy form, which the secretary of state did have the opportunity to promulgate, which appears in the corrected joint appendix at pages 592-593.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.164" offset="567318">And what we see there, Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, is that, unlike the old declaration of candidacy form, we have the candidates declaring themselves as a candidate for the office of blank, and instead of saying that they're a candidate of a party, they say... that you have an opportunity to check off the box that my party preference is blank or I'm... I am an independent candidate; or, under Initiative 872, if they check neither box, that will be left blank on the ballot.</text>

            <text syncTime="165.497" offset="824677">In fact, in the State's earliest days candidates were given five words they could use for whatever expression they wished.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.682" offset="849441">But the voters chose to allow an expression of party preference, which the State is allowed to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="2917.967" offset="11834558">In the scenario or the ballot on page 1, Justice Stevens, I believe that what would happen is the Secretary of State would still provide the additional language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.681" offset="11869457">If that additional language is not provided, if it were just that bare ballot with no explanatory language, then, yes, it would be much harder to defend as being constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.412" offset="11900282">But that, in fact, is not the way it's going to work.</text>

            <text syncTime="2936.771" offset="11909790">But my point is there could never be a ballot just like this, what your opponents are talking about, because there are always going to be at least two or three R's and two or three D's.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.220" offset="11951586">And the sample shows there is only one, which must then be the party chosen... I mean the nominee chosen at the convention.</text>

            <text syncTime="2955.014" offset="11982724">But the key here, Your Honor, is that even under the ballot on page one, what is not happening under top-two is that the nominee of the party is not being selected.</text>

            <text syncTime="2966.383" offset="12028177">And in Jones the Court said that the top-two is the same in all characteristics save one, which is the result of the nominee not being selected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.739" offset="12073630">And that is exactly what is happening under top-two: The nominee is not being selected; and, as applied, we are going to be providing lots of other information on the ballot to make it very clear what the expression "party preference" means.</text>
