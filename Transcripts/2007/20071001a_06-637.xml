            <text syncTime="10.540" offset="211982">Mr. Koerner.</text>

          <turn speaker="leonard_j_koerner" startTime="11.492" stopTime="231.344">
            <label>Mr. Leonard J. Koerner</label>
            <text syncTime="11.492" offset="215744">Mr. Chief Justice, and members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.246" offset="222849">In 1985 when this Court decided the Burlington decision, it based... it based it based on the broad remedial clause set forth in 20 U.S.C. 1415, which allowed an impartial hearing officer, a state review officer, or the court, itself, to grant relief where appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.956" offset="293693">In so doing, it noted that there was no other substantive section which touched and concerned the issue before the Court, and that is whether an individual can voluntarily remove a child and seek tuition reimbursement before the conclusion of the administrative and court remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.685" offset="356596">It made a point of noting that it felt it was gleaning the congressional intent; and, had Congress known that the administrative and court process would be protracted, it would have provided a process which would allow the child to be removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.193" offset="418559">Similarly, in the sequel, the Carter case, the Court made the other... the same conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.957" offset="441651">It noted that, although the primary responsibilities to educate the child in a public school, least restrictive environment, there would be occasions when you would place that child outside, having been in the school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.843" offset="489194">1412, which was the eligibility section during this period, was very truncated.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.747" offset="512809">It did not provide a lot of conversation concerning the relationship of public and private schools within the IDEA.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.682" offset="544573">It provided that you had to provide the child who demanded it a FAPE, a free appropriate education.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.740" offset="572786">If you couldn't do that, the public school had to then pay for the tuition.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.599" offset="588250">It was silent though on the relationship between the private schools where the child voluntary removes.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.050" offset="609984">In 1997 the IDEA was codified, and for the first time the specific section was inserted dealing with the relationship of children and private schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.044" offset="658049">Indeed, 20 U.S.C. 1412(a)(10)... just the beginning, just that paragraph, says "children placed in private schools" and the structure was detailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.244" offset="702771">Subdivision (A) dealt with the relationshiop of the private schools with the public system generally and noted that, in that particular case, while the children would be entitled to some small amount of Federal funding, they would not be entitled in private school to a free appropriate public education.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.969" offset="777690">We also noted that if a parent was dissatisfied with the service plan, they'd have to seek relief administratively.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.921" offset="805484">They would not be entitled to an impartial due process or a court review.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.122" offset="822307">It was a recognition that children who are placed in private school were entitled to much lesser services than children placed in public school.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.415" offset="859506">Subdivision (B) dealt with the situation when children were not placed in public school but the local district consented that they could not provide a free appropriate public education.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.160" offset="910497">As a consequence, in those cases and in only those cases, since the public would then be supervising and directing the private school, they would be responsible for the tuition.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.734" offset="956786">Sub (C) is the issue now before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.279" offset="970892">Sub (C) is entitled Children Placed in Private School, Payment and Where the Local Education Aagency Did Not Consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.759" offset="1012897">And that particular section is broken down again into three parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.351" offset="1031182">The first part says, if a child is offered FAPE, that is, a child is given a program which is adequate, you cannot get reimbursement if you remove your child during any time but in this case during the pendency of the administrative and the court process.</text>

            <text syncTime="1504.490" offset="6187754">Now, there are two other arguments that I want to address.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.863" offset="6205308">One, recognizing that the language seems to support the petitioner's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.111" offset="6230281">They argue that, in fact, they did get special education and related services because for the years 1997 and 1998 and 1998-1999, we settled with them and we did pay the tuition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.871" offset="6285347">But Paragraph 17 of each of those agreements specifically provided that the settlement was not to create any admission for future applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.571" offset="6320142">And as this Court is aware, both under the Federal Rules of Evidence in its decisions in Arizona v. Colorado and the U.S. First International Building Company, if you settle, it has no probative value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.550" offset="6367999">All you do is settle the specific claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.236" offset="6378761">You don't settle the legal issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.908" offset="6385449">The second argument they make is, well, we have got an IEP.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.625" offset="6400286">An IEP is a proposal of how we would service the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.108" offset="6414288">And that IEP would constitute a special education and related service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.215" offset="6438634">But an IEP which the parent rejects could never be a special education related system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.010" offset="6461831">You have to be in the system receiving it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.461" offset="6471653">And indeed, in Section 1414 of U.S.C., it specifically provides if you reject the IEP, you've waived any right to a free and appropriate public education.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.911" offset="6513449">So once you do that, it ends the discussion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2943.784" offset="11944933">The way the 10-business-days requirement works in practice is that all of the IEPs... virtually all of them are proposed towards the end of the school year; and, typically, the parent is submitted the proposed IEP during the summer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.731" offset="12000730">And it's at that point that they have to make a decision whether to litigate that, put their child in a private school, or put them into a public school.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.854" offset="12029256">So the 10 business days in practice is not going to require the child to go into the inadequate placement.</text>

            <text syncTime="3027.313" offset="12279091">That subsection... it is on page 5a in the appendix to the Gray brief, lays down the general rule... the rule that tells school districts when they don't have to worry about paying reimbursement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.683" offset="12324544">And that is when they provide a free, a public... an appropriate public education in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.323" offset="12347114">That... that is consistent with Burlington and Carter, and that lays down the general rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.242" offset="12366758">School districts that provide an appropriate placement don't have to worry about reimbursement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.505" offset="12383790">Subsection (C)(ii) then goes on to identify a particular fact pattern which also happens to be the most common situation in which reimbursement claims are presented to the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.783" offset="12428929">And Congress in that situation, along with Subsections (3) and (4), provided the courts with more concrete guidance in determining how to exercise their discretion in that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.544" offset="12475950">The legislative history supports that interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.042" offset="12485981">On pages 25 to 29 of the National Disability Rights Network brief they explain how Congress in the legislative history indicates that they were focused on case law applying this Court's decision in Burlington and Carter where the students were already enrolled in public school.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.004" offset="12549824">There is no indication whatsoever at all in the legislative record that anybody had in mind scaling back the fundamental mandate of the statute for school districts to provide a free and appropriate public education for every child.</text>

            <text syncTime="3428.947" offset="13885622">Thank you, Mr. Garre.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.869" offset="13893249">Mr. Koerner, you have three minutes remaining.</text>

            <label>Mr. Leonard J. Koerner</label>
            <text syncTime="3434.211" offset="13906624">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.179" offset="13918536">First, this particular provision, as the Chief Justice noted, is called payment for private school placements where they don't have the consent of the local education.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.018" offset="13961899">Any reasonable reading of that is that it's all encompassing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.204" offset="13982588">And any person who has to apply has to satisfy those provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.576" offset="14000142">Second, this statute did not overrule Burlington or Carter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.855" offset="14017279">In those cases the children were already receiving special services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.244" offset="14042774">Now it could be in a future case someone would speak to extend those cases, but Congress has now spoken to make sure that Burlington and Carter go no further than you have previously held.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.520" offset="14087914">Third, there is an assumption that the program is going to be defective from day one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.175" offset="14106513">But that's contrary to this Court's decision in Schaffer which presumes the good faith of the individuals who propose in program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.703" offset="14136606">And that is the heart of the entire case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.735" offset="14144756">Fourth, let's assume, for example, that someone can create an ambiguity in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.997" offset="14165759">Citing the Arlington case, in which you placed yourself in the position of the local education officer, when you look at this particular section... and particularly C double... double i and triple i.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.945" offset="14221556">Would you, in that position, understand that it doesn't really mean what it says, that previously received special education services was only meant to cover the people already in the system and was not intended to cover people outside the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.798" offset="14277040">That isn't what it says.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.048" offset="14282056">More importantly, the ambiguity is clearly not obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.000" offset="14293863">So how would a local officer who has to understand whether or not to place the funds at risk know whether or not in complying with this particular situation, it was explicit or implicit?</text>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3542.807" offset="14341093">During the period between Burlington and the enactment of this statute, would you have any doubt about your potential obligation to reimburse a parent... during the period of Burlington and the enactment of the statute, would the school board have had doubt about its potential liability for reimbursement, in a situation like this?</text>

            <label>Mr. Leonard J. Koerner</label>
            <text syncTime="3561.861" offset="14417266">I think so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.814" offset="14421027">I think, because of Burlington and Carter, where the children were already in the system, this would be the next step.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.265" offset="14446836">Would we have presented to you the fact that you shouldn't expand it?</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.358" offset="14463241">Probably.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.764" offset="14468884">Would I know what you would conclude?</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.436" offset="14475571">No, but the statute eliminated that entire discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.916" offset="14489468">It is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.307" offset="14499081">But again, there is a very big spending clause... as I mentioned in my earlier presentation, if it's so ambiguous that you can read out a specific provision, how can that ambiguity not go down to the benefit of the city through it's local education system?</text>

            <text syncTime="3608.640" offset="14604407">It's not premised on any constitutional provision.</text>
