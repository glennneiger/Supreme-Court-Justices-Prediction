            <text syncTime="3349.767" offset="13567162">Mr. Taylor sought the same documents for exactly the same reason to be used to exactly the same end purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.389" offset="13593598">That should... I think... give the Petitioner a great deal of comfort in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.010" offset="13616063">We are not advocating nor is the government, a privity rule that is going to result in the widespread preclusion of FOIA plaintiffs who seeks the same documents for independent reasons; but when someone comes to the Court pressing someone else's interests, that is a square privity issue, and he should be barred.</text>

            <text syncTime="3395.609" offset="13750542">First, I want to address the two cases brought up by the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.872" offset="13767573">In Des Moines Valley Railroad that was someone who had the right to the land because of a grant from the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.276" offset="13797144">In that case, specifically, the Court pointed out that the government... that Congress had passed a law that had the government give up all interest, that showed that the government had given up all interests in the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.629" offset="13850538">And in the Rock Island Railroad case, that had to do with a beneficiary and the administrator of an estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.530" offset="13878228">These are legal relationships that give rise to privity, and that's exactly the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.702" offset="13906858">There are relationships that do give rise to privity, but the relationship between Taylor and Herrick is not one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.307" offset="13933294">The government also pointed out that FOIA requestors can bring suit in different venues, and that is the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.380" offset="13973627">They can bring it in the District of Columbia, where the records are, or where they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.897" offset="13987629">But as they pointed out, that is the way that FOIA is set up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.066" offset="14004347">Congress allowed requestors to bring suits in different places, and that's not the way Congress needed to establish FOIA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.140" offset="14032664">It could have made one place the sole venue for bringing suit under FOIA but it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.436" offset="14061817">And--</text>

            <text syncTime="3474.200" offset="14064847">What if two people get together who want the same documents for the same purpose, which is they think they're going to make money off of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.573" offset="14094313">And they say which ever gets it we'll share with the other and we'll split the money we're going to get?</text>

            <text syncTime="3495.846" offset="14151469">They just want to double their chances of getting the documents, but they agree to split.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.205" offset="14168919">They think they're going to make a hundred dollars off of this and agree to split it 50-50, regardless of who wins.</text>

            <text syncTime="3513.325" offset="14221373">But again, the facts here do not show that there is any agreement between Taylor and Herrick to... there's no agreement either to repair the plane; but more specifically, there are no agreements to bring this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.302" offset="14281245">So this Court does not need to reach the question of exactly what sort of agreement would lead to preclusion, and the problem with the lower court's decision here is that they did just look at a grab bag of amorphous factors to hold Taylor bound.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.155" offset="14348641">They talk about a close relationship without it being the sort of relationship under which one party is representing the other or under which they have a legal relationship.</text>

            <text syncTime="3581.312" offset="14493360">Do you think we need to remand this for consideration of whether or not there was an agreement, if we conclude that what we see from the court of appeals opinion isn't enough?</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.154" offset="14532648">As I understand, the court of appeals didn't think an agreement was necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.668" offset="14554695">So regardless of what the district court said, al thought that was an issue that was litigated, it was not passed on by the court of appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="3604.334" offset="14585415">The court could remand it and then the district court would have the discretion to allow the case to go forward as it saw fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.158" offset="14612687">And the problem... the problem with the factors looked at by the lower courts, with... basing privity on just amorphous facts and basically just having courts check their gut about whether or not that relationship is sufficient, is that it ends up with people being found in privity when they did not actually have their right to be heard, the way Taylor did not here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.213" offset="14720938">Instead, privity should be based on underlaying rationales that protect the litigant's right to be heard and ensure that they do have their day in court.</text>
