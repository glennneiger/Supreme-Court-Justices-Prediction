            <text syncTime="7.237" offset="191895">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Seventh Circuit has seriously misconstrued the Federal money laundering statute by interpreting the term "proceeds" to mean profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.259" offset="231914">The statute prohibits the laundering of all the gross receipts of a crime, not just its profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.580" offset="253230">The primary meaning of "proceeds" is gross receipts, and the statutory context makes clear that's the meaning Congress intended here.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.150" offset="283532">The statute is structured to prevent criminals from using the fruits of their crimes to promote or to conceal their illegal activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.708" offset="321775">But a profits definition of proceeds would constrict the statute in ways that can't be squared with that statutory objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.445" offset="356675">Because the word "proceeds" appears in the introductory section of the statute, those kinds of restrictions would apply to both concealment and promotion cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.068" offset="391157">For example, the statute wouldn't cover expense payments that are structured to conceal the unlawful nature and source of the funds involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.776" offset="433998">That means that if an illegal gambling operator recorded the compensation that he paid his collectors as salary payments by a legitimate business that he owned, that that would not be covered under the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="94.259" offset="539950">What we're arguing is that there is no reason that Congress wouldn't have covered these transactions and that they implicate the objectives of the statute as revealed by its text, just as much as the transactions that are clearly covered.</text>

            <label>Mr. Matthew D. Roberts</label>
            <text syncTime="129.616" offset="681325">--it is certainly true that illegal gambling and money laundering are going to occur together, but that isn't a cause for concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.103" offset="707343">It just reflects the fact that certain businesses, illegal businesses like gambling operations, like drug dealing, frequently generate large amounts of cash and they need to launder that cash in order to survive and to prosper.</text>

            <text syncTime="155.583" offset="785188">They're not... the money that's being paid to the runners and the collectors, it is an ordinary and necessary expense of the illegal business.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.474" offset="836806">So I think Justice Scalia was emphasizing that this is, for the very same conduct two discrete statutes, one with much heavier penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.751" offset="897932">That makes it odd, too, that the basic gambling statute has a lower penalty than this money laundering statute, and yet it's the same conduct that's violating both.</text>

            <label>Mr. Matthew D. Roberts</label>
            <text syncTime="1413.703" offset="5817730">I think there are many situations, as the Chief Justice pointed out, in which a profits definition isn't going to be enough to solve it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.559" offset="5849181">For instance, just a drug dealer accepts payment for the drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.813" offset="5870184">If that money exceeds the cost of the business, it would presumably be profit and without some other requirement in the statute, it would count as money laundering.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.151" offset="5911457">And for instance, when street-level dealers that are employed by a drug kingpin turn the receipts over to the kingpin even after they've take out their share, let's say... under a profits definition if those receipts exceeded the costs of the business that would also be covered as money laundering.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.898" offset="5986481">So I think it's very true that the profits definition isn't going to solve all the problems as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.569" offset="6017201">That's a... you know... another point about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.838" offset="6030262">It also means that what we have to prove profits that that's going to be very difficult for us to do even in cases that don't involve these expense payments because criminals often don't keep accounting records.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.978" offset="6074775">They certainly don't keep records that are accurate and complete and decipherable by law enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.965" offset="6094732">And Congress recognized the lack of hard evidence of criminal profits, and for that reason Congress provided for the forfeiture of proceeds rather than profits in the RICO and drug forfeiture statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.588" offset="6137260">And there's no reason to think Congress took a different approach here in the money laundering statute, two years later, when it used the same term "proceeds".</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.277" offset="6172055">There's also... there's the issue of the uncertainty that would be created by a profits definition, because it would raise all these questions, and there are no accounting rules to resolve them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.104" offset="6227330">And even the court below acknowledged that it's difficult to determine what is and isn't net income, and that the line between paying expenses and reinvesting that income is murky.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.494" offset="6268917">And I don't think the Court should lightly assume that Congress intended a definition of an element of the offense that's going to raise these numerous issues about the scope of that essential element of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.100" offset="6311340">And the Court is going to have to resolve them all without any guidance from Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="3028.197" offset="12275722">But, the money laundering statute is not designed to cure that evil.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.918" offset="12302575">That evil is punished and punished severely by the murder statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.838" offset="12322220">It is punished as the underlying crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.107" offset="12331310">And so in this case, Mr. Santos and Mr. Diaz... or Mr. Santos was punished up to the maximum of five years for running an illegal gambling business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.130" offset="12375405">He didn't do anything else other than run a gambling business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.867" offset="12394318">And so I think the point is at the end of the day, there are certainly a lot of hypothetical situations that suggest a profits construction might pose some burdens, might not make sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.091" offset="12443219">But if you're going to look at the burdens on the government in terms of construing the term "proceeds", then you also must look at the consequences of accepting the gross receipts construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.565" offset="12489194">And I think at the outset, nearly every justice up here suggested... well, that turns every illegal gambling business into a money laundering violation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3134.783" offset="12702040">And that different conduct is inherent in conducting a financial transaction with the intent to promote the carrying on of the unlawful activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.020" offset="12730984">I do not think that you can parse the statutory language and only address the term "proceeds" irrespective of its consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.625" offset="12765361">In fact, I think the questions directed to me as to the harsh consequences on the government approving profits shows that you have to look at the term "proceeds" in its context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.517" offset="12808933">In its context includes not only the burdens on the one hand, but it certainly includes the situation we have here, that every illegal gambling business is automatic money laundering.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.456" offset="12852714">And that is not what money laundering statute was enacted, it's not what it was written or intended to address.</text>

            <text syncTime="3190.167" offset="12923558">If I could first address the reasons why this Court should not decide the separate transaction issue itself in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.154" offset="12951562">First of all, it's not the question presented here which is limited to the meaning of the statutory term "proceeds".</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.225" offset="12975803">Respondents didn't present any alternative question in their briefs in opposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.427" offset="12992626">And, in fact, they don't present an alternative question presented even in their briefs on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.497" offset="13012897">They're just using the concern about merger as a reason to decide that proceeds means profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.335" offset="13044244">The separate transaction issue was decided against Respondents adversely on direct appeal in the Febus case, as my brother on the other side acknowledged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.808" offset="13090115">And those kinds of issues that are decided adversely on direct appeal shouldn't be relitigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.362" offset="13112371">The issue wasn't raised in the separate transaction issue, it wasn't raised in the Section 2255 issues, and wasn't addressed by the courts below in these collateral proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.568" offset="13149152">At most, we say it should be left open for another case that presents... that presents the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.824" offset="13178200">Beyond that, if this Court thought that something should be left open for the court below to address, the court below could address a range of possible ways to deal with ensuring a separation, for example, Justice Stevens's suggestion that an illegal gambling business under the statute itself entails the payment of winners and the payment of employees, although we don't think that it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.859" offset="13302334">But a profits definition is not the way to address concerns about overlap for the underlying offense, because it makes no sense in the broader context of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.632" offset="13337442">It would create significant uncertainty about the scope of the statute because of the absence of accounting rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.084" offset="13359281">It would make proof very difficult as a general matter because of the absence of those rules and because criminals often don't keep accounting records.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.272" offset="13391986">It would exclude numerous concealment transactions that Congress had no reason not to cover, and it would cripple the government's ability to prosecute professional money launderers, which are really a significant part of the problem that Congress was addressing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.615" offset="13449351">If the Court has no further questions, we would ask that the judgments of the court of appeals be reversed.</text>
