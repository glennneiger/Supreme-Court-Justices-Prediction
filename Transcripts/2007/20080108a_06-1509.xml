            <text syncTime="8.384" offset="204353">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress placed the phrase 301(a) of the Internal Revenue Code to make clear that the taxation rules in Section 301(c) do not apply to corporate payments that a shareholder receives in a nonshareholder capacity.</text>

            <text syncTime="27.395" offset="280421">May I ask you a question which is going to come up sooner or later?</text>
            <text syncTime="31.597" offset="297244">And it's kind of a threshold question.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.127" offset="303409">So, if I may, let me interrupt you with it now.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.095" offset="315216">You emphasize the significance of the limiting condition "with respect to the stock".</text>
            <text syncTime="42.765" offset="341966">But before you get to that phrase, Section 301 refers to a distribution by the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.652" offset="373522">And my question is this: Let's assume that we... we accept your... your position that the circuit was wrong in requiring an offer of proof of intent to return capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.786" offset="437992">Isn't it also the case that you would still have an obligation, if you're going to take advantage of this section, to offer some evidence with respect to the fact that there was a corporate distribution involved?</text>
            <text syncTime="82.671" offset="501522">And as I understand it, your evidence is or the Government's evidence and yours is that, you know, there was skimming, there was misdirection, et cetera, but there was no indication, there's no evidence that there was any distribution, in the normal sense of that word, by a corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.366" offset="580307">So it seems to me that if you... if you win the case in the sense of convincing us that the circuit was wrong with respect to the specific intent requirement, you would still be left without a defense because you have not come forward with any evidence that indicates a distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.373" offset="652405">Am I wrong?</text>

            <text syncTime="125.606" offset="673303">Although I agree that the question of a distribution is important, and I think implicit in that question, in that term, although the courts have not addressed it, is some sort of corporate action.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.023" offset="714994">Where you have a controlling shareholder, as we do here with Mr. Boulware, who is a 50 percent share owner, he's the president, he's the founder, he dominates this company, his action is action on behalf of the corporation.</text>

            <text syncTime="152.563" offset="781136">Well, it certainly can be, and there's no question about that, but isn't there some point of informality or some point, I guess, of formality or relevance to corporate practice that has to be reached?</text>
            <text syncTime="166.480" offset="836829">In other words, he may keep lousy books, he may be very sloppy, but directing funds to one's girlfriend is not the act of a corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.538" offset="881029">And it seems to me that the kind of... of actions that he took to get or to direct the payment of moneys could not, by any stretch of the imagination, be regarded as an act of this corporation or of any corporation.</text>

            <text syncTime="195.937" offset="954589">With respect, Justice Souter, Justice Souter, I disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.967" offset="966710">There are, I've discovered, hundreds of corporate diversion cases involving a very similar fact pattern and a very similar fact pattern to this, where have you a corporation that is really the creature of one person.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.150" offset="1019478">It's formed by one person.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.304" offset="1024075">He chose the corporate form, but in effect he is the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.226" offset="1043719">That's the case of Mr. Boulware and it's the case in a lot of these diversion cases, and--</text>

          <turn speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="222.114" stopTime="232.328">
            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="222.114" offset="1059288">Well, in this case, he's a 50 percent owner, as I understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.409" offset="1072454">He formed the corporation, but isn't 50 percent of the stock owned by the trust for the love child of him and the girlfriend?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_d_cline" startTime="232.328" stopTime="297.380">
            <label>Mr. John D. Cline</label>
            <text syncTime="232.328" offset="1100144">--It is indeed, although it's important to keep in mind that the girlfriend, according to the Government's evidence, received a very large chunk of this money.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.198" offset="1139641">So in effect what we have here is a situation where you not only have a 50 percent shareholder who dominates the corporation; the other 50 percent... the trustee for the other 50 percent shareholder is the recipient of the money and is certainly knowledgeable about most, if not all, of what's going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.209" offset="1199723">But in these circumstances where you have a close corporation typically run very informally, as this one was, with one person who dominates it, the courts have uniformly taken the view that, the Tax Court has and for that matter the Government has in every case except this one, that when the controlling dominant shareholder takes money from his corporation, that's a distribution by the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.104" offset="1307243">And although... Your Honor, I had thought about this question myself before you raised it.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.024" offset="1322916">The cases don't pause on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.711" offset="1333678">They move directly to the question of whether it's taken in some other capacity, as compensation, for example, or as a loan.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="297.380" offset="1360428">Well, perhaps because... because the Government might very well be on the other side of that question, that is the dominant shareholder takes money from the corporation, gives it to his girlfriend, and the Government is saying that corporation had earnings and profits, we want to tax this as a dividend to you.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. John D. Cline</label>
            <text syncTime="319.902" offset="1450498">Well, yes, Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.604" offset="1465231">The way this often comes up, the Government usually takes the opposite position--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="329.023" stopTime="329.242">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="329.023" offset="1486965">Yes.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_d_cline" startTime="329.242" stopTime="403.149">
            <label>Mr. John D. Cline</label>
            <text syncTime="329.242" offset="1487801">--to what it's taken here.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.898" offset="1490413">It usually takes our position, and here's the reason why: First of all, a lot of times, as in this case, some of the money that is coming toward the corporation is intercepted by the controlling shareholder.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.956" offset="1534717">And the question then is, was it ever income to the corporation?</text>
            <text syncTime="343.596" offset="1545270">Well, of course, the Government wants to say that it was because they want to tax it twice, at the corporate level and then again at the individual level.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.733" offset="1569825">And the issue there again is one of control.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.607" offset="1581319">If it's the controlling shareholder, even though he gets the money before it ever hits the corporate bank account.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.324" offset="1600127">It's considered income to the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.136" offset="1611412">It also comes up when the corporation wants to claim a theft deduction or embezzlement deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.368" offset="1640356">That again is a common fact pattern in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.601" offset="1653313">The corporation... everything comes to light, the IRS conducts its investigation, now the corporation wants to avoid its tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.629" offset="1685391">Sure the individual is going to get taxed, but it wants to avoid its tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.252" offset="1699915">And so, it claims that there was a theft or an embezzlement by the shareholder and it's entitled to a deduction and shouldn't have to pay tax on that money.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.154" offset="1735442">And again, the Government uniformly takes the position that a controlling shareholder, such as Mr. Boulware, can't embezzle from his own corporation, which is essentially the position that we're taking here.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="403.149" stopTime="443.306">
            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="403.149" offset="1783507">Well, it may be that he cannot embezzle in the sense of committing a separate private act or even a separate, a separate tort that the corporation could object to.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.191" offset="1831677">But the question still remains... excuse me... whether the act of, of taking the money in this unorthodox way could be regarded as a corporate act within the meaning of the term "distribution".</text>
            <text syncTime="431.060" offset="1895102">And I think I understand your point, but I guess the only point that I'm making is the fact that it may not qualify as embezzlement, civilly or criminally, does not necessarily answer the objection that I'm raising.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_d_cline" startTime="443.306" stopTime="479.901">
            <label>Mr. John D. Cline</label>
            <text syncTime="443.306" offset="1944108">I agree with that point, Justice Souter.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.805" offset="1950064">But one other point I would emphasize is that I think if you start to say that an act by the controlling shareholder, which is Mr. Boulware, does not constitute a distribution by his corporation, there are going to be unintended consequences of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.596" offset="2013280">One of which is that in a situation where a controlling shareholder such as Mr. Boulware intercepts money coming into the corporation, you're going to have the corporation coming in and arguing that that interception, that taking in of money wasn't an act of the corporation, and so, there is no income to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.949" offset="2074616">And I think that's why the courts in a whole series--</text>

            <text syncTime="484.290" offset="2108052">But you did say something about the interception that... your argument is that this corporation had no earnings and profits, so what the shareholder got was a return of capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.455" offset="2176702">But part of what was involved was he was taking, I thought, receipts for goods that customers were... had paid and giving them to the girlfriend.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.822" offset="2250158">In determining whether that corporation had any earnings and profits, wouldn't you have to credit the corporation?</text>
            <text syncTime="527.927" offset="2282550">In other words, did you prove that there was no... that there were no earnings and profits?</text>
