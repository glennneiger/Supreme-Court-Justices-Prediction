            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="10.309" offset="208886">Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Six years ago, this Court in Buckman recognized that policing fraud against Federal agencies is hardly a field the states have traditionally occupied.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.683" offset="370427">Based on that premise, this Court in Buckman struck down a novel State tort that was based on the whole concept of fraud on the FDA.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.711" offset="406476">And the Court concluded that that tortious analysis as a matter of State law would inevitably conflict with the FDA's responsibility to police fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.581" offset="445973">A responsibility that the Court recognized was essentially cradle to grave covered by Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.111" offset="468125">It arises out of Federal law, it is regulated by Federal law and it is ultimately terminated by Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.296" offset="488814">Michigan has adopted a unique product liability statute, and on the one hand confers a very broad immunity of defense against all product liability claims for manufacturers who comply with the FDA's requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.275" offset="544716">But then on the other hand, withdraws that immunity for the defense, this is PDA App. 42A, if the manufacturer intentionally withholds from or misrepresents to the United States Food and Drug Administration information concerning the drug that is required to be submitted pursuant to... and then it goes and lists very specific provisions of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act... and the drug would not have been approved or the Food and Drug Administration would have withdrawn approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.888" offset="659237">It is difficult for me to imagine a statute that would more consciously and openly tread into exactly the same territory that this Court declared in Buckman as a matter of exclusive Federal and concern not available to the states to regulate.</text>

            <text syncTime="137.773" offset="718796">Mr. Phillips, what if the statute didn't have that provision, but it just said you can bring a State tort action when the conditions approved by the FDA for the marketing of this drug have not been complied with?</text>
            <text syncTime="157.374" offset="797164">That's all it says.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.999" offset="803642">Now, would you knowledge that that... that that suit could be brought?</text>

            <text syncTime="163.137" offset="820256">I will acknowledge that's a fundamentally different issue, Justice Scalia, because there you are talking about what duties are owed to the public that are enforced by the FDA and potentially are enforceable by the states as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.148" offset="872292">But here we're talking about duties that are owed from the manufacturer exclusively--</text>

            <text syncTime="180.896" offset="891204">It's a duty that is defined by the FDA.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.753" offset="906669">And I didn't hear your answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.487" offset="913565">Would that suit be allowable or not?</text>

            <text syncTime="188.909" offset="923283">--That suit would not be barred, I don't think, by Buckman.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.437" offset="941464">I think the question there will really go to what the Court is going to decide next term in Wyeth as to how far when if you have FDA approval of certain activities that that has the effect of--</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="204.136" offset="984200">It doesn't seem to me... what I worry about is that if we say in this case it treads too much into the FDA's own responsibility to say what material should have been provided to the FDA, it seems to me the next what could be more central to the FDA... to the FDA's job than determining whether the conditions the FDA prescribed for the marketing of the drug have indeed been observed?</text>
            <text syncTime="233.827" offset="1103005">That's central as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="235.046" offset="1107812">--I don't think it is an unreasonable next step, but it is clearly the next step that has to be taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.748" offset="1126620">Because what this Court decided in Buckman... and it's central and candidly we are here seeking a very narrow ruling from the Court is that when you're defining the relationship between the manufacturer and the seller of the drugs and the FDA in terms of the disclosure of information to that entity and the determination both whether that information is adequate to allow the agency to perform its business and then, more fundamentally, whether or not the agency is acting in accordance with its own exclusive authority to decide how to proceed--</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="271.562" offset="1253888">But one can also reason in the opposite direction; that is to say, one can know from the medical devices portion of the FDA that Congress has no objection to private tort actions that... where the medical device manufacturer has not observed the requirements that the FDA's approval impose, right?</text>
            <text syncTime="297.927" offset="1359423">We know from that section that Congress has no objection to that there.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.581" offset="1373947">You can probably guess that Congress has no objection to it in the... in the drug field as well as the medical devices field.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.296" offset="1416893">And if I make that guess, what is so different about having a jury second-guess the provision of information portion?</text>

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="323.932" offset="1463390">--It seems to me that the same argument you just made, Justice Scalia, would have led the Court to the opposite result in Buckman, because what's the... you know, if Congress didn't care about allowing State tort law to be... to serve as the enforcement mechanism, then why wouldn't you allow them to do that in that context as well?</text>
            <text syncTime="341.565" offset="1533921">And this Court said the reason is because there is a very uniquely Federal interest in taking care of the business and the relationship between those two entities.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="350.687" offset="1570388">Well, It is... it is more of a stick in the eye of the Federal Government to create a cause of action that consists of defrauding the Federal Government, which is what was at issue in Buckman.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.698" offset="1610408">The very cause of action was providing false information to the FDA.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.617" offset="1634127">Here the cause of action is a standard tort cause of action for marketing a defective product.</text>

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="371.819" offset="1654920">Well, when you say "here" what we're talking... what we're talking about here is a very unique State statute that is the sole basis on which the tort liability is set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.112" offset="1704135">We're not... we're not pre-empting the underlying tort claims by the Federal law that's at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.670" offset="1730362">The State statute pre-empts the common law court claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.934" offset="1747394">That first portion of the defense wipes those out.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.667" offset="1758365">So it's not pre-emption of the traditional State law cause of action, as the Second Circuit wrongly evaluated it.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.962" offset="1779472">What we're talking about here is a provision that in the most exquisite terms says: Allow the State, either by the court or the juries, to evaluate the adequacy of the information that the FDA required.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.113" offset="1832135">And it's important to understand how that plays out, because what it says is pursuant to those statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.095" offset="1856063">It specifically identifies provisions in the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.844" offset="1867035">It doesn't say anything about how the FDA... how the FDA interprets those statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="471.371" offset="2053131">Instead of just saying you show regulatory compliance, we're going to take you off the hook altogether, except if you didn't come clean with the FDA, if you withheld information or misrepresented information.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.270" offset="2140693">It seems to me that what... you could say this is just like Buckman, but you could also say this is giving the manufacturer an invigorated regulatory compliance defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.906" offset="2187296">So why shouldn't it be looked at as the second, rather than the first?</text>

            <text syncTime="545.358" offset="2349046">The problem here is that the Federal Government has an independent interest, and it is the Federal Government's independent interest that is being essentially wiped away.</text>

            <text syncTime="552.466" offset="2377572">If you're right in your argument, the Michigan statute provided two things: One good for the manufacturer, immunity; two, a qualification on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.757" offset="2426682">It seems to me that those two can't be unstuck.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.161" offset="2444341">So to strike out one, as was done in the Sixth Circuit case, and not the other is certainly not faithful to the Michigan legislature that put these two things together.</text>

            <text syncTime="591.247" offset="2532635">And I... but I think it's not fair to condemn the way the Sixth Circuit analyzed this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.415" offset="2553324">What the Sixth Circuit said is if it's still available to the State to come in after the FDA has both found that there has been a material deception of one sort or another and that the FDA has decided to withdraw the product as a consequence of that, and that... and then State law is allowed to come in and enforce product liability claims under those circumstances, that the legislature would have been perfectly satisfied with that arrangement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1580.800" offset="6490917">Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Warner-Lambert marketed a defective product.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.890" offset="6527175">It withheld information about the injury the product could cause, and the product caused injury to a great many patients, including Respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.590" offset="6554029">They sued Warner-Lambert alleging traditional State law claims, such as product defect and failure to warn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.025" offset="6579733">I'd like to begin by explaining why the misrepresentation exception to the Michigan defense does not implicate the concerns that were raised by the Court in Buckman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.989" offset="6627590">Specifically, the Court in Buckman identified three problems or concerns that it thought warranted pre-emption in that case: That the claim alleged would cause companies to submit too much information and slow down the 510(k) process; that the claim alleged might cause companies not to submit products for approval because of concern about off-label use; and that the claim would cause an unwarranted intrusion on the FDA's decisionmaking about how to police and enforce fraud against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.520" offset="6789758">So the question is: Does the Michigan law implicate these three concerns any more than traditional State tort litigation against a drug company?</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.281" offset="6832808">I'll start with what I think are the easy ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.139" offset="6848272">For three reasons, the Michigan statute creates no incentive for manufacturers to submit unnecessary information to the FDA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.636" offset="6886202">Unlike the streamlined 510(k) clearance process that was at issue in Buckman, in this case we have a drug approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.740" offset="6926639">Drugs are required to go through a comprehensive pre-market approval process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.707" offset="6946493">The regulations require submission of,</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.846" offset="6963002">"all available information about the safety of a drug, including demonstrated or potential adverse effects. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.108" offset="7000096">I was quoting from 314.50(b)(5).</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.154" offset="7016292">As Warner-Lambert points out in its brief, a typical new drug application can be thousands of pages long.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.446" offset="7041474">So there's not really... not only is there not evidence that this 12-year-old statute will lead companies to submit information that the FDA doesn't want and doesn't need; but it's really unclear what such evidence would be because, after all, companies are required to submit all safety information to the FDA, and it's safety information that would be relevant to a finding under the Michigan exception.</text>
