            <text syncTime="11.622" offset="221219">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This appeal presents two issues, both a threshold jurisdictional question and a substantive question concerning scope of section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.411" offset="264374">We have explained in some detail in our briefs why Governor Riley's appeal in this case is timely and why this Court has jurisdiction to resolve the merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.534" offset="296870">The Solicitor General has agreed with us on the jurisdictional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.385" offset="308364">I certainly want to answer any questions that the Court may have concerning the jurisdictional issue, but with the Court's permission I would like to proceed in my affirmative presentation directly to the merits, and specifically the second of two independent bases that we have urged for reversal here.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.045" offset="362908">Our argument under this Court's decision in Young versus Fordice is perhaps the simplest and most straightforward way to resolve this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.317" offset="400002">In Young, this Court held that a state voter registration plan, despite its promulgation, preclearance and active implementation to register 4,000 voters, was nonetheless in force or effect within the meaning of section 5 and thus was not a valid section 5 baseline for purposes of measuring future changes, because the Court said it resulted only from a temporary misapplication of State law and it was immediately corrected upon acknowledgment that it was unlawful in fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="88.286" offset="527897">It's pretty hard to argue something wasn't in force and effect when they have an election under it, isn't it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Kevin C. Newsom</label>
            <text syncTime="93.190" offset="547541">Your Honor, I don't think... Your Honor is correct that the only possible distinction between Young and this case is the holding of the 1987 election, but I don't think the election can make the difference here, for this reason: It preceded solely by virtue of the vagaries of the State litigation process.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.886" offset="614310">The challenge preceded the election by two months.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.338" offset="628103">That election was conducted under a cloud of litigation that everyone certainly knew about and it went forward only because, in the wake of Young, the trial court temporarily misapplied State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.878" offset="674287">If a trial court had gotten State law right to begin with, Your Honor, and had enjoined the election as we now all know it should have, then there never would have been the election to point to as evidence that 85-237 ever went into force or effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.638" offset="729353">And it seems to me inconceivable, consistent with any meaningful notion of federalism, that section 5 can require a world in which a State trial court, as we say in the reply brief, which exists at the bottom of the state judicial hierarchy, can by getting State law wrong in the first place lock into State law as a section 5 baseline an unconstitutional statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.270" offset="831858">I don't anybody, on this side of the podium anyway, to be denying that 85-237 was, is now and was at its inception, unconstitutional and thereby strip the Alabama Supreme Court of its sovereign prerogative to correct the errors of lower courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="198.843" offset="970098">There are... we have pitched two different arguments in this case, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.580" offset="989115">And under the, I think it's fair, to say the broader of the two arguments, contained in Roman II of our brief, that, the later action, nonetheless would not be a change under section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.286" offset="1027881">But under the argument that I was talking about specifically under Young versus Fordice, I think it does make a difference that the Alabama Supreme Court stepped in at the earliest possible opportunity to invalidate this statute, again as part of litigation that preceded the first and only implementation, attempted implementation, of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.713" offset="1093605">And I think the question at bottom here in this case is whether section 5 provides State courts with any breathing space whatsoever in which to conduct this exercise of judicial review, and our submission is that at the very least that it ought to extend so far as to allow State courts to step in, as they did here, at the earliest possible opportunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="330.410" offset="1496413">They just hold the judgment in abeyance until there is preclearance, and couldn't... and if so, couldn't do you that here?</text>

            <text syncTime="344.251" offset="1551793">So I don't want the Court to think that our position here is that courts are having to... to render sort of provisional judgments that are then subject to preclearance in Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.960" offset="1606650">The point is that, so I think in the redistricting example, Your Honor, it would be the implementation of the redistricting that would require preclearance.</text>

            <text syncTime="376.205" offset="1679584">No Your Honor, and the point is that no one here denies, certainly the State does not deny, that a State court order redistricting, redrawing a map, in essence, and giving rise or exercising what is functionally, as this Court has said, a legislative power requires redistricting.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.816" offset="1750010">No one doubts that.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.733" offset="1753667">But the question here is quite different: Whether if there is a spectrum of State court decisions with redistricting at one end, my case has to be at the other end of the spectrum.</text>

            <text syncTime="474.035" offset="2070898">In other words, you're trying to make the case here that there is something extremely unusual about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.624" offset="2101304">And I thought your answer to Justice Scalia in effect was one reason that it's unusual is that we don't have any of these cases in, in which a State court has knocked out a State law that is then subject to some kind of preclearance review.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.853" offset="2174238">And my only point was, if I understand the situation, as long as the preclearance review had not preceded the State constitutionality judgment, following the State constitutionality judgment there would be no law to take to Washington, whether it be to... to the Justice Department or to... or to the Court, and ask to have precleared.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.687" offset="2285520">So the fact that there are no such cases doesn't prove anything.</text>

            <text syncTime="1281.872" offset="5302245">But with respect to the specific question at issue here, whether Congress was in enacting section 5, was clued into this question and it had reason to think that State Court exercises of judicial review would give rise to the sorts of problems that section 5 was designed to inhibit, there simply is nothing to support that suggestion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.368" offset="5384269">Section 5, of course, was intended to do something very specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.970" offset="5398689">It was designed to prevent or to catch government conduct that the more traditional remedies in place at the time under the '57, '60 and '64 Civil Rights Acts, what we would today I think call a section 2 suit, couldn't get.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.794" offset="5449993">And the point here, in addition to the Danforth that at some deep jurisprudential level courts don't change law, the more important practical point is that courts exercising judicial review are institutionally incapable of changing the law specifically in the way that Congress was concerned about when it enacted Section 5.</text>

            <text syncTime="1664.147" offset="6831348">And I would like to direct the Court's attention to page 101 of the joint appendix, because the language I'm going to be talking about appears there in the course of the Governor's request for reconsideration of DOJ's objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.488" offset="6876697">This is the language from this Court's opinion in Young against Fordice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.757" offset="6889758">And it starts midway down the page, where the Court says that:</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.844" offset="6910134">"The simple fact that a voting practice is unlawful under State law does not show entirely by itself that the practice was never in force or effect. "</text>

            <text syncTime="1693.966" offset="6950676">And then the Court goes on to say:</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.618" offset="6957259">"A State, after all, might maintain in effect for many years a plan that technically or in one respect or another violated some provision of State law. "</text>

            <text syncTime="1733.393" offset="7108351">"This Act shall become effective immediately upon its passage and approval by the Governor upon its otherwise becoming a law. "</text>

            <text syncTime="1761.161" offset="7219424">And this also goes to the question that Justice Ginsburg asked at the very end of the argument about the remedy in this case, because Alabama law here is quite peculiar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.500" offset="7252756">And since we filed our brief there have been two opinions by the Alabama Supreme Court, in a case called Roper against Rhodes and a case called Wood against Booth, that reiterated under Alabama law once an election has been held, if no contest litigation was timely brought, the fact that the person is unentitled to remain in office does not allow contest after the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.099" offset="7343139">So we have a peculiar problem in this case, which is, even if this Court were to reverse, there was an election held here pursuant to Alabama Act 2006-342 that was conceivably valid under Alabama law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.192" offset="7403535">And the question whether to replace Merceria Ludgood who won that election, as you noted, by a four to one margin, with either Juan Chastang or somebody else is quite up in the air.</text>

            <text syncTime="2137.306" offset="8723972">But let me explain it with a hypothetical that might make this clearer, which is: Suppose you had a State in which people were voting in an election, and then the State supreme court held that that part of the county had never been properly annexed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.234" offset="8783740">The State would be required to continue letting those people vote in the election unless and until it received preclearance from the Department of Justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="2288.299" offset="9327923">If you're going to say that that little bit counts as putting it in force and effect, you know what we're going to have?</text>

            <label>Ms. Pamela S. Karlan</label>
            <text syncTime="2309.195" offset="9411515">Well, there are two factual points in response to your question, Justice Breyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.581" offset="9429069">The first is, with respect to Perkins against Matthews, the Mississippi statute that required the use of at large rather than district elections was passed in 1962 and used precisely once before the preclearance, so it was on all fours with this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.840" offset="9486121">It was a three year lag between the unconstitutionality of the City of Canton's practice and the preclearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.129" offset="9523319">So if we were to ask what does our case look most like that this Court has already decided, it would be Perkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.350" offset="9548188">The second point which I want to direct the Court to is we are not actually talking in this case... and this goes as well to the Court's judicial function... about just Act 85-237.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.472" offset="9588625">We are also talking in this case about Act 2004-215, which was the attempt by the Alabama Legislature to revise the constitutionality of Act 85-237.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.779" offset="9633869">Because the central problem in this case was a provision of the Alabama Constitution, Section 105, that said you couldn't pass local legislation unless the act... unless the general act made that very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.354" offset="9684233">So in 2004 the Alabama legislature thought it had solved the entire problem here by amending the section of chapter 11 of the Alabama election law to say unless a local law provides otherwise you can use gubernatorial appointment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.533" offset="9748913">That law was intended to revive Act 85-237.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.437" offset="9772527">We know this because, among other things, our clients were the sponsors of the act, among the sponsors of the act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2407.741" offset="9805755">If I could just ask you, in making that argument, aren't you asking us to say that the purpose of this act... that the intent of the Alabama legislature in passing that act is different from the intent as determined by the Alabama Supreme Court?</text>

            <text syncTime="2426.254" offset="9879838">It's because the claim of the State is that this is a case about fundamental constitutional provisions of Alabama law, but in fact in its current guise, which is whether the 2004 Act revived the 1985 Act, this is purely a matter of statutory construction and what the Alabama Supreme Court said is: We don't think the legislature meant to make this law retroactive; we think they meant to make it only prospective.</text>

            <text syncTime="2488.328" offset="10128106">And that's this Court's decision in Hathorn against Lovorn and this Court's decision in Branch against Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.065" offset="10150989">In both of those cases as well, you had the question, quite acutely in Hathorn against Lovorn, of whether or not the chancery court in Mississippi, which is a trial level court, got the law right or wrong on whether elections should be conducted in a particular way in Warren County.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.610" offset="10221206">The Mississippi Supreme Court said they got it wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.076" offset="10231028">But this Court said that decision and the implementation require preclearance because the presence of a court decree doesn't exempt a contested change from section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.886" offset="10282333">So in this case, had Governor Riley decided completely by himself that he, having taken an oath to support the Alabama constitution, could not in good conscience let a special election go forward here, it would be no different from having the Alabama Supreme Court decide that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3227.637" offset="13085272">You know, some people registered and then immediately they were told the registration was no good.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.091" offset="13103139">So it wasn't in force and effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.291" offset="13111917">When I looked at Perkins v. Matthews, that was not a case where the law was challenged immediately.</text>

            <text syncTime="3254.055" offset="13191015">So even if it might have been unconstitutional or it was, it was still in effect for three years.</text>

            <text syncTime="3289.961" offset="13334584">So what harm does it do to the enforcement of the civil rights laws of the United States if the holding of this Court were, well, under these circumstances, where challenged immediately, et cetera, it never took force and effect?</text>

            <text syncTime="3312.043" offset="13422983">The first is whether this practice was in effect for long enough for it to have been in force or effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.614" offset="13445239">The governing precedent on that issue is Young versus Fordice.</text>

            <text syncTime="3322.399" offset="13464361">There is not simply the partial implementation of voter registration procedures for a very brief period of time, a matter of weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.220" offset="13491633">An election was actually held and if that is not sufficient to satisfy the "in force or effect" requirement, it's hard to see what would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.109" offset="13523188">The second question is whether a practice can be said to be in force or effect when it was void ab initio as a matter of State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.464" offset="13556625">And we do respectfully submit that the City of Lockhart and Perkins answer that question because in both of those case the Court held that the relevant question was whether the practice was actually in effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="3387.641" offset="13725376">But I want to make two additional points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.410" offset="13732377">The first is that the question of whether the statute covers reversion to coverage date practices is really not properly before the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3407.272" offset="13803848">The question presented focuses solely on the question of whether changes precipitated by State court decisions require preclearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.476" offset="13832687">And that's a question that this Court has answered twice in Hathorn and Branch.</text>

            <text syncTime="3482.370" offset="14104256">And this Court has a line of cases in the section 5 area that says that it is really incumbent on covered jurisdictions when they seek preclearance clearly to identify the relevant change in their voting practices when they come to the attorney general for preclearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.646" offset="14165383">And when the 1985 act was submitted for preclearance, there was nary a word in the Alabama attorney general's submission that there was any potential difficulty with the statute under State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.488" offset="14212717">And so, the attorney general precluded on the understandable understanding that the statute simply affected a shift to special elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.527" offset="14244899">And I do think that the great price of Appellant's interpretation is if the court were to adopt it, it would suddenly shift the burden to the Federal attorney general or the D.C. District Court to when they receive a preclearance submission, essentially assess the meaning and validity of any State statute, lest the State statute be construed differently by a State court, and thus, lock in the preclearance court or attorney general.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.342" offset="14344165">And we believe that that problem along with this Court's decision in Branch and Hawthorne support our interpretation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3620.744" offset="14657739">It's now been extended through 2031 with no amendment of the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.945" offset="14674562">So it might have made some sense as a hard requirement in 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.432" offset="14692534">It makes much less practical sense, I recognize, today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.718" offset="14705595">But the language is what the language is I'm sorry.</text>

            <text syncTime="3645.626" offset="14757317">It doesn't strike me that the underlying method of how the election might have operated if the rule were election should matter, the rule was gubernatorial appointment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3654.984" offset="14794725">The rule is by virtue of these decisions gubernatorial appointment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.186" offset="14807473">If I may, just a couple of housekeeping items.</text>
            <text syncTime="3659.919" offset="14814473">Justice Ginsburg, the question of what DOJ was asked to preclear here is crystal clear from the district court's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.172" offset="14839446">On August 18, 2006, this three judge court held that two Alabama Supreme Court decisions Stokes v. Noonan and Riley v. Kennedy must be precleared before they can be... so the notion that the State was not asked to preclear judicial decisions is simply incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.665" offset="14901409">The second thing I'd like to mention just briefly is that the Federalism exacerbation here exists in a very real way for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3691.704" offset="14941637">The entire legislative and litigation history of section 5 has been about legislative and administrative change.</text>
            <text syncTime="3697.792" offset="14965984">Even with respect to those sorts of changes, this Court has said most recently and most forcefully in Presley that that application of section 5 even there works an extraordinary change of the traditional course of relations between the states and the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3712.351" offset="15024184">So the... to this point to be sure the Court has been willing to accept that extraordinary departure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3717.255" offset="15043828">The question in this case, however, is whether this extraordinary departure ought to become this extraordinary departure to account for this new category, this new universe of changes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3726.211" offset="15079668">Why as a matter of Federalism is it more extraordinary to review a court determination than the determination of a popularly elected legislature?</text>

            <text syncTime="3735.567" offset="15117076">Well, Your Honor, there are two pieces of this, really.</text>
            <text syncTime="3739.185" offset="15131495">That's more extraordinary simply in a quantitative sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3742.037" offset="15142885">We are talking about a lot more changes, so in sheer numbers we have got an exacerbation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3746.940" offset="15162529">But it's also in a qualitative sense the sense that we are living in a post Marbury, post Cooper versus Aaron, post Bernie world in which State courts just like Federal courts are tasked with finally deciding what State law means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3762.034" offset="15222924">And so, there is a very real difference, I think, in upsetting the considered judgment of a State court with respect to what State court... with respect to what State law means than there is--</text>

            <text syncTime="3771.323" offset="15260018">But they are not saying State law is different from what it means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3774.025" offset="15270885">They are saying that you cannot put a change in effect until you get it precleared.</text>

            <text syncTime="3779.462" offset="15292619">But with respect I think that that doesn't do justice to the functional reality of what's going on here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3786.350" offset="15320204">In 1988 the Alabama Supreme Court says, may I, says in Stokes versus Noonan that 85-237 is and always was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3795.957" offset="15358552">We have an issue of doctrine that's simply part of Alabama law and, again, I don't think anybody here seriously disputes that 85-237 was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3804.327" offset="15392093">And 20 years later DOJ steps in and refuses to bless that determination, and to be sure, is not meddling around in the intricacies of state law but the functional equivalent is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3814.466" offset="15432635">They set that judgment aside, and notwithstanding the Stokes court invalidation of that, DOJ says very clearly in its objection letters that 85-237, despite its invalidation, remains in full force and effect.</text>
