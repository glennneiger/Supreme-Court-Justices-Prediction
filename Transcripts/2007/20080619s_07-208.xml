            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104794">The second case -- the third case is not so complicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4.756" offset="123811">Here, a state court, that's Indiana v. Edwards, a state court found the criminal defendant in this case competent to stand trial if he was represented by counsel, mentally competent.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.355" offset="174175">But he is not mentally competent to conduct the trial proceedings himself without a counsel, that’s what the trial judge said.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.072" offset="205000">The Indiana State Supreme Court concluded that this Court's precedents don't allow that, that they require the trial court to allow the defendant, nonetheless, to conduct the trial proceedings himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.111" offset="265186">So, we have to decide whether that’s so.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.780" offset="275844">Does the constitution forbid a State from insisting that the defendant like this who the State thinks is not competent mentally to conduct the proceedings himself?</text>
            <text syncTime="54.703" offset="323596">Does it forbid a State for insisting that such a defendant proceed to trial with a lawyer, not without one?</text>
            <text syncTime="61.726" offset="351599">Thereby, denying the defendant the right to represent himself under the Sixth Amendment which we have explained the case called Faretta.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.742" offset="383677">We conclude that the State may insist a defendant be represented by counsel where that defendant is not mentally competent to conduct the trial proceedings himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.525" offset="426832">First, in our view, the relevant precedents do not decide the question presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.594" offset="447103">They assume the constitutional right of self representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.357" offset="462149">They assume that that right set forth in Faretta can be limited in various ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.091" offset="485137">Second, the mental competency that a defendant needs to represent himself during the trial, can differ dramatically from the mental competency he needs to proceed to trial with a lawyer, and third, to permit a defendant to represent himself a trial when he is mentally incompetent to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.866" offset="560161">In our opinion, does not at all affirmed that defendant's dignity but rather it threatens to undermine the most basic of the constitution's criminal law objectives, namely, providing a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.916" offset="620451">We add that the trial judge is in the best position to determine the presence or degree of the defendant’s mental competence.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.455" offset="646574">And we conclude that the State may insist that a criminal defendant be represented by counsel at the trial when that defendant who is mentally competent to stand trial with a lawyer, is not mentally competent to stand trial without one.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.273" offset="713865">And these points which are a little abstract, are very concretely and very well-represented by the facts of this case right before us which are explained in the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.426" offset="758482">So, we vacate the decision of the Indiana Supreme Court and remand for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.836" offset="780112">Justice Scalia has filed a dissenting opinion which Justice Thomas has joined.</text>
