            <text syncTime="383.580" offset="1702618">One, the favoritism in the first example, the dairy cases, which have come up a million times, is a favoritism of a private industry, whereas in your second hypothetical the favoritism is to the most public of industries, education.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.184" offset="1769073">The second difference is that a tax on out-of-State dairy products increases the cost of out-of-State dairy products to in-State consumers with no detriment to in-State dairy producers, whereas, as our Respondents have pointed out in their brief, when a tax is imposed by a government on a transaction where the government itself is paying the money, which is what we have here, a tax on interest income paid by the government, the effect is to impose a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the government's tax revenues equal to the amount of the exemption.</text>

Taylor for example, does not value free trade above all other values that we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.468" offset="2814180">And we would submit that the value here is the fundamental sovereignty of the States.</text>
