            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="10.353" offset="215613">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Chief Judge Sentelle observed in his dissent below that there are assignments and there are assignments, and that's essentially going to be the theme of my presentation this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.927" offset="269843">It is I think common ground between the parties in this litigation that if you have an assignment which represents the grant of the entirety of both the right and the remedy, that is the complete assignment of the chosen action, then under those circumstances there's no question that the assignee has standing under Article III.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.887" offset="337762">By parity of receiving, if all that the assignee receives is a power of attorney, a mere collection agency role, under those circumstances I think it's common ground between the parties that Article III is not satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.367" offset="391678">Two of the data points come from--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="57.335" stopTime="60.069">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="57.335" offset="403486">Say it again?</text>
            <text syncTime="58.115" offset="406620">What is the common ground?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="60.069" stopTime="118.717">
            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="60.069" offset="414457">--I think the second part of the common ground is that if all that the assignee receives is the power of attorney, that is to serve as the lawyer for the assignor, under those circumstances the assignee doesn't... cannot... has no common stake than I or my clients do in these particular cases, any more than I do in my client's interest in these particular cases, and there I don't think anybody disputes that Article III is not satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.217" offset="495019">Now, the Court in Vermont Agency sort of identified two additional data points.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.244" offset="515185">First of all, it made clear that a 10 percent bounty by itself unattached to anything else is not sufficient, largely I think for the same reasons why the lawyer's claim is insufficient, because that's not tied to the particular right at stake and therefore is inadequate to allow Article III to the satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.048" offset="594388">The second half of it is, though, that if that bounty is coupled with an assignment of the rights and even if that's a partial assignment of the rights, then there is Article III jurisdiction under those circumstances.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="118.717" stopTime="130.119">
            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="118.717" offset="649037">So that if these contracts provided that the aggregators will turn over all of the proceeds of the litigation except for one penny, then you'd be satisfied?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="130.119" stopTime="161.401">
            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="130.119" offset="694699">Well, I'm not sure I'd be satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.789" offset="701386">I think there's a different... I think the answer is that might satisfy Article III.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.225" offset="719045">The only reason I'm reluctant to say that that's the line that ought to be drawn is because this Court's taxpayer standing cases seems to recognize that there are situations where there is a sufficiently de minimis amount of at stake that under those circumstances Article III won't be satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.562" offset="780380">But clearly the cleanest line to draw is in circumstances where have you no stake in the outcome that clearly is beyond what Article III would ultimately do.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="161.401" stopTime="189.141">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="161.401" offset="819773">Well then, this is not really a very significant case, is it?</text>
            <text syncTime="163.541" offset="828341">Because I presume that these enterprises that agglomerate claims and bring suit as a collection agency, they could simply get their compensation, instead of by way of, of a flat fee, by, you know, claiming entitlement to 2 percent of the rewards.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.343" offset="923531">So it's no big deal, I mean, really.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="189.141" stopTime="235.120">
            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="189.141" offset="930741">But it is a big deal, not necessarily because of the importance of the article.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.904" offset="945788">I think the Article III part of it is still a big deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.042" offset="954356">I think requiring as a separation of powers matter that there has to be a concrete stake in the party bringing the litigation, that's an important principle and the Court shouldn't abandon it, and that's posed directly in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.617" offset="1004615">But more fundamentally in terms of the importance of the underlying process, remember here we're talking about an assignee who takes on 1400 different assignor claims involving 400,000 pay phones.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.893" offset="1061771">And that's the problem, is that when you break this down and you allow just simple assignments to satisfy Article III in its prudential standing concerns, then what you end up with is this mass tort litigation.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="235.120" stopTime="288.895">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="235.120" offset="1114643">But it would be just the same, Mr. Phillips, would it not, if the arrangement was that the aggregator gets a piece of the action?</text>
            <text syncTime="244.740" offset="1153095">Let's take out the de minimis one cent.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.336" offset="1167515">A significant stake, like the qui tam plaintiff has.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.721" offset="1189040">So you would have the same problems that you're complaining about with regard to discovery from the individual PSPs, the same problem with respect to counterclaim.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.172" offset="1238882">That's... so it seems to me that, as Justice Scalia suggested, this isn't about a whole lot if just by the device of giving the aggregator part of the, a piece of the action, this suit would be okay because the prudential objections that you are making here would apply just as well.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="288.895" stopTime="312.120">
            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="288.895" offset="1329788">Well, and I would... I would still assert those same prudential objections in the hypothetical you pose.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.362" offset="1351626">What I'm saying is when you... when you have an assignment and there is a bounty built into it, however you want to define the bounty, whether it's a penny or 10 percent or 2 percent or whatever, that may satisfy Article III.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.248" offset="1399169">I understand that.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.418" offset="1403871">That does not answer the question of whether there's prudential standing under those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.574" offset="1420485">In that--</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="313.762" offset="1429262">--In that context, Justice Ginsburg, you do have the problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.760" offset="1441174">You don't get the discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.258" offset="1447234">You don't get to use the efficiency of the counterclaim process, and there are serious questions about whether or not there are res judicata and collateral estoppel effects, and I would argue in that context that there's a very significant claim that those proceedings ought not to be entertained by a Federal court as a prudential matter, not as a matter of Article III.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="336.800" offset="1521422">What if all of the claimants assign their claims to something called an agglomeration trust and the... the person who's bringing suit here brings it as a trustee?</text>
            <text syncTime="351.902" offset="1581817">He has no interest in it personally and he is compensated the same way, the same way this agglomerator is compensated.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.741" offset="1613164">He has no personal interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.866" offset="1621628">He could sue, couldn't he?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="364.568" offset="1632495">I mean, there is a long tradition of allowing trustees to bring litigation on behalf of the trust because that's the only way that a trust can in fact enforce its rights.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="373.907" stopTime="375.300">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="373.907" offset="1669797">So once again, it's no big deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.719" offset="1673037">I mean--</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="375.300" offset="1675335">Well, it is a big deal, because trust relationships carry all kinds of additional legal consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.451" offset="1696024">What is particularly offensive about this arrangement, Your Honors, is that the assignor gets all of the benefits of being able to bring mass tort litigation with none of the responsibilities.</text>

            <text syncTime="396.697" offset="1761017">The trust could do exactly what the aggregator is doing here.</text>

            <text syncTime="401.976" offset="1782124">That's true, but there are additional trust responsibilities that would attach to that process.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.880" offset="1805739">There's an entire legal regime to deal with that.</text>

            <text syncTime="409.705" offset="1813053">--that might protect those who assigned their interest to the trust, but I don't offhand see what difference it would make, what difference those responsibilities would make vis a vis you and your client.</text>

            <text syncTime="421.810" offset="1861432">Well, again, Justice Souter, I think the answer probably is going to depend on how the Court interprets the prudential standing doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.555" offset="1888390">Again, I don't have any quarrel as an Article III matter, because I think it's one of those long-held traditions that trustees are allowed to bring litigation on behalf of the trust and that's understood.</text>

            <text syncTime="452.440" offset="1983894">And your answer was, well, trustees have certain responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.610" offset="1996642">But I don't see that those responsibilities inure to the benefit of your client or to an opposing party in litigation that a trust brings.</text>

            <text syncTime="467.432" offset="2043871">One is that there is this entire legal regime that regulates trusts and that has allowed the courts for 200 years, probably longer than that, to be comfortable to allow litigation to proceed in a particular way.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.771" offset="2085249">But second of all and the second answer to your first question is the prudential concerns remain just, potentially just as serious.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.989" offset="2114088">I think the question is do you want to create litigation devices that allow the courts to avoid... to allow lower courts or, more to the point, allow plaintiffs to avoid the requirements either of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 or the associational standing doctrine.</text>

            <text syncTime="744.334" offset="3151567">--Well, there are two elements of the standing problem: The first one is we're all... let's be clear... we're talking about a hypothetical that's different from this case because we're talking about a hypothetical where in fact the assignee has a concrete interest in the outcome of this dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.828" offset="3201513">Here the assignee has no interest in the outcome of this dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.891" offset="3217709">So the Article III problem arises there.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.421" offset="3227845">The question is if you have a minor amount at interest, even if it's, you know, concrete but nevertheless approaches de minimis, should you nevertheless entertain that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.885" offset="3269745">And I think the answer to your question, Justice Breyer, is that instead of making this into a Federal court case, where you have 1400 claims like this, what the Court should say is that the better course to follow is in fact for the plaintiffs to take their claims, if they want to, in an aggregate form to the FCC because that's the right institution to deal with it because it doesn't have the limitations of Article III and it doesn't have the limitations of prudential standing to interfere with its ability to provide complete relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.871" offset="3381654">And, indeed, if you read the Respondents' brief, they identify, as the prototype litigation, in which this entire system worked effectively, a claim that was in fact litigated in front of the Federal Communications Commission, not a case that was litigated in front of the Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.413" offset="3447796">So, to my mind, the right answer to this case is to take these cases all to the FCC, not as a matter of what we do as primary jurisdiction, but simply as what the plaintiffs do because they don't have the vehicle to bring this to the Federal courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1399.974" offset="5774052">And I don't see how you can get the benefits that you are claiming entitled to without having 1400 separate actions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1422.997" offset="5866212">So it seems to me the prudential question for this Court is: Do we really want to require 1400 separate actions so that you can have your perfect paradigm of private litigation?</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.333" offset="5919502">And to say, yes, we want 1400 actions, it seems to me is a stretch.</text>

            <text syncTime="1442.627" offset="5944684">I think the answer to that is that when you... when you deal with mass tort litigation, the Rules of Civil Procedure ought to apply in that context as it applies in every other place.</text>
