            <text syncTime="10.072" offset="210171">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 1956, the money laundering statute, requires an intent to minimize the criminal taint of unlawful proceeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.096" offset="254265">But the statute does not criminalize concealing money's existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.131" offset="270461">In this case, Mr. Cuellar's conviction should be reversed for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.019" offset="290001">First, while the method of the transportation involved may have been designed to conceal, the transportation itself was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.039" offset="322079">Secondly, while Cuellar may have in fact concealed money itself, he did not conceal the nature, source, location, ownership or control of the unlawful proceeds.</text>

            <text syncTime="49.431" offset="367637">They were secreted in the car, under the goat hair and everything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.651" offset="388535">The location of the money was certainly concealed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jerry V. Beard</label>
            <text syncTime="58.187" offset="402641">Chief Justice, in the broader sense location was concealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.156" offset="418523">The point to be taken here I think is this: An examination of the text itself reveals particular listed attributes, and location numbers among them.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.362" offset="459379">But what this suggests, the requirement that there be a design to conceal or to disguise these particular attributes, necessarily means a plan, if you will, for those... excuse me... for those attributes to be presented either to law enforcement if they intercept the money or inject it into legitimate commerce later.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.812" offset="553106">In other words, they'll be observed later.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.497" offset="559898">Location has independent meaning, but it's also understood within the context of the words that surround it.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.650" offset="584453">All money changes location, whether concealed or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.035" offset="606082">Location in this context means more than the location that the money was found in the car.</text>

            <text syncTime="113.922" offset="625622">Maybe I should ask you this now because you've probably thought about it and I can't work it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.024" offset="642027">I don't see any problem with the word "location".</text>
            <text syncTime="121.362" offset="655297">I thought what you would say is it isn't the transportation in this instance that concealed the location, it's the method of transportation that sealed the location.</text>

            <text syncTime="130.417" offset="691555">And if you read it that literally, then there is no problem in getting to your interpretation of the statute, or is there?</text>
            <text syncTime="137.371" offset="719349">Because since you didn't advance that argument, I thought maybe there's something I've not seen here.</text>

            <text syncTime="144.325" offset="747144">There is a huge difference between the method of transportation and the transportation itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.295" offset="771072">And in this particular case, the difference is certainly implicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.016" offset="789984">What we understand the government to be arguing is that the method of the transportation satisfies the listed attributes.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.205" offset="822690">But if that were the case it would effectively render all transportation of funds necessarily to be money laundering.</text>

            <text syncTime="174.077" offset="866158">I mean, that it was in a car or the fact it was wrapped up in dirty... in a dirty kind of container, and so forth and so on?</text>

            <text syncTime="181.581" offset="896251">Justice Stevens, what I'm referring to is certainly that it was in a car, but there was a secret compartment, goat hair was sprinkled around to try to throw off drug detection dogs, and those type of characteristics.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="194.389" offset="947451">But isn't that all just evidence that there was a motive to conceal the ownership?</text>

            <text syncTime="202.494" offset="979842">What we're looking at here is that the design of the... the fact Mr. Cuellar may or may not have known, for example, who owned... where the money was coming from or who owned it, that doesn't go to the design of the transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.818" offset="1033132">The design of the transportation itself is just to get the money to Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.404" offset="1047552">I can say that abstractly, but in this case in particular because we know from the government's evidence that what this was was essentially the last leg of a drug trafficking deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.643" offset="1084437">We know that this was repayment.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.745" offset="1092900">So in this particular case at least, the purpose of this transportation was to get this money back as repayment money.</text>

            <text syncTime="308.827" offset="1405220">This is why in our reply brief, we gave an example of where the identical type behavior arose, not in Texas but in Alabama, and in fact the individual pleaded guilty to bulk cash smuggling.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.352" offset="1455271">So I suppose my response would be this.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.321" offset="1463212">The same weak inferences that supported the money laundering conviction in the government's eyes would be the same inferences that would support the cash smuggling.</text>

            <text syncTime="1792.249" offset="7338882">But if that's all they were getting at, they wouldn't have to have this international component at all, because if you totally eliminated the "to or through" requirement and you were able to focus or properly focus solely on the method of the transportation, et cetera, then you would cover not only cases in which the concealment ultimately would take place by crossing a border, but you would pick up cases in which the concealment would take place even within the United States; and that would certainly be in the government's interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.506" offset="7479944">But if you add, if you say, well, but this is limited by a to or through requirement, then it suggests, it seems to me, as Justice Breyer's question does, that it must... the statute must be getting at what happens when it crosses the border as opposed to the means of crossing.</text>

            <text syncTime="3403.243" offset="13782873">I think it is important for the Court to recall that the very broad interpretations that the government advances today are essentially the very broad interpretations that the Congress rejected explicitly 20 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.817" offset="13833132">The Congress rejected the notion that the transportation of illicit funds in and of itself created money laundering liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="3425.540" offset="13872002">I think it's important, Justice Scalia, in particular, in response to your question to bring this up, because the Congress recognized that detection would be harder in rejecting that type of legislation, but rejected that they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.951" offset="13937726">The Congress has also shown itself capable of... of... in the 1957 context of taking transactions involving unlawful proceeds and making those per se illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.626" offset="13992375">They could have easily done the same thing in the transportation context if they had wanted to, but instead they were looking at the separate behavior that comprises money laundering.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.498" offset="14027901">I mean, it is the notion that you're taking money somewhere else and you're doing something else and it gives rise to separate liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.301" offset="14051098">I think the true harm in the government's interpretation, it basically conflates liability for money laundering with the underlying offense, because all of the underlying offenses involve concealment.</text>
