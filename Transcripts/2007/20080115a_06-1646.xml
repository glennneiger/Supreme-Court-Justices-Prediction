            <text syncTime="8.013" offset="202065">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Armed Career Criminal Act is one of the Federal Government's most important tools for incapacitating serial offenders who commit serious crimes, and, like other Federal recidivism statutes, the ACCA defines the prior offenses that trigger its application based partly upon the maximum terms of imprisonment for those offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.191" offset="294852">The question presented in this case is whether the relevant maximum term of imprisonment for an offender who was already a repeat offender is the maximum to which repeat offenders were subject to that offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.811" offset="349291">Alone among the circuits, the Ninth Circuit held that the relevant maximum for a repeat offender is instead the maximum to which first-time offenders were subject, even though that purported maximum would sometimes be lower than the term that a repeated offender would actually receive.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.914" offset="413657">Because the ACCA cannot support that counterintuitive and counterfactual approach, the judgment of the Ninth Circuit should be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="81.280" offset="495159">Now the government says there are alternative maximums and you have to pick whichever maximum is the higher.</text>

            <text syncTime="94.057" offset="546254">That is because, Justice Scalia, we believe that the text of the ACCA naturally accommodates the possibility that there may be alternative maximum terms of imprisonment for a given offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.004" offset="590035">The provision the ACCA at issue, Section 924(e)(2)(A)(ii), defines a serious drug offense as</text>
            <text syncTime="112.720" offset="620964">"a State drug trafficking offense for which a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years or more is prescribed by law. "</text>
            <text syncTime="119.780" offset="649177">and we believe that that language is susceptible to the interpretation that the maximum for a repeat offender is the maximum to which repeat offenders were subject and the maximum for a first-time offender is the maximum to which first-time offenders were subject.</text>

            <text syncTime="162.809" offset="821271">But a higher sentence for repeat offenders is no less a maximum for the offense than the lower sentence for first-time offenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.166" offset="854708">This Court's cases involving challenges to recidivism statutes make that clear because they have uniformly held that a recidivism enhancement constitutes a stiffened penalty for an underlying offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="297.646" offset="1360648">I believe it's 18 U.S.C. 5037(c)(1)(b), which provided at the time that the court was construing it that the maximum... that the sentence that a juvenile should receive should be no higher than the maximum that an adult offender should receive.</text>

            <text syncTime="354.967" offset="1589898">It focused on categories of offenders and there Congress's concern was obviously with career offenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.339" offset="1615394">But I think critically in the LaBonte opinion itself, written by Justice Thomas for the Court, the Court recognized the possibility that a statute could establish alternative maximum terms of imprisonment for recidivist and nonrecidivist offenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.896" offset="1677670">The Court specifically discussed the Controlled Substances Act, which does exactly that.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.769" offset="1697105">Now, to be sure the language of that statute was somewhat different, but in our view the critical lesson of LaBonte is simply that it is possible for a statute to establish alternative maximums and the statute at issue here no less than the statute at issue in LaBonte accommodates that possibility.</text>

            <text syncTime="411.615" offset="1816537">--If a State, Justice Scalia were to essentially define a new crime of drug trafficking by a recidivist, then to be sure by definition the maximum sentence for that offense would be the maximum to which repeat offenders were subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.860" offset="1869513">But to say one more thing in response to the Chief Justice's question about guidelines maximums, I do think that it is critical to remember that Congress enacted the ACCA in its present form in 1986, well before this Court's Apprendi jurisprudence took root, and at that time Congress surely would have conceived of the relevant maximum as the offense-specific statutory maximum, and we know that Congress viewed that maximum as a discrete creature from the relevant guidelines maximum because in passing the Sentencing Reform Act 2 years earlier, the statute that gave rise to the Federal guidelines, Congress smoke specifically about statutory maximums as distinct from guidelines maximums.</text>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="472.122" offset="2058535">In light of Apprendi and the later cases, do you think it's feasible any longer to draw a distinction between, between statutes that make recidivism an element of the offense and statutes that originally conceived of recidivism as a sentencing factor but now provide for that to be proven to a jury?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Kannon K. Shanmugam</label>
            <text syncTime="491.708" offset="2136902">--One of the virtues of our approach, Justice Alito, is that the answer is in some sense the same whether a legislature defines drug trafficking by a recidivist as a distinct offense or whether recidivism is simply a sentencing factor that gives rise to an alternative maximum term of imprisonment for the underlying offense of drug trafficking.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.683" offset="2228749">And our fundamental submission with regard to the Court's Apprendi line of cases is simply that it alters nothing with regard to how the ACCA should be interpreted because, again, Congress was defining 1986 in its colloquial sense as essentially what the legislature defines the offense to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.535" offset="2312132">And to be sure, it is a prerequisite for a fact to be an offense element that it be submitted to the jury, but all this court did in Apprendi line of cases was effectively to state a procedural constitutional rule under which a sentencing factor that raises the applicable maximum sentence has to be submitted to the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="582.408" offset="2499691">In some State systems, of course, the guidelines are themselves statutory and for that reason we refer to them in our brief as offense-specific maximums.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.873" offset="2537516">But the critical point with regard to the Sentencing Reform Act is that Congress did believe that there was such a thing as the maximum for the offense, and indeed in Section 994(r) of Title 28, one of the provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act, Congress actually asked the Sentencing Commission to come back with recommendations to alter those offense-specific maximums, which we believe is certainly evidence that Congress viewed that as something distinct.</text>

            <text syncTime="994.912" offset="4149689">Most States' drug-trafficking recidivism provisions, as least those States that have adopted the Uniform Controlled Substances Act provision, operate in a quite straightforward manner because they essentially sweep in all prior drug offenses.</text>

            <text syncTime="2170.523" offset="8852148">First of all, I question how seriously anyone took that statement in the sentencing declaration, because what really mattered in Washington State was the binding determinant sentencing guideline, which set a maximum term of 57 months, which everyone agrees was the highest penalty this defendant could receive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.970" offset="8917872">In fact, it's quite clear that, absent aggravating circumstances, which are not present in this case, no one convicted of this defendant's crime could receive a punishment, recidivist or not, of 10 years, enough to trigger the ACCA predicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.213" offset="8982865">So, I question again whether or not anyone took that terribly seriously.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.212" offset="8994881">But I think even if one did, it doesn't answer the question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.648" offset="9004599">There is no question that there was a recidivism provision which, at least in some theoretical sense, made the maximum penalty 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.926" offset="9037722">There is also a statutory provision which defined the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.315" offset="9055276">And in that... in that statutory provision the Washington legislature specifically associated with conviction of that offense a five-year maximum penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.592" offset="9092370">And I think it sort of... it sort of begs the question to say, as the government does, well, the fact that there is some possibility out there of an enhancement that increases the penalty above 10 years, even if that were true, which is not, again because of the sentencing guidelines in this case, that sort of begs the question of what is the relevant offense?</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.445" offset="9155795">Is the relevant offense what you might call the generic categorical offense of distribution of Schedule 3, 4, or 5 drugs, the sentence to which anyone convicted of that crime, anyone who engaged in the elements of that offense and is found guilty in Washington State could have been sentenced to, and that is 5 years.</text>

            <text syncTime="3260.055" offset="13210209">And the government does not offer any explanation that I can understand as to why, if their test applies, one takes recidivism enhancements into effect, but does not take guidelines reductions into effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="3273.938" offset="13265797">What I am finding hard is once you distinguish offender and offense characteristics in the way you do, why not jump to the max for the offense?</text>

            <text syncTime="3295.072" offset="13350329">Well, the way... the way we resolve that, Justice Breyer, is what was suggested by Justice Souter's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.335" offset="13375407">What Congress had in mind was the offense without the overlay of a recidivism enhancement, which is not an element of this offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.471" offset="13403933">One looks at the offense, one looks at the commission of the elements, if you commit the elements, what does that subject... what kind of punishment does that subject you to?</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.593" offset="13440400">If it's less than 10 years, ACCA does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.452" offset="13447818">If you have to call into the mix enhancements that are unrelated, that are offender-specific and not offense-specific, that's falls out because that's not what Congress had in mind when it referred to</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.839" offset="13493376">"punishment prescribed by law for the offense. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.135" offset="13502571">Again, Congress had in mind a limited series of serious offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.306" offset="13519289">It was looking at what people did, whether they engaged in the kind of serious, harmful, destructive conduct that was sufficiently bad to trigger the mandatory 15-year sentence, and if they did not, the fact that some additional overlay could be used to enhance their sentence is not what Congress was concerned about when it listed ACCA predicates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.671" offset="13604762">And, again, I don't want to fall away from the Sentencing Guidelines point because, as I understood Mr. Shanmugam's explanation to Justice Scalia as to why the Guidelines should not apply if enhancement does is because, well, this is an offender-specific... an offense-specific crime, and Congress at the time that it enacted ACCA had in mind that guidelines in the statutory regime were different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.941" offset="13713849">But so far as the... the offense has been defined by the... by the statute, the relevant offense here is the five-year penalty associated with that offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.765" offset="13757108">And so I think that if one is going to go beyond that and say we are going to look for things that are outside of the offense, not in the elements of the offense, to increase the sentence, as the government does with the recidivism statute, there is no reason why, if we are prepared to go outside of the offense elements, that one wouldn't go to the Guidelines as well, which have precisely the same effect in the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.332" offset="13851358">I mean the government ultimately is asking for... a one-way ratchet that if it increases the offense level, that's okay, but if it decreases the punishment for some reason, that doesn't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.110" offset="13890437">And we just don't see any principled basis for that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3459.396" offset="14007675">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.880" offset="14013526">There are just two points that I'd like to make in rebuttal: The first is that the government believes that the rule of lenity is inapplicable here for the simple reason that we believe that the text of the statute is not susceptible to Respondent's interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.968" offset="14069951">And if the Court concludes that the statute does permit the interpretation that a given offense can have only a single maximum term of imprisonment, we believe that the only logical conclusion is that that maximum is the maximum that any offender could receive, not that the maximum... not that it is the maximum that some better-positioned subset of offenders could receive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.647" offset="14152602">And while we do believe that the considerations that underlie the rule of lenity have less force in this context, and the Court has never applied the rule of lenity to the ACCA, we ultimately believe that the fact that the text does not permit Respondent's interpretation is the end of the inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.436" offset="14215818">The other point that I would just make is that if this Court were to adopt Respondent's interpretation, it would have pernicious consequences, not only for the ACCA, but likely also for a number of other critically important Federal statutes as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.666" offset="14268690">With regard to the ACCA itself, both the definition of 28 States and the Federal Government have drug-trafficking offenses that would qualify as ACCA predicates for repeat offenders under the government's interpretation but not under Respondent's.</text>

            <text syncTime="3577.661" offset="14480700">But with regard to other statutes, I want to note that similar language also appears in the Federal three-strikes law and in the Controlled Substances Act, which along with the ACCA, are among the most important Federal statutes dealing with a problem of recidivism.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.092" offset="14538378">And similar language also appears in a number of general Federal criminal statutes, including RICO and the very substantive statute at issue here, the felony possession statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.883" offset="14581533">And if this Court were to adopt the Ninth Circuit's interpretation, it could potentially lead to the narrowing of all of those statutes as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.054" offset="14614238">The Ninth Circuit, alone among the circuits, has adopted this view that the relevant maximum for an offense must be the maximum that first-time offenders receive.</text>
