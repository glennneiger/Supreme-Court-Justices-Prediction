            <text syncTime="8.887" offset="201164">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question in this case is whether Section 360k(a) of the Medical Device Amendment to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act preempts State law claims seeking damages for injuries caused by a device that received pre-market approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.412" offset="263230">Medtronic's view of the pre-market approval process is that it results in an FDA decision that a particular device must be designed, labeled, and manufactured in a particular way.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.253" offset="306594">This view is incorrect, and so I want to talk... begin by talking about what pre-market approval is and what it isn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.639" offset="336164">PMA is FDA's permission to market a Class 3 device.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.013" offset="353614">The manufacturer PMA device develops the design and chooses the... choosing it on its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.963" offset="385484">After the company submits the application, the FDA evaluates it, based on information submitted, but it does no independent testing, no product development, no comparison with other products to see if this one is as good as or better than existing products... or even if it's the best that it can be.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.361" offset="459044">If the information submitted by the company meets the statutory standard, reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, the FDA grants PMA, thus permitting the device to be sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.981" offset="509513">So the FDA approves the design and labeling chosen by the manufacturer, but the agency doesn't require the manufacturer to choose... to make those choices.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.946" offset="545353">Once on the market, a PMA device may prove to be unsafe, because very often problems and hazards come to light only after the device is in widespread use.</text>

            <text syncTime="108.456" offset="599374">Isn't that situation addressed by the requirement that the manufacturer alert the FDA to new information and at least file annual reports, and then the FDA can pull back the pre-market approval if they think these problems require it to do so?</text>

            <text syncTime="126.309" offset="670845">The requirement about submitting adverse event reports and the annual report are intended help the FDA to monitor the device after it's on the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.039" offset="717761">But the responsibility and the opportunity to improve the design or labeling or to initiate a recall is really on the manufacturer in the first instance, because the manufacturer is the first one to learn about the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.531" offset="779724">The FDA has a more passive role.</text>

            <text syncTime="540.067" offset="2325859">Right.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.395" offset="2327217">But I think in trying to figure out what the express preemption provision means, it's actually useful to consider why there's none for drugs and there is one for devices.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.531" offset="2363684">And the reason is because drugs were regulated by the FDA since 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.373" offset="2387090">Devices weren't regulated until 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.450" offset="2399420">So, in those intervening 38 years, States had stepped in and started to do some regulation on their own to fill that regulatory void.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.572" offset="2439857">California is the most notable example, and the one discussed the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.397" offset="2455217">So, when drafting the medical device amendments and coming up with the system for pre-market scrutiny, the question arose, well, what about California?</text>
            <text syncTime="581.925" offset="2493252">What about other States that are regulating good manufacturing practices?</text>
            <text syncTime="586.267" offset="2510701">Or California had a PMA scheme of its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.844" offset="2520941">And so the legislative history makes clear that Congress, faced with this dilemma, decided California shouldn't be able to continue to regulate devices in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.558" offset="2571828">It shouldn't be able to pre-screen devices once the FDA had stepped in and filled the Federal void.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.103" offset="2593980">And that's why you didn't need an express preemption provision for drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.819" offset="2612893">The States weren't doing that in 1938, but because the government... the Federal government waited so long to regulate devices, it was necessary to say what are we going to do about these State regulations?</text>

            <text syncTime="3234.031" offset="13101683">And also I think the FDA regulations promulgated when this was put out, soon after the '76 amendments were passed, I think reinforced the conclusion that... and, in fact, there was a regulation that specifically talks about the application of general adulteration standards in a way that might require a specific label change to be made by a manufacturer, and we think that's basically precisely this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.863" offset="13213069">It's the application of general tort law that would require the manufacturer or a standard of care under common law that would say that what the manufacturer had done specifically approved by FDA was... was improper as a matter of State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.999" offset="13273568">We think that that is in the teeth of the preemption provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.028" offset="13285689">I think Justice Alito asked the question about the issue of whether FDA focused or didn't focus on a particular aspect of the design.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.930" offset="13321320">We don't think that a preemption test can really realistically turn on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.992" offset="13337516">That would require extensive and intrusive inquiry into what FDA had done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.021" offset="13357683">We think that the best way to look at this is what the end product was; what was the application that was finally approved and the labeling associated with it, much like the filed rate doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.612" offset="13392060">You look at what was put before the agency and what was approved, not what might have gone into... into consideration.</text>
