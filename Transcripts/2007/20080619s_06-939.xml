            <text syncTime="9.242" offset="141680">The petitioners in this case are several organizations whose members do business with the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.773" offset="171877">They sued to enjoin enforcement of a California statute which among other things prohibits employers that receive state grants and state program funds from using the funds to assist, promote or deter union organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.679" offset="235407">The statute also imposes substantial compliance burdens and litigation risks on any employer that seeks to use its own funds to engage in such speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.799" offset="279920">The District Court granted petitioner's partial summary judgment holding that the National Labor Relations Act preempts the grant and program fund restrictions because they regulate the employer's speech about union organizing in circumstances in which Congress intended there to be free debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.707" offset="359541">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, concluding that Congress did not intend to preclude States from imposing such restrictions in the use of their own funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.462" offset="402591">We granted certiorari and now reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.451" offset="414503">For the reasons stated in opinion filed with the clerk, we agree with the District Court that contrary to congressional intent, the challenged provisions of the California statute regulate non-coercive employer speech about union organizing.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.819" offset="480018">Justice Breyer has filed a dissenting opinion that Justice Ginsburg has joined.</text>
