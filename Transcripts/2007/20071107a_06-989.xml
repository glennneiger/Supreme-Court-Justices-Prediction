            <text syncTime="8.244" offset="212409">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In this case two very sophisticated parties agreed to arbitrate an ongoing dispute that was pending in litigation before the United States District Court for the District of Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.462" offset="261311">Their agreement states plainly that after an arbitration award is issued the district court... and this is at Pet. App. 16A...</text>
            <text syncTime="28.409" offset="293075">"shall vacate, modify, or correct any award where the arbitrator's conclusions of law are erroneous. "</text>
            <text syncTime="34.471" offset="317317">Ultimately what this Court must decide is whether there is anything in either the Federal Arbitration Act or any other Federal law that renders this non-adhesive, unambiguous contract agreement unenforceable.</text>

            <text syncTime="47.581" offset="369771">Mr. Phillips, would you say the same thing if the agreement provided for de novo review in the district court?</text>

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="56.920" offset="407074">I would be more concerned about identifying a standard of review for the district court than identifying a standard for modifying the arbitration award pursuant to the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.393" offset="460991">So I think that's a different issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.679" offset="466111">I think that's closer to dealing with a judicial function than this is, which is simply implementing the intent of the parties as to what the standard ought to be for enforcing an initial award.</text>

            <text syncTime="82.218" offset="508324">That would be... I am assuming that the parties wrote that standard into their contract, so to the extent you're relying on party autonomy why couldn't the parties elect whatever standard of review they wish?</text>

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="98.497" offset="573422">Justice Ginsburg, I recognize that there is a limit to party autonomy.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.531" offset="585542">I think there ought to be a very strong preference for party autonomy, and I'm not saying that if I were here and I had an agreement by which de novo review is the standard I wouldn't defend that autonomy.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.654" offset="626084">All I'm saying is that I recognize that there are limitations on autonomy that recognize the functions of the Judiciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.391" offset="653043">But that limitation isn't remotely implicated in this particular case.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="123.545" offset="673627">Well, in some... one of the functions of a judicial... what about an agreement, arbitration agreement, that the district court can find facts de novo?</text>

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="130.598" offset="701839">That one I think worries me less because it doesn't... it doesn't suggest... I mean it just says that we will leave to the district, to the district court the findings, and essentially renders the arbitration agreement--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="146.393" stopTime="156.932">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="146.393" offset="765056">Well, suppose it's a complex matter of monitoring emissions, looking at water quality, and the arbitrator has to sit by the river for a month, the district judge had to go down and sit by the river for a month.</text>

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="156.932" offset="807165">--But again, the parties under those circumstances it seems to me are perfectly free to decide whether they want those issues to be decided conclusively by the arbitrator or to have them adjudicated at the end of the day by the Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.888" offset="846976">And so, if they choose to go through the arbitral process, and then still say nevertheless that's nonbinding and that the district court's free to evaluate that on a de novo record, that it seems to me doesn't in fact implicate the judicial function in quite the same way that the standard of review does.</text>

            <text syncTime="193.371" offset="952928">And in that context you're not raising the same problem that you're referring to, Justice Ginsburg, because you're not saying anything about the standard of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.692" offset="982186">You're just simply saying that the court ought to decide the legal issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.727" offset="994306">Now, I do think that when the parties agree that it's a question of law that the question of law is for the district court to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.881" offset="1022937">My assumption is that the district court in fact will use de novo review, but the parties are not dictating that.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.135" offset="1048014">That's a matter that's left... I'm sorry.</text>

            <text syncTime="226.491" offset="1085422">They do, but that issue... that standard of review is not at issue in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.810" offset="1102662">The only question here is whether or not there has been an error of law committed, and obviously the district court found that there was a clear error of law committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.797" offset="1130666">Indeed, the dissenting judge below said it was an irrational decision on the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="255.858" offset="1202868">So are you saying that you... we don't have to deal with that question or you're not going to defend it, because the standard was dual.</text>

            <text syncTime="271.868" offset="1266920">There are, there are clearly two different standards that are set out in the arbitration agreement and one of them is substantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.670" offset="1290117">But when the matter went from the arbitrator to the district court there was no issue presented by Hall Street on the question of substantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.592" offset="1321777">We didn't challenge any of the factual findings by the... by the arbitrator, and therefore that issue is not presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.080" offset="1339750">I'm not saying I wouldn't defend it.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.363" offset="1344870">All I'm saying is I don't have to defend it in this particular case because the only issue here is whether there has been an error of law.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="296.983" offset="1367335">But you have to give us a standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.768" offset="1374545">You said, you mentioned, oh, functions of the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.387" offset="1384994">I don't know the standard you're proposing that will allow us to draw the line and to put cases on one side of the line or the other.</text>

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="313.043" offset="1431596">Well, the problem there... and again, I think this is largely a fanciful concern because I don't think serious parties who are engaged in arbitration agreements are likely to come up with standards that are completely alien to the judicial process, and indeed there's no empirical evidence to support that.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.753" offset="1490424">Certainly Respondent didn't cite anything and our amici didn't cite anything like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.073" offset="1503694">But to be sure, Judge Kozinski in his concurring opinion in the original panel decision in Kyocera said he would have a very different reaction to this case if we were talking about the district court either flipping a coin or looking at the entrails of dead birds as the basis for decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.749" offset="1566388">And our basic point is we're not embracing that extreme approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.736" offset="1586346">I mean, we recognize party autonomy as a significant part of what Section 2 of the Arbitration Act is all about and we think that ought to drive the analysis of this Court significantly, particularly in how you interpret Section 9.</text>

            <text syncTime="615.887" offset="2642946">And you couple that with the fact that Justice Story, back as early as 1814, said that as a matter of common law that the notion of restricted arbitration is a matter completely left to the parties.</text>

            <text syncTime="1116.907" offset="4647061">The first one is: What does the plain meaning of the statute say?</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.207" offset="4656256">The plain meaning of the statute, which is at 1a of the appendix to the petition, is the parties in their agreement agreed that a judgment of the court shall be entered upon the award.</text>

            <text syncTime="1141.553" offset="4745699">Because under Section 2 the parties have... have provided a mechanism for that by saying that the district court will correct an award if it's erroneous as a matter of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1599.258" offset="6576465">And the court said there: Well, we all know that the Securities Act generally would apply to arbitration.</text>

            <text syncTime="2425.083" offset="9879805">There was an opportunity to have judicial review of the law through a contract enforcement case, although there was a clear statement requirement.</text>

            <text syncTime="3508.643" offset="14214042">But the point is if, if all you do is agree to an arbitration, then Section 9 and Section 10 apply directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.947" offset="14243195">But if you agree to an arbitration that is subject to legal error or review, okay, then the "if" clause doesn't prevent you from being allowed to have that portion enforced, Your Honor.</text>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3529.373" offset="14296902">Well, if you agree on condition and the conditions are satisfied, are you saying that the district court must enforce under Section 9, or are you saying that enforcement would be under some other authority?</text>

            <text syncTime="3539.829" offset="14338803">I think the enforcement would be under the existing authority that the district court had in this particular case, because this was a case that was pending before the district court under diversity jurisdiction seeking to enforce the lease agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.970" offset="14387286">And we have a final decision from the arbitrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.322" offset="14396690">The judge has now made a decision that that is wrong as a matter of law and has enforced the lease in a particular way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.976" offset="14419364">And so the question is, is that judgment of the district court subject to challenge?</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.963" offset="14439322">And our answer to that is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.331" offset="14448726">There is nothing in the Federal Arbitration Act that prevents the district judge from doing precisely what it did.</text>

            <text syncTime="3598.718" offset="14574323">Well, all I'm saying is that we can win on either theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.553" offset="14581637">My whole point here has been Section 9 doesn't prevent us from being able to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.688" offset="14598146">Section 10 is not an exhaustive list and, therefore, we are allowed to add to Section 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.575" offset="14613715">And at the end of the day, regardless, you ought to interpret this under Section 2, consistent with the intent of the parties to ensure that we get what we want.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.896" offset="14643077">The one point I did want to make about how all of this operates is, you know, in the relationship between the courts and arbitrators, it seems to there is probably no more important issue than who decides whether something is arbitratable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.637" offset="14686022">And yet, this Court held quite clearly in First Options that even though the statute says it's the arbitrator... I mean, that it's the court, it can be made the arbitrator by the parties.</text>
