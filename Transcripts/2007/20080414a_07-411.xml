            <text syncTime="1265.891" offset="5223178">If you look at the general verdict form at page 192... 191 and 192 in the joint appendix, you'll see that the jury... the tribal court jury was asked interrogatories about liability: Liability for contract, liability for discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.699" offset="5286499">When they got to question 6 on page 192, the question was asked of the jury if you answered "yes" to question four for the other liability questions, four being the discrimination claim, then award damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.006" offset="5343655">And so the jury awarded $750,000 of undifferentiated damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.829" offset="5366956">Whether it was for contract, whether it was for tort is not for us to now second-guess.</text>

            <text syncTime="1308.672" offset="5394332">And the jury was instructed that they could award damages for breach... for discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.355" offset="5425052">So, you know, that is a feature of how the case was tried.</text>

            <text syncTime="1325.901" offset="5463296">And at this point it's impossible to know... the $750,000 that was ultimately awarded was far less than what the Longs were asking for for breach of contract, and they didn't say they were not asking for damages for discrimination in the tribal... in the tribal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.268" offset="5524736">So for this Court to say now that there was no jurisdiction over the discrimination claim would basically invalidate that underlying judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1366.272" offset="5624732">You have emphasized consistently through your argument the need for consent whether we call it actual, explicit, some kind of consent to at least the regulatory jurisdiction upon which a judicial jurisdiction is premised.</text>

            <text syncTime="1399.776" offset="5758793">As I recall what the court said in Montana it was that there may be situations in which a nonmember enters into a consensual relationship with the tribe or tribal members, and as a result of that consensual relationship, it then would be appropriate to recognize jurisdiction, for example, to tax regulatory jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.840" offset="5883031">My understanding is that the consent that Montana was talking about was not a consent to the specific jurisdiction whether it be regulatory or adjudicatory, but rather consent to some kind of, or a consent forming some kind of a relationship that would make it appropriate for the tribe to assert regulatory jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.108" offset="5984073">So that the consent does not have to relate to jurisdiction as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.186" offset="6004448">Am I... if that is correct, then your argument for consent seems to me to miss the point.</text>

            <text syncTime="1684.328" offset="6897000">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to address both standing and the merits, but because there are some additional wrinkles on the standing question in light of how it was briefed in the reply brief, I'd like to make three brief points on the merits before addressing standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.994" offset="6963665">First, the bank engaged in a seven-year business relationship with the Longs, knowing that they were Indians and deriving substantial commercial benefits from the Longs' tribal status through the BIA loan guarantees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.863" offset="7023119">Second, the bank has not challenged tribal court jurisdiction over the breach of contract claim or the bad faith claim, which are the core claims in the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1731.574" offset="7085918">And I'll address that, Justice Ginsburg, on the general verdict point, which is there is actually some law of this which I would like to describe for the Court my understanding of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.523" offset="7121758">My third point, though, is that both the district court and the Eighth Circuit below found significant that the bank had conceded tribal court jurisdiction in its motion for summary judgment on its counterclaim, and they found that concession to be important to note, and both courts below found the Indian character of the Long family company to be notable as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.139" offset="7216216">Under this Court's two court rule, those fact findings are entitled to significant respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.777" offset="7238786">Now, as to the standing question Justice Ginsburg, let me get to your point on the general verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.839" offset="7259057">This is ultimately a question of tribal procedural law, how the tribal court would treat vacature of a claim deemed to be an invalid claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="1856.085" offset="7584020">In the trial transcript which is contained at roughly pages 555 through 562 of the tribal court record, there was colloquy on how these special interrogatories were to be framed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.457" offset="7637519">The bank objected to number 4, the discrimination count on the ground that a company cannot be discriminated against, only individuals can be discriminated against.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.812" offset="7682868">That objection was sustained, and so special interrogatory 4 was written as you see it in the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.483" offset="7705542">The bank did not object to the general verdict question on damages, so the law on Rule 49(a)(3) would be that special verdict is deemed to be waived, and now there is some--</text>

            <text syncTime="2833.419" offset="11493297">The way the South Dakota statute is worded, Mr. Chief Justice, unfortunately, I can't give you a direct answer to that because it involves a panoply of issues whether State law deems the final judgment ultimately to be a fair one and... and, importantly, when this Court recognized the jurisdictional point as giving rise to Federal jurisdiction in National Farmers, I would submit it also perhaps created the avenue for the enforcement of judgments to be brought in Federal court as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.501" offset="11617640">I don't understand why a jurisdictional challenge and a challenge to the enforcement of a judgment could not give rise to the same Federal question jurisdiction recognized in National Farmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.215" offset="11656510">So I think there are two avenues to be in State or Federal court when enforcing a judgment in tribal court that heretofore for have not fully been explored, certainly not by any decisions of this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3535.913" offset="14303341">I think when you step back in listening to the arguments of opposing counsel, you know, what is the other way that tribal courts get... that the tribes get jurisdiction over nonmembers?</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.016" offset="14363736">Well, Congress can provide it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.172" offset="14372305">And if we look at this Bureau of Indian Affairs loan guaranty program, which Congress authorized, Congress didn't provide jurisdiction over nonmembers in implementation of that program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.433" offset="14421415">So you've got an elaborate loan program and it's designed to provide capital to tribes and tribal members, and Congress is silent on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.960" offset="14455478">Now, in other instances Congress has provided authorization for tribal courts and tribes to have jurisdiction over nonmembers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.584" offset="14485989">Congress is aware of this Court's opinion in Montana presumably and the cases that follow from it, but in the Bureau of Indian Affairs loan guaranty program Congress remained silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.454" offset="14533428">What do we infer from that?</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.857" offset="14543041">I think it is crucial when you think about nonmember defendants in tribal court and whether they can have their rights adjudicated there to think about the structural problems, the lack of a right to remove, the lack of a right to have this Court provide a substantive review.</text>
