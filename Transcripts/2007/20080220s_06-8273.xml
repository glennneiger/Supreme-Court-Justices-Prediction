            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104701">In the other case I have, Danforth against Minnesota, the case comes to us from the State Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.749" offset="143676">The petitioner is challenging the constitutionality of his 1996 conviction of criminal sexual conduct with a minor.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.784" offset="179829">He contends that allowing the jury to hear a videotape interview with his victim violated the constitutional rule that we later announced in Crawford against Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.849" offset="224028">Generally speaking, new rules of constitutional procedure must be applied in cases that are not yet final when the new rule is announced.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.561" offset="262899">Then under our decision in the case called Teague against Lane, a new rule will not be applied by a federal court in a habeas corpus proceeding that is filed after the state conviction has become final.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.317" offset="321935">The question in this case is whether the Minnesota Supreme Court correctly held that Teague limits the authority of state courts to give broader effect to the rule we announced in Crawford and Teague requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.121" offset="381181">We have never suggested that it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.966" offset="392466">And for the reasons stated in our opinion filed with the Clerk, we hold that it does not, neither Teague nor any of our other cases explicitly or implicitly constrains the authority of the States to provide remedies for a broader range of constitutional violations, then federal courts must remedy by issuing the writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.731" offset="479610">Accordingly, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Minnesota is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.713" offset="519525">The Chief Justice joined by Justice Kennedy has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
