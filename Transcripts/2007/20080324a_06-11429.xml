            <text syncTime="29.909" offset="266832">A reaffirmation of that time-honored principle is all that is necessary to decide this case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="43.874" offset="322734">--As to sentencing?</text>
            <text syncTime="44.295" offset="324406">No, in the mid-20th century, Justice Kennedy, in the Bell decision written by Justice Frankfurter and in Ladner, both involved the degree of punishment which the defendant would receive.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.182" offset="367978">There are other cases: In 1980 the Simpson case, and Bifulco around the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.008" offset="395250">So this Court has a history of applying the rule of lenity with equal force to sentencing provisions as it does to statutes demarcating criminal conduct or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.019" offset="439345">And of course, as the green brief specially highlights, the very essence and the core of the rule of lenity derives from the English common law, which is... which was designed to invoke the rule of lenity to avoid mandatory punishment, not... not so much whether conduct was criminal or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.419" offset="508935">So we think that applying that rule in a straightforward manner to this case requires a reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.884" offset="534744">The 20-year mandatory minimum in Section 841(b)(1)(A) applies only to defendants who have a prior conviction for a, quote, "felony drug offense".</text>
            <text syncTime="106.318" offset="572465">Now, a sensible reading of that provision is that a State law misdemeanor simply does not constitute a felony drug offense.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="113.519" stopTime="127.449">
            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="113.519" offset="601304">Well, but if the rule of lenity depends upon of course some ambiguity in the term, the definition says</text>
            <text syncTime="118.703" offset="622098">"1 year. "</text>
            <text syncTime="123.717" offset="642160">It doesn't say anything about State classification.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jeffrey_l_fisher" startTime="127.449" stopTime="170.106">
            <label>Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="127.449" offset="656997">That's right, Mr. Chief Justice, and if that's all you had on the statute books this might be an easier case.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.948" offset="675074">But as you know, I think, above section 44 and section 13 the term "felony" is described and defined as</text>
            <text syncTime="139.118" offset="703704">"a crime that is classified as a felony under Federal or State law. "</text>
            <text syncTime="143.912" offset="722930">And so when you start with section 841(b)(1)(A), which uses the term "felony drug offense", and you go to the definitional section, the first thing you come to is the definition of felony, which says a crime classified as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.485" offset="773190">And then, as you say, in section 44 you reach another definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.702" offset="794088">So we think that at the very least you have an ambiguity here in which Congress has given two facially applicable definitions to the operative provision of the statute.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="170.106" stopTime="179.026">
            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="170.106" offset="827629">Well, obviously one is a definition of "felony" and the other is the definition of "felony drug offense" and the term that's at issue here is "felony drug offense".</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jeffrey_l_fisher" startTime="179.026" stopTime="222.305">
            <label>Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="179.026" offset="863365">Well, in a sense it's our position that both are at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.898" offset="878829">The term "felony", which is within the term "felony drug offense", is also at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.866" offset="894712">And as we've pointed out in pages 11 and 12, 11 and 12 of our yellow brief, it's not uncommon for Congress to have two separate definitions one of which is a single term within a broader term in a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.017" offset="943299">And so the mere fact, as the government would argue, that the word 44 does not mean that Congress meant that to be the sole definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.341" offset="988648">We've given three examples on pages 11 and 12 where the sensible reading of the statute is that Congress attempted to nest the definition of a single term within the definition of a broader term.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="222.305" stopTime="303.616">
            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="222.305" offset="1036504">Could I... could I ask you what you think Congress might have been trying to do with the 1994 amendment under... under your reading?</text>
            <text syncTime="233.158" offset="1079867">Before 1994 the offense had to be classified as a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.595" offset="1093660">Then they added this definition of "felony drug offense", and as I understand it your reading is that now the offense must be classified as a felony and it must be punishable by more, by imprisonment for more than a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.449" offset="1149040">What would be the reason for adding this new requirement as you see it, that it be punishable by more than a year, if there were not offenses that were classified by States as felonies but were punishable by less than a year?</text>
            <text syncTime="266.819" offset="1214555">I can't see the point unless the point was to rule those out.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.692" offset="1230019">And you haven't cited any State statute in your brief that involved an offense that was classified as a felony and is punishable by less than a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.826" offset="1282578">You cited a couple that were punishable by exactly a year, not more than a year but exactly a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.590" offset="1309640">So is it your, your theory that the reason for adding this new language was to make it clear that those offenses where the maximum was 12 months, as opposed to 12 months and a day, would not be counted?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jeffrey_l_fisher" startTime="303.616" stopTime="328.652">
            <label>Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="303.616" offset="1361676">I think there is an agreement between us and the government on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.116" offset="1371707">We cite in our blue brief statutes from Arizona as well as a couple of other States where there are crimes that are classified as felonies but punishable in less than a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.875" offset="1414757">And in those cases we agree with the government that that is the effect of the 1994 conforming amendments, is to exclude those outlier States that take low-level crimes and nonetheless classify them as felonies.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.417" offset="1456867">What this case is about--</text>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="328.652" offset="1461882">But if I could just come back to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.510" offset="1469301">I looked at those.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.432" offset="1472958">You cite Ohio, North Carolina, and Arizona and those are all punishable by... they all have a maximum term of 12 months, not less than.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.975" offset="1519143">So the difference is between 12 months and 12 months and a day?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="347.942" offset="1538996">--Well, that works on the language of the statute, Justice Alito.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="352.282" stopTime="362.154">
            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="352.282" offset="1556341">But is it plausible that's the reason why Congress added this language?</text>
            <text syncTime="355.688" offset="1570029">They didn't want... they wanted to make sure that these felonies that were punishable by just 12 months would not be counted?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jeffrey_l_fisher" startTime="362.154" stopTime="463.410">
            <label>Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="362.154" offset="1595838">Well, I think it is quite plausible that the language that Congress added has very little practical effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.558" offset="1621438">And that flows from the fact that Congress called these nothing more than conforming amendments, so Congress apparently wasn't trying to accomplish any dramatic change here and I think it might help to understand by looking at the other outlier states that the government claims got swept in with the 1994 amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.223" offset="1688103">We cite statutes from States like Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.221" offset="1704089">Perhaps if I used a concrete example.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.143" offset="1715792">Take possession of a single ounce of marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.218" offset="1728122">That is one of the crimes in Arizona that we were just talking about, that is a felony punishable by no more than a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.764" offset="1750274">There are a few other States who are outliers in a different sense, in which they call these crimes misdemeanors, like the vast majority of States, but make them punishable by 18 months or more.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.946" offset="1799071">And so what the government's position is is that in 1994 when Congress passed a conforming amendment to exclude a couple of outlier States like Arizona, it was trying to sweep in for the first time into section 841(b)(1)(A) outlier States like Colorado that treat low-level drug crimes, low-level drug possession crimes, as misdemeanors that are punishable by more than a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.686" offset="1886006">So we think, for the very reasons the government explains, that Congress is trying to avoid disuniformity and happenstance according to how a few local jurisdictions might treat certain drug crimes, that it makes sense to read the '94 conforming amendments as requiring both the one-year punishment rule and the felony classification requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.929" offset="1970956">And if you have any doubt on that, we submit it really makes sense to remember that what we're what talking about here is a mandatory minimum.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.521" offset="1997288">And so--</text>

            <text syncTime="1587.377" offset="6496723">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress answered the question presented in this case when it adopted an express definition for "felony drug offense".</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.560" offset="6549490">Under that definition, "felony drug offense" means an offense punishable by more than one year of imprisonment under certain State, Federal, or foreign drug laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.025" offset="6591391">There is no textual basis for going beyond that definition to also require that an offense be classified as a "felony".</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.897" offset="6622842">The enhancement trigger in the sentencing-enhancement provision is a felony drug offense, and the way that the definition works is that you take the definition Congress provided for "felony drug offense".</text>

            <label>Ms. Nicole A. Saharsky</label>
            <text syncTime="1676.187" offset="6851988">--The term "felony drug offense" has only the meaning that Congress gave to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.670" offset="6869960">In the words it shows that it be punishable by more than one year under State, Federal or foreign law relating to those particular drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.651" offset="6897859">In fact, the question that you asked shows why Petitioner's reading of the statute cannot be correct, that you can't use both the definition of "felony drug offense" that Congress provided and try to import in separate definitions for "felony" and separate definitions for "drug", because the definition of "drug" in the Controlled Substances Act is very broad and applies to many different kinds of drugs, whereas the definition of "felony drug offense" only refers to offenses that involve narcotic drugs, anabolic steroids, marijuana or depressant or stimulant substances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.435" offset="7025023">In the same way, this shows why Petitioner cannot be correct that the definition of "felony" also must be brought into "felony drug offense", because Congress chose that the measure of seriousness in "felony drug offense" is an offense punishable by more than one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.352" offset="7084687">And it actually took out of the statute the measure of seriousness which is classification as a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.458" offset="7109033">So to bring that requirement back in would undo the change that Congress made in 1994.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.409" offset="7128886">That's the language, Justice Ginsburg, that we were looking at at the bottom of the... at the back of the blue book.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.392" offset="7148844">In 1988 it said</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.360" offset="7152710">""Felony drug offense" means an offense which is a felony. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.890" offset="7166816">And that language was taken out and Congress replaced it with this new language, which says</text>

            <text syncTime="1762.060" offset="7195446">What do you do with your friend's argument that the classification... or the term, more than one year or less than one year, doesn't always have to do with how serious they view the offense, but they may impose a sentence of more than one year to allow time for rehabilitation?</text>

            <text syncTime="1783.160" offset="7279874">because it believed it to be a good measure of seriousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.799" offset="7290427">This Court has recognized in cases like Blanton versus City of North Las Vegas that the term of imprisonment that a legislature chooses is a good measure of the seriousness of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.435" offset="7337030">There may be offenses that a State classifies as more or less serious based on punishment, but Congress wanted to do its best to get uniformity in provision... in this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.041" offset="7367436">So what it did here was to take out this requirement that would look to varying State and foreign laws and instead have one that was just based on term of imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.661" offset="7413934">And actually this... this raises a very serious problem with Petitioner's reading of the statute, which is with respect to foreign offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.222" offset="7436086">The "felony drug offense" definition allows an enhancement based on State, Federal or foreign offenses, and the definition of "felony" unadorned and standing by itself doesn't refer to foreign offenses at all, which means that there is a serious ambiguity if both apply as to what would be done in the case of trying to enhance based on a foreign offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="1855.114" offset="7567743">But we understand in 1994 that Congress... the change Congress made to be one that eliminates those kinds of ambiguities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.222" offset="7596165">And certainly, if Congress had thought in 1994 that both the separate definition of felony and the definition of felony drug offense mattered, that it would have placed foreign offenses in the definition of felony, and it didn't do that here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1890.881" offset="7710790">New Jersey and Maine are the only ones that I'm aware of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.489" offset="7721239">Certainly, as this Court discussed in some previous questions, there may be ways in which courts could try to work around ambiguities that, for example, existed in the statute 1990... prior to 1994, to figure out how offenses in New Jersey should be treated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.905" offset="7782888">But the fact that Congress made the change in 1994 to pick clear language that would just turn on the authorized term of imprisonment shows that that's what should be used, that choice should be given effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.635" offset="7829804">The fact that courts might be able to deal with an ambiguous statute certainly does not give license to create one where it doesn't otherwise exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.118" offset="7855717">There's an example the Petitioner raised, which is how violent felonies are treated in the Armed Career Criminal Act, and I think that that... that illustrates how Congress could have done what Petitioner wanted if that was, in fact, its intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.533" offset="7917366">In the ACCA, a violent felony, which could be the basis for a sentence enhancement, is defined as various violent offenses that are punishable by imprisonment exceeding one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.170" offset="7951952">But then Congress specifically decided that it wanted to exempt state misdemeanor offenses that it didn't consider serious enough to qualify as violent felonies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.058" offset="7987479">So it exempted State offenses that are classified as misdemeanors and punishable by less than two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.304" offset="8016423">And we think that the Congress' treatment in the ACCA exempting specific State offenses shows that if Congress had wanted to exempt offenses classified as misdemeanors in the way that Petitioner suggests, then it would have done so in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.720" offset="8066160">Congress chose a meaning here for "felony drug offense" and we think that it needs to be given effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="2017.191" offset="8215998">The point that we were making in our brief is that the purposes behind the rule of lenity are really implicated to a lesser extent when we're talking about sentencing, and particularly with respect to mandatory minimums, because there's not a question of whether the offense conduct at issue is illegal, and there's not a question about the maximum offense, the maximum term of imprisonment that the person could be subject to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.557" offset="8301471">So, our brief should be best understood as a response to Petitioner's extensive historical discussion of the rule of lenity and a suggestion that it applies with even more vigor in the context of mandatory minimums.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.630" offset="8341804">We don't think that that's the case, but at the same time we are not suggesting there is a new different rule of lenity in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.331" offset="8368553">And again, we don't see this as a rule of lenity case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.253" offset="8380256">Congress picked a particular definition and it used those terms... that term "felony drug offense" to trigger each of the sentencing enhancement provisions here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.406" offset="8412857">We don't think there is any reason to look beyond it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.812" offset="8422470">If the Court has no further questions, Government submits the judgment below should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2209.941" offset="8987028">Justice Holmes said the statute must be clear.</text>

            <text syncTime="2214.720" offset="9006150">That was in a context where the question was whether or not the conduct was criminal at all not since.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="2221.826" offset="9034571">If you apply clear statement rule to the sentencing code, I don't think we are going to be able to get beyond the second sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2231.449" offset="9073023">--Well, I think with due respect what you're going to do is actually reduce the number of cases this court hears, because once you have a clear statement rule, two things are going to happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.650" offset="9101863">The lower courts are going to find it more... easier to resolve these kinds of cases because just like in the sovereign immunity and Federalism context, it's much easier to look for a clear statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.553" offset="9141464">And even more importantly, Congress will know that when it legislates in the realm of criminal sentencing, that it needs to be clear, and it will solve this case... this Court the problem, perhaps, of having four or five cases on its docket every term involving circuit splits and how to apply mandatory minimums in the vast labyrinth of Federal criminal sentencing provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.872" offset="9222757">So we think this Court can rest assured, of course, that if it rules for the Petitioner in this case and Congress doesn't like the result, that it is well and able and ready to step in to solve that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.007" offset="9275316">The problem is, is that if this Court accepts broad readings of the government, from the government of criminal statutes, that the institutional forces that drive legislation are... make it much less likely that Congress can step in to solve that problem in favor of criminal defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.328" offset="9336547">So for the reasons we've explained, we think this Court should go back to the historical understanding brought forward to the present of the importance of the rule of lenity, and in this case find that the statute does not clearly and unambiguously apply to Petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.105" offset="9391613">If there are no further questions, I'll submit the case.</text>
