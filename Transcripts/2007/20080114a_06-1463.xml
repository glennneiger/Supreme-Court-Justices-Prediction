            <label>Mr. Joseph D. Schleimer</label>
            <text syncTime="9.753" offset="208734">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: It's been a little less than two years since this Court handed down the decision in Buckeye Check Cashing Service v. Cardegna.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.597" offset="260143">Within nine months after Buckeye was decided, the California Court of Appeal issued its decision in this case excising the issue of validity or legality of a contract from an entire category of arbitrations, declaring it off limits to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.624" offset="332241">The contract in this case couldn't be more clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.862" offset="353139">It states quite specifically that the validity or legality of the contract shall be arbitrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.282" offset="378843">So there was no consideration given to the intent of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.468" offset="395561">The Federal Arbitration Act, of course, applies in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.788" offset="412907">There was never really a dispute about that, because it'S a contract between the citizens of two States and it was never disputed that the Federal Arbitration Act would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.429" offset="459405">If left standing, the decision in this case could result in a multiplicity of State law decisions and statutes eliminating arbitration in entire classes of cases through the mere expediency of having it go to an administrative agency.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="88.105" stopTime="96.628">
            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="88.105" offset="522099">Well, It wouldn't eliminate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.389" offset="527219">Your friend on the other side says it the simply delays it, because you get to arbitrate de novo after the commissioner's decision.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joseph_d_schleimer" startTime="96.628" stopTime="131.901">
            <label>Mr. Joseph D. Schleimer</label>
            <text syncTime="96.628" offset="556267">Well, the assertion that we get to arbitrate de novo is new in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.465" offset="579568">In the courts below the parties agreed, and both sides briefed, the fact that the de novo would be heard by the superior court, not by the arbitrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.720" offset="612587">I don't know what... by what magical process the Respondent would think that we would get to arbitrate the de novo, because the statute on which the court of appeal based its jurisdictional holding, Labor Code Section 1700.44, that's where the labor commissioner gets jurisdiction from the same statute and says the superior court hears the de novo.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="131.901" stopTime="139.372">
            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="131.901" offset="697328">Well, I guess I could let him answer, but I suppose he would say you go to that court, and you get a motion to compel arbitration.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joseph_d_schleimer" startTime="139.372" stopTime="144.942">
            <label>Mr. Joseph D. Schleimer</label>
            <text syncTime="139.372" offset="727212">Well, we have brought a motion to compel arbitration, which was denied based on 1700.44.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="144.942" stopTime="166.405">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="144.942" offset="749468">I couldn't find the order that the court... in the record it says that the order would be... the court granted a preliminary injunction, the superior court, and then it said, according to an order to be entered by the clerk.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.183" offset="798474">How long was the arbitration stayed for?</text>
            <text syncTime="160.903" offset="813312">There was an enjoined... there was an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.770" offset="820835">What was the term of the injunction?</text>
            <text syncTime="164.622" offset="828149">Just until further order of the court?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joseph_d_schleimer" startTime="166.405" stopTime="200.559">
            <label>Mr. Joseph D. Schleimer</label>
            <text syncTime="166.405" offset="835359">The injunction states... and I'm implying this, because it doesn't actually state how long it lasts... the injunction was requested and it was granted with just the word "grant".</text>
            <text syncTime="178.296" offset="882902">So I interpret it as meaning that what was granted was what was requested, and what was requested was an injunction that would last until the Labor Commissioner determined that she doesn't have jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.936" offset="933475">Now, since the Labor Commissioner had already determined that she does have jurisdiction, it's effectively permanent or, as you say, Justice Kennedy, until the court vacates it.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="200.559" stopTime="214.052">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="200.559" offset="971927">Did the Respondent at any point indicate that after the Labor Commission, Labor Commissioner, made a determination that they would not go to superior court for de novo review?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joseph_d_schleimer" startTime="214.052" stopTime="271.638">
            <label>Mr. Joseph D. Schleimer</label>
            <text syncTime="214.052" offset="1025948">Well, they actually had in a sense an opportunity to do exactly that and chose not to.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.104" offset="1046115">The motion for reconsideration was brought before the Labor... before the arbitrator one day before the injunction hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.877" offset="1081223">The arbitrator said: Well, it's inefficient to have parallel proceedings and maybe I can benefit from the Labor Commissioner's advice in this.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.084" offset="1122079">So while retaining his jurisdiction, he said: I'm going to stay the arbitration until the Labor Commissioner rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.888" offset="1149246">Now, at that point the Respondent could have simply withdrawn the injunction and said, fine, we'll do it the way the arbitrator says; what the arbitrator wants, the arbitrator shall get.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.129" offset="1190206">Instead, the next day the arbitrator's decision became moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.680" offset="1204417">Now, I think the arbitrator, acting with an injunction looming the next day, was proposing in a sense a kind of compromise: You can both have a little bit of what you want.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.371" offset="1247153">It's not unusual in arbitrations for that to happen.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="271.638" offset="1256244">Well, you may have a right to go to arbitration under this context, to proceed at once to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.392" offset="1283307">But could you stop a parallel proceeding from going on before the Labor Commission?</text>
            <text syncTime="286.498" offset="1315699">In other words, your adversary says under the arbitration contract I'm stuck, I have to arbitrate at once, but I can go to the Labor Commission; there's nothing in the Federal Arbitration Act that says I can't do that.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joseph_d_schleimer" startTime="300.492" stopTime="325.290">
            <label>Mr. Joseph D. Schleimer</label>
            <text syncTime="300.492" offset="1371705">Justice Ginsburg, I think that if the motion to compel arbitration had been granted... remember there were two motions pending, my motion to compel arbitration and the Respondent's motion for an injunction to stop the arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.417" offset="1431369">If the motion to compel arbitration had been granted, I think that would have been in effect a mandamus to Judge Ferrer that he had to arbitrate and not proceed.</text>

          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="325.290" stopTime="348.239">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="325.290" offset="1470866">I would have thought you would... you would say that when you have a contract which says that any disputes under this shall be arbitrated pursuant to the rules of the AAA or whatever, that that does automatically exclude a parallel proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.704" offset="1544531">Otherwise, provisions like that make no sense at all; they achieve nothing.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Joseph D. Schleimer</label>
            <text syncTime="348.239" offset="1562712">Justice Scalia, I would certainly agree that it's a breach of the contract to file a parallel proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.059" offset="1585909">The question, of course, is specific performance.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="357.261" offset="1598761">What do you... what do you make, in answering Justice Scalia's question, what do you make of the fact that this contract included, I guess, a choice of law provision to the effect that California law applies, and if California law comes in so does the jurisdiction of the Labor Commissioner?</text>
            <text syncTime="373.954" offset="1665530">So that in effect you have implicitly agreed to take the Labor Commissioner as well as agreeing to arbitrate, and the argument is the Labor Commissioner comes first.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joseph_d_schleimer" startTime="385.661" stopTime="449.021">
            <label>Mr. Joseph D. Schleimer</label>
            <text syncTime="385.661" offset="1712342">Well, Justice Souter, I have two responses to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.732" offset="1728642">My first is that, since there's an express agreement to arbitrate validity or legality, that there is certainly no basis for saying that there's some implied intent to contradict the express agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.956" offset="1777543">The second is that, assuming for a moment that we have incorporated California law wholesale, and California has a lot of law, one of the laws that California has, as set forth in the case I cited, Qualcomm v. Nokia, a Federal Circuit decision in 2006 under California law, California law has a rule that if you incorporate the AAA rules into your agreement, you meet the First Option standard that you have agreed to arbitrate arbitrability.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.177" offset="1910455">Now, if we have incorporated California law, we have incorporated the law that says the arbitrator's decision, his initial decision saying I've got jurisdiction, let's hear some evidence, then that's incorporated in California law--</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="449.021" offset="1965834">Do you agree that the question of implicit option of California law is at issue in the case as it gets to us?</text>

            <text syncTime="460.160" offset="2010347">If you look at the court of appeals decision, the decision is based on jurisdiction, it's not based on intent of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.982" offset="2037619">Volt is all about the intent of the parties that you imply from a choice of law clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.886" offset="2065204">And if the intent of the parties is so clearly expressed that we're going to arbitrate a particular issue, I don't think you even get to an implied intention.</text>

            <text syncTime="484.777" offset="2108776">Wouldn't it be a question of contract interpretation as to the meaning of the choice of law provision that should be decided by the arbitrator?</text>

            <text syncTime="500.554" offset="2171888">But in the alternative, I think under First Options it should be remanded to the arbitrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.422" offset="2191428">If they want to make an argument that we didn't intend to arbitrate arbitrability, even though California law is per se on that point in our favor, then you have the option of remanding that question to the arbitrator.</text>

            <text syncTime="724.329" offset="3067052">The Labor Commissioner is considered a peace officer under California law.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.131" offset="3086278">They actually have the power to arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.249" offset="3094742">At one point many years ago, there was an arrest of a manager for soliciting and procuring.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.487" offset="3119610">He got Jane Wyman a job on a TV show called "Falcon Crest", and there was an arrest and there was a criminal statute at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.528" offset="3159839">And the legislature responded to this incident by repealing the criminal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.181" offset="3182409">So the only action the legislature has had since deregulating the managers and taking them out of the statute entirely was removing the criminal enforcement power.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.704" offset="3224518">In terms of the Labor Commissioner's civil enforcement powers, there are statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.358" offset="3243117">The first hundred sections in the labor code do give the Labor Commissioner certain intervention powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.762" offset="3268717">But, reading those statutes, they would seem to apply in wage cases and confiscation of tools, that sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.451" offset="3303512">They don't really mention... now would the Labor Commissioner... if the Labor Commissioner wanted to intervene, I think that if you take the penumbra of all these statutes probably the Labor Commissioner could.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.191" offset="3350428">I think, even though there's not in my 20 years handling these cases been a situation where the Labor Commissioner filed any kind of a civil proceeding, everybody assumes the Labor Commissioner could seek an injunction if they wanted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.249" offset="3402673">It just doesn't occur because they're busy doing things like collecting wages.</text>

            <text syncTime="3090.253" offset="12530693">I would disagree that there wasn't an evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.509" offset="12555770">I don't think the evidence is considered, but in addition to Mr. Preston's declaration, I made an offer of proof which is in the appellant's appendix at page 219.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.615" offset="12592133">I offered to prove that the Judge Alex television program is solicited and procured by an agent of the William Morris Agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.719" offset="12624629">I had made two attempts to depose Judge Ferrer to prove that, and I never got the chance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.539" offset="12643855">He didn't want to be deposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.125" offset="12650229">So, there was a full evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.827" offset="12660992">The evidence just wasn't considered because the legal standard that was applied was there's a colorable claim under the Talent Agencies Act, so you can't arbitrate until it's resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.465" offset="12707594">Now I saw this as being a long trek through the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.519" offset="12723790">I don't know when the arbitrator gets to make his decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.721" offset="12736642">If... if the Labor Commissioner rules that the contract is void and then we have a de novo and the Superior Court does that, and the court of appeal does it, and then the California Supreme Court rules the contract is void, does the arbitrator get to overrule that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3155.445" offset="12791499">Regardless of the... I now understand better than I did what I take as a pretty strong argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.334" offset="12827026">I'm not saying convincing, but strong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.852" offset="12837161">And that would be this: If you go look at Volt, and in Volt the Court said that the California Code meant that the individual who'd entered into the arbitration contract could go and can ask a superior court to stay an arbitration while some unrelated... some unrelated... I mean directly related but not the same parties... litigation took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.008" offset="12969759">The Court didn't in Volt say that that question of interpreting this contract is for the arbitrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.263" offset="13002778">I don't know why it didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.965" offset="13009570">But it didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.665" offset="13016361">Now here he's making a parallel argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.352" offset="13031095">He's saying that the California Code says that people should first go to that Labor Commissioner and that you can stay arbitration while that goes on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.427" offset="13083444">Now... and I say well, why don't you go to the arbitrator?</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.147" offset="13102252">He says I don't want to go to the arbitrator on that one, but he points to Volt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.301" offset="13126912">And so the puzzle is this: if the Court in Volt didn't say this is a matter for the arbitrator, whether the contract really means that you promise not to go into court and make a motion to stay, why here is it a matter for the arbitrator whether you implicitly promised not to go into court and asked him to stay pending the outcome of this administrative proceeding?</text>

            <text syncTime="3266.218" offset="13234536">I certainly think that the arbitrator had jurisdiction to arbitrate arbitrability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.872" offset="13257210">And the reason for that is the Qualcomm case and the Dream Theater case is a California case cited in Qualcomm, and that the arbitrator should have decided all these issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.912" offset="13301305">I would make this observation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.763" offset="13308724">If we... if we had gone to the arbitrator and Judge Ferrer had said look, this contract is illegal, said you don't have jurisdiction, and I want you to rule you don't have jurisdiction, the same illegality issue would be a defense on the merits.</text>
