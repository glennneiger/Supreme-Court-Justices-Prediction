            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104745">Justice Alito has our opinion in case 07-320, Davis versus Federal Election Commission.</text>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="7.388" offset="134211">And this case comes to us on appeal from United States District Court for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.574" offset="155005">Federal campaign finance law limits the contributions to candidates for the House of Representatives may receive from individuals and political parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.955" offset="192516">These limits generally apply equally to all candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.034" offset="208817">However, Section 319 of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, part of the so-called, “Millionaires Amendment,” departs from this general rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.912" offset="252389">When a self-financing candidate spends more than $350,000 of personal funds and certain other conditions are met.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.981" offset="288647">Section 319(a) expands the normal contribution limits but only for the candidate's non-self-financing opponent.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.139" offset="321248">To make it possible to tell when this -- a symmetrical regime applies, Section 319(b) requires the self-financing candidate to disclose certain information about his or her personal campaign expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.886" offset="380285">Appellant Jack Davis, a candidate for the House in 2004 and 2006 challenged the constitutionality of Sections 319(a) and (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="81.207" offset="429499">A three-judge panel with the District Court concluded that Davis had standing but rejected his challenge on the merits, and Davis appealed to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.387" offset="462205">We agree that Davis possesses spending and that his claims are not moved.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.890" offset="480281">However, we conclude that Sections 319(a) and (b) violate the First Amendment and we therefore reverse the judgment of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.757" offset="511733">If Section 319(a)'s expanded contribution limits were available to both self-financing and non-self-financing candidates, Davis would have no constitutional claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.177" offset="557395">By expanding contribution limits only for non-self-financing candidates however, Section 319 (a) burdens the self-financing candidate's right in the words of Buckley versus Valeo to spend personal funds to, "vigorously and tirelessly advocate his own election."</text>
            <text syncTime="133.633" offset="639210">Section 319(a) does this because if a candidate vigorously exercises the right to use personal funds for campaign speech that candidate's opponent obtains substantial and unprecedented fund raising advantages.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.125" offset="697202">This burden is not justified by any compelling state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.489" offset="710681">Reliance on personal funds rather than campaign contributions reduces, rather than increases the threat of corruption and perception of corruption.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.069" offset="748925">And we have never recognized the interest that the Government has asserted in defending the constitutionality of this provision, that is an interest in leveling electoral opportunities as a legitimate Government interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.315" offset="802005">Endorsing that interest would have ominous implications for voter's authority to evaluate the strengths of candidates for public office.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.127" offset="833248">Because Section 319(a)'s asymmetrical contribution regime imposes a significant burden on First Amendment rights that is not justified by a compelling state interest that cannot withstand First Amendment scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.868" offset="880164">And because Section 319(b)'s disclosure requirements exist merely to implement Section 319(a)'s unconstitutional regime to burden those requirements, imposes likewise unwarranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.514" offset="930737">Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part which Justice Souter, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer have joined in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.661" offset="963338">Justice Ginsburg has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part which Justice Breyer has joined.</text>
