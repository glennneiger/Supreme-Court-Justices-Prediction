            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="169206">We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 06-1717, Richlin Security Service versus Chertoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.189" offset="209957">Mr. Wolfman.</text>

            <label>Mr. Brian Wolfman</label>
            <text syncTime="11.039" offset="213301">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Federal Circuit affirmed an award of attorney fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act, or EAJA, to Petitioner Richlin Security Services Company, but it denied Richlin an award for paralegal services at market rates on the ground that statutory attorney fees do not include work done by paralegals.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.804" offset="304416">The Federal Circuit was wrong because, as this Court has explained, the statutory term "attorney fees"... and now I'm quoting...</text>
            <text syncTime="41.541" offset="335345">"takes into account the work not only of attorneys but others whose labor contributes to the work product for which an attorney bills her client. "</text>
            <text syncTime="50.064" offset="369408">Employing that reasoning the Court held, in Missouri versus Jenkins, that paralegal fees are compensable at market rates as attorney fees under 42 U.S.C. section 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.804" offset="420399">The question in this case is whether there is any reason EAJA should be interpreted differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.191" offset="441924">The answer is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.977" offset="449030">And, indeed, the only potentially relevant difference between the two statutes... that EAJA requires fees to be awarded at prevailing market rates, and section 1988 requires only that fees be reasonable... provides stronger support for market-based recovery of paralegal fees under EAJA than it would under section 1988.</text>

            <text syncTime="91.491" offset="535129">Mr. Wolfman, what about the cap that's not present in 1988 and is present in EAJA?</text>

            <text syncTime="98.295" offset="562297">Well, Justice Ginsburg, that really is, when we get down to it, what the government's argument boils down to.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.583" offset="591449">And I think the cap is irrelevant for two reasons, both of which are important.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.435" offset="606914">First, and let me... let me first state the argument; then I'll give you the answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.672" offset="631887">But the argument that the government posits is... taking a lead from the Federal Circuit... is that paralegal services can't be compensable at market rates under EAJA because then paralegal services would be fully or largely compensable, while lawyers' fees to the extent that they exceed the cap would not be.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.753" offset="708164">And again there are two answers to that: First, the argument incorrectly looks at EAJA from today's perspective when lawyers' rates generally exceed the fee cap.</text>

            <text syncTime="383.923" offset="1704893">In fact, what the Court pointed out in Missouri versus Jenkins, which was 1989, nine years later, paralegal fees... it appeared to be that they were separately billed in about three-quarters of all law firms.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.330" offset="1758496">In 1980 it was probably fewer.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.265" offset="1766228">There was a transition going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.415" offset="1770826">But let me give you the Court's response to that problem in Missouri versus Jenkins, to the extent that it is a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.705" offset="1803949">And what the Court said was, whether they're separately billed or not, they were subsumed within the lawyer's rates like other forms of overhead.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.679" offset="1847835">That's what the Court said in Missouri versus Jenkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.215" offset="1857970">And the question of how they are billed doesn't... doesn't inform the question of how you interpret the term "attorney's fees".</text>
            <text syncTime="430.884" offset="1892661">That's what the Court said in Missouri versus Jenkins and what it reaffirmed two years later in the West Virginia Hospitals versus Casey.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.390" offset="1926724">Now, let me, if I could, get to the second point which Justice Kennedy asked me about.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.294" offset="1942293">The second point is that the government's argument proves far too much, because under the Federal Circuit's theory, which the government has now adopted, the fees generated by law firm associates would also not be compensable at market rates because a much higher percentage of an associate's billed rate would also fall below the cap as compared to the senior partners in the firm.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.308" offset="2034349">In other words, it doesn't help explain the problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="510.237" offset="2210101">Our point is that it proves far too much because the junior associates are much more like the paralegals than the senior associates at the largest K Street or Wall Street law firm.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.644" offset="2255763">And my only point... my only submission... point in that regard is that it shows that the government's argument proves too much because it illustrates that the government's concern and the Federal Circuit's concern, the anomaly that they have pointed out, has nothing to do with the statutory term "attorney fees" and nothing to do with paralegals, per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.446" offset="2358894">It's the phenomenon that's at work is the fact that the rate... the hyperinflation in the legal services market as a whole has outstripped EAJA.</text>

            <text syncTime="584.035" offset="2505284">I think it, in part, undermines the government's position because what happened here is that the Federal Circuit and the Board of Contract Appeals below said, well, it's cost to the lawyer, and we are going to do an Internet search and we are going to find what paralegal salaries are and divide it by the requisite number of hours in any year.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.966" offset="2593056">And we are going to make it $35 an hour, and we are going to determine that's the cost to the law firm.</text>

            <text syncTime="1260.410" offset="5210839">But I think the other answer to that is the ethical constraints.</text>

            <text syncTime="1275.837" offset="5272488">But a lawyer can't shunt off work that they can't handle because there are ethical constraints.</text>

            <text syncTime="1316.497" offset="5435178">The real problem, though, is not an attack on the government fisc, as we point out in our brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="1332.423" offset="5498813">It's worth noting, though, that the Federal Circuit's decision would have an impact on clients most affected by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.279" offset="5526293">Three groups comprise the great majority of EAJA applicants: Small businesses like Richlin, disabled veterans, and disabled Social Security claimants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.218" offset="5565999">In all three situations, clients will lose if paralegal services are awarded at the cost of those services to their lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.407" offset="5598809">For the latter two groups, veterans and Social Security claimants, Federal law, in fact, requires that EAJA... that the EAJA fee be paid to the claimant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.347" offset="5634545">So, although it makes economic sense for paralegals to work on significant aspects of Social Security and veterans' cases... and that's set out at some length in the amicus brief of the National Association of Legal Assistants... the claimants will lose those fees under the government's view of EAJA.</text>

            <text syncTime="1399.001" offset="5765157">They are also set forth in footnote 2 of this Court's decision in Scarborough.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.786" offset="5784279">The way the Social Security and veterans situations work... and, again, they comprise the majority of these cases... is that the Federal law allows the lawyer to take a contingent fee out of the back benefits, not to exceed 20 and 25 percent of the veterans' or Social Security claimants' back benefits, respectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.801" offset="5872364">But then what Federal law also provides... and the citations are Public Law 99-80 section 3 and Public Law 102-572 section 506(c)... Federal law provides that to the extent that there is an EAJA fee, the lawyer may not double-dip and has to send that fee directly back to the client.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.149" offset="5961702">So for these relatively impecunious claimants, essentially chopping the paralegal fee in third or in half or something like that would have a real impact on claimants.</text>

            <text syncTime="2703.962" offset="10985049">And then goes on to say: That does not include other costs connected with their representation of a particular interest in a proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.798" offset="11016396">And when Congress did that, it specifically recognized that it was taking a different approach than that taken in other fee-shifting statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.221" offset="11046071">The very next sentence explains that the committee notes that this section is not intended to limit or affect the computation of reasonable attorney's fees under any other provision of law, and gave as an example the Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.279" offset="11098316">That is section 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.529" offset="11107302">So Congress knew from the very beginning that its treatment of attorney's fees as being limited only to attorneys and the larger more capacious category of other expenses, capturing all other costs that an attorney might incur in the representation of a client was one that was both different from other statutes, and one that was intended by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.424" offset="11186819">And it's not reflected not only by the legislative history, but again by fee caps.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.394" offset="11202702">The fee caps I believe you started here were specifically designed and set by reference to attorney's rates, the exceptions to the fee caps... again specifically reference attorneys.</text>

            <text syncTime="3425.774" offset="13872207">I want to start where the discussion left off.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.428" offset="13894881">It harkens back to some things that Mr. Yang said towards the beginning of his argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.213" offset="13914003">He said that, that if the Federal Circuit weren't affirmed, that there would be no meaning to the term "other expenses", but that's just not so; it would begin to lose its meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.120" offset="13961650">It means things like travel, long distance phone, copying, the types of things we think of as out-of-pocket expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.226" offset="13994042">The problem here is they are shoe-horning a... the government is shoe-horning what is always conceived of as an in-house professional service as an out-of-pocket expense, and it just does not fit there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.034" offset="14045242">Let me turn to the legislative history and I'd like to do two things with that before I close.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.338" offset="14062483">The first is, let's presuppose that it should be given some weight, as Justice Breyer has suggested, and the problem is that it just doesn't bear the weight that the government gives the report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.912" offset="14108772">If you look at... and this is discussed at length at page 12 of our reply brief... let's turn for instance to the administrative conference report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.482" offset="14139074">Here's what it says.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.399" offset="14142731">It's a 46 Federal Register 32913.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.934" offset="14160912">It says that: With regard to expenses, they should be compensable whenever the lawyer, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.338" offset="14182542">"ordinarily charges clients separately for such expenses. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.790" offset="14196334">That's the situation today with paralegal expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.325" offset="14206470">Then it's true that the ACUS, the administrative conference, did not issue a hard and fast rule with respect to paralegal expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.578" offset="14239488">But that of course is because the market wasn't uniform at that time as it is today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.196" offset="14257983">Today it's nearly ubiquitous that paralegal services are... are separately billed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.636" offset="14287658">But listen to what the court said... said: Indeed, we decline to issue because, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.706" offset="14312004">"practices with respect to charging clients for paralegal time vary depending on locality and field of practice. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.026" offset="14341262">But that statement reflects exactly our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.744" offset="14356099">That the rule the Court embraced in Jenkins is that the compensability of paralegal services should replicate prevailing practices in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.834" offset="14396537">Now let me just end by... by... on this note.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.570" offset="14415449">If, there is also the question raised about whether you should give any weight to this... this report at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.974" offset="14441049">We say that you should not for the reasons, essentially in Justice Scalia's last question on that topic; but we do... we do talk about why the Jean decision use of that report does not wear the weight that the government gives us, and that's on pages 13 and 14 of our brief, our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.769" offset="14516282">And the reason is, is because in Jean, no one brought to the Court's attention in any of the briefs the problem that the... that legislative history accompanied vetoed legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.411" offset="14562780">It was never brought to the Court's attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.445" offset="14570930">In the Scarborough case three years ago, neither the majority opinion nor the dissent cited that report.</text>
