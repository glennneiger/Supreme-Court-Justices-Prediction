            <text syncTime="10.121" offset="211466">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A clearing futures commodity merchant, an FCM, such as Petitioner, has standing to sue contract markets and clearing organizations of contract markets under Section 25 (b)(1) of the act for their bad faith failure to enforce rules that are required by the act and by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.017" offset="315015">The court of appeal's contrary ruling should be reversed for three reasons, because it's contrary to the text of 25(b)(1), it ignores the essential rule of clearing FCM's such as Petitioner recognized by the Commodity Exchange Act, as well as long-standing industry rules and practices... an assessment with which the expert Federal agency, the Commodity Future Trading Commission concurs... and it's in cross purposes with the goal that Congress sought to achieve in enacting an express private right of action in 25(b)(1) against contract markets, namely to ensure the existence of fair and orderly markets through a system of effective subregulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.827" offset="490244">The plain language of the Commodity Exchange Act confers statutory standing on Petitioner to bring this private right of action against Respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.355" offset="532354">25(b)(1) makes no reference to buyer or seller but instead confers standing on any person who engaged... a person who engaged in any transaction on or subject to the rules of a contract market or licensed board of trade.</text>

            <label>Mr. Drew S. Days, III</label>
            <text syncTime="133.775" offset="706120">Justice Ginsburg, we view this as several subsidiary transactions that ultimately end in the consummation of the contract, but with respect to the rules that we have in mind... first of all Rule 6 (a) talks about... that can be found in the blue brief at 1a... that such contract executed or consummated by or through a member of such contract market.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.419" offset="812700">This is a clearing FCM that does this.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.653" offset="825552">And 6 (a), along with the knife rule, that is the contract markets rule 121(f) and 306(i)(2), essentially indicate the following arrangement: No contract can be dealt with or entered into on a contract market without a guarantee from the clearing FCM.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.799" offset="926176">The FCM becomes the buyer and seller with respect to that particular contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.233" offset="951880">It assumes that contract and then, after assuming that contract, has to clear it immediately, indeed, within one hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.934" offset="982705">So that's... those are the rules under the statute and with respect to the contract market.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.681" offset="1009663">With respect to the clearing organization, Rule 401(a), which is found at the red brief at 6a, indicates that the clearing point, the clearing FCM is the point that deals with the clearing organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.409" offset="1072566">And at that point, there's no communication, no contact... no contract between the investor and the clearing organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.765" offset="1110078">The clearing organization becomes the buyer and seller.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.185" offset="1123766">In other words, the contract is between a clearing FCM on one side of the contract and a clearing FCM on the other side of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.402" offset="1152605">The clearing organization becomes the buyer and seller, but before that happens, it's clear that the clearing organization views the clearing FCM as the party to the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.600" offset="1197327">It is not the investor.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.238" offset="1203910">It is not any other party.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.442" offset="1212791">The important thing also about this process is that the clearing FCM is always financially liable from the very beginning of this transaction, this process, to the very end.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.813" offset="1258244">That is, from the... executing the contract and the consummation of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.687" offset="1273709">For the Court of Appeals to talk about buyer or seller and treat a clearing FCM as a mere creditor or agent really misses entirely the role that clearing FCM's play in this process.</text>

            <text syncTime="302.222" offset="1379870">--Well, it's... it is clear, as I indicated with respect to the rule of the contract market, that the clearing FCM is required to clear that particular order or contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.888" offset="1438489">And, therefore, at that point, the clearing requires some information about the settlement price.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.135" offset="1471508">Here the allegation is that there was fraud at the point where the settlement price was set.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.149" offset="1491570">That then created a problem with the clearinghouse, and at the clearing process there was also a continuing violation because at both points the contract market and the clearing organization should have been applying their rules effectively and carefully, and we suggest here that that was done in bad faith.</text>

            <text syncTime="367.258" offset="1640050">In fact, the... in order to be a contract... a market designated by the CFTC and by the statute, there has to be a commitment to avoiding price manipulation and cornering the market or various other things of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.548" offset="1713193">So that's in the statute, and it's also subject to the rules of the CFTC.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.391" offset="1728553">That's a basic understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.670" offset="1737644">That's a given.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.123" offset="1739420">Indeed, with respect to the whole question of settlement prices and margins, the understanding of those who participate in a commodity futures market is that they will establish their margins with the expectation that those rules will be applied fairly and firmly and in good faith.</text>

            <text syncTime="1456.404" offset="5996543">And the fact that in some cases that might be the customer and in other cases it might be the clearing FCM doesn't mean that there would be duplicative recovery in a single case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1519.129" offset="6247528">I think it is a different thing and there are two different bases on which the Court could rule in our favor, that is, Rule 306(i)(2) of the rules of the exchange that were in effect at the time of these trades specified that... and that's reproduced, I guess, at page 14a of the blue brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.763" offset="6322029">And it said... a second sentence of Rule 306(i)(2) says every such contract when made by a trading member shall be made on behalf of a clearing member, who shall be the buyer or seller of said contract on the terms set forth therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.475" offset="6384827">So one way to rule for Klein in this case is to simply say even if we focus entirely on the moment at which the trade was executed, under the rules of the exchange, Klein was deemed to be the buyer or seller.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.924" offset="6430698">But we are also making the different argument and in a sense we think the more important practical argument, that regardless of where the contract ran during the brief period before the clearing process was consummated, the salient factor is that at the conclusion of the clearing process, the clearinghouse would look directly and only to Klein for satisfaction of any obligations arising out of unsuccessful trades.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.398" offset="6528605">In a sense the clearinghouse could be analogized to a department store in which only the clearing members have charge accounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.411" offset="6560579">And in order for anyone else to make a purchase, he has to make prearrangements with a charge account holder to have permission to charge things to his accounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.127" offset="6595479">And that's essentially what was done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.267" offset="6600076">In order for Eisler to execute trades on the floor of the exchange, he had to have the prior commitment from Klein that Eisler would be allowed to charge trades to client's account.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.826" offset="6638319">And in that situation, we think it's entirely natural to say that Klein engaged in the transaction, even though Eisler was making the decisions as to exactly what trades to execute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1664.324" offset="6828282">That is, the point of the clearinghouse is to give investors assurance that if their trades are successful, they will get paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.336" offset="6856285">And in order for the clearinghouse to pay the winners, it has to have confidence that it will be able to collect from the losers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.288" offset="6872168">And the way that it has that confidence is by identifying a small number of people, clearing FCM's, who have demonstrated financial wherewithal and integrity, and saying we are going to look only to you to satisfy these obligations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1948.461" offset="7964817">And so by using "on", which by definition "on" has to be subsumed in the rules because if a transaction is on a contract market, surely is in some way governed by a rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.129" offset="8003479">So if Congress meant to cover every transaction that is in any way governed by a rule, it wouldn't have had to include "on".</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.954" offset="8030750">So the reason... the fact that "on" is there means, as we discussed in our brief, that this is a special transaction on or subject to the rules singles out a very special category of transactions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2375.557" offset="9673226">Here Congress had to... needed a construction that would link the... the transaction that was being targeted with the rules of the... of the contract market, because that was going to be the test here, was it's all about whether or not contract market violated its rules, and so it needed a construction that referred to a transaction because those are the things that are governed by the rules of the contract market that might be misapplied in the work... in the way that A, B and C talk about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.075" offset="9799240">So it would have had to... even if it had used the phrase, you know, "purchased" or "sold", a commodity for future delivery or an option on a contract for future delivery... it would still have to say on or subject to the rules of a contract market, in order to link back to what it was doing, which was creating a cause of action for the violation of the contract markets own rules with respect to a transaction that was subject to those rules.</text>

            <text syncTime="3494.656" offset="14149568">I... I understand your argument about what "transaction" means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.218" offset="14159808">But even if I accept that argument, explain to me again why "or subject to the rules" doesn't add anything?</text>

            <text syncTime="3508.604" offset="14205366">It adds... in our construction "the transactions that are on" are the transactions that occur on the floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.693" offset="14241728">The transactions that are "subject to the rules" are the ex-pit transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.442" offset="14256775">Once you say Mr. Days of anti-discrimination rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.406" offset="14308602">So it has to have a limited meaning; and, by coupling it with "on", we think that Congress made clear it was referring to trades.</text>

            <text syncTime="3556.412" offset="14396582">Congress meant to capture investors who trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.600" offset="14405359">There are two categories of transactions that meet that test: Those that occur on the exchange, on the... physically on the pit, and those that are within the industry called off-exchange or off-pit transactions defined in Section 6(c) of the act... of the... of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.638" offset="14481532">And so by... the second phrase is meant to capture those trades that may involve investors but don't occur at the pit.</text>

            <text syncTime="3605.300" offset="14592187">And so Congress wrote very carefully, and Congress's focus was, in the wake of Curran... and given what it said... was investors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.452" offset="14624788">Because the... the implied cause of action that the Court recognized in Curran was all about investors.</text>

            <text syncTime="3651.700" offset="14777761">It seems to us that Congress used a phrase in the statute, and that it... that that cannot be changed by a rule that says... if an exchange adopted a rule that said some transaction was on, or subject to, the rules of it, that wouldn't be enough to put it into the statutory language.</text>

            <text syncTime="3674.957" offset="14870757">Your Honors, Mr. Pincus has identified what he views as some temporal gap between the entering into a contract and the involvement of this... the clearing FCM.</text>
            <text syncTime="3691.185" offset="14935750">That simply is not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3692.263" offset="14940034">Klein had a prior commitment to clear Eisler's trade; so even at the time that Eisler was trading, that had to be done with the understanding that Klein was going to back him up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.634" offset="14985487">If one looks at the gray brief at page 21, it references to the rule of Knight... rules of Knight 116 and 118 that make this very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3714.473" offset="15028850">The story is, as we've indicated, that throughout this process the clearing FCM is financially liable and, therefore, is on the hook.</text>
            <text syncTime="3724.657" offset="15069601">When Congress enacted the statute, it was concerned with protecting the public and maintaining credibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3733.418" offset="15104605">We think that this cause of action, this express cause of action for allowing FCMs to sue, is most reliant to the objectives of Congress: The faithful execution by an FCM that deals directly with these entities, the clearinghouse and the commodity contract market.</text>
