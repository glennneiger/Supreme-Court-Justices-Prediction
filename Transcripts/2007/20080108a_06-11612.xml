            <text syncTime="9.231" offset="191032">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Petitioner was not present at the bench conference and did not have the assistance of an interpreter when the magistrate judge solicited his attorney's consent to conduct jury selection.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.615" offset="248606">The record does not reflect the Petitioner personally consented or ever learned of his attorney's consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.190" offset="274833">Whether defense counsel can unilaterally waive a criminal defendant's right to an Article III judge at jury selection, as occurred in this case, is a serious constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.935" offset="321853">Applying the constitutional avoidance doctrine, this Court should avoid answering this question by interpreting the III judge at felony jury selection.</text>

            <text syncTime="92.352" offset="523518">No, we're not making any allegation of discrete error during the jury selection process.</text>

            <text syncTime="110.235" offset="594989">--The Court has discussed the right to voir dire in capital cases and in non-capital cases as it relates to the right to a fair trial, the right to an impartial jury--</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="122.807" offset="645354">So it's derivative from other rights?</text>
            <text syncTime="126.820" offset="661340">In other words, it helps implement the right to a fair trial, in the Batson context helps guard against an equal protection violation, but it's not on its own a free-standing right.</text>

            <label>Mr. Brent E. Newton</label>
            <text syncTime="142.188" offset="722885">--Well, Your Honor, I would say that the Court has said that, in a Federal case particularly, you have a right to an Article III, Section 2 right to a jury, as well as a Sixth Amendment right, and the Court has referred to this as an allocation of Federal judicial power in the people as well as in judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.820" offset="805327">So selecting the jury obviously is a... has constitutional implications with respect to the structure of Article III as well as any personal right a defendant may have to... to an impartial duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.661" offset="848691">The "Additional Duties" Clause is silent about the type of waiver or consent required and the silence is understandable.</text>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="180.770" offset="877216">Well, where a defendant is waiving a jury trial or pleading guilty, that's something that an ordinary person can probably readily understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.246" offset="911071">But how likely is it that an ordinary defendant is going to have any kind of independent opinion on the question of whether it's better for the voir dire to be presided over by a district judge as opposed to a magistrate judge?</text>
            <text syncTime="206.475" offset="980034">Isn't the situation going to be in the vast, vast majority of cases that your client will simply turn to you and say, which do you think is better, and whatever the lawyer recommends, that's what the client is going to do?</text>
            <text syncTime="220.486" offset="1036041">Isn't that the realistic situation?</text>

            <text syncTime="223.297" offset="1047326">Your Honor, I don't think that's necessarily true.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.250" offset="1055058">I've had... I represent people in trial court as well as on appeal, and I've had many clients who like district judges better than magistrates or magistrates better than district judges, depending on how they've encountered them in prior proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.994" offset="1106049">So I don't think that's an assumption I would make.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.541" offset="1116289">And, more importantly, other personal rights... the right to a grand jury, a petty jury... those are rights that a lot of defendants don't understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.632" offset="1148576">I've had to explain to foreign clients what a jury is because they don't have juries in foreign countries.</text>

            <text syncTime="253.472" offset="1168011">But there's a big difference between having a judge trial and a jury of one's peers.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.672" offset="1192776">The difference between having a magistrate judge and an Article III judge to do the voir dire doesn't have... is not a question of the same dimension.</text>

            <text syncTime="270.964" offset="1237915">Well, Your Honor, it's hard to put these rights in terms of relative importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.790" offset="1253275">The Framers clearly believed Article III independence was essential to our separation of powers and to the rights of defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.631" offset="1288593">John Marshall... the Court in Hatter quoted from former Chief Justice John Marshall saying that the rights... the right to an independent judge is perhaps most important in a... in a criminal case because the rights of the most powerful person, the prosecutor, versus--</text>

            <text syncTime="303.562" offset="1368318">And perhaps you could tell me one piece of information.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.059" offset="1382320">In the Federal proceedings that I've observed, it's always the judge who does the questioning, and this one seemed to me extraordinary.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.995" offset="1422026">The magistrate said it was her practice to let the lawyers do it, right?</text>

            <text syncTime="321.974" offset="1441984">--Well, certain judges in Federal court tend to give the lawyers a lot of leeway.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.568" offset="1460374">Other ones... other judges I've appeared before do it themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.692" offset="1472913">I think it depends.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.784" offset="1477197">But ultimately it's the magistrate who is ruling on challenges for cause or ruling on what questions are appropriate.</text>

            <text syncTime="353.744" offset="1569043">So we're really not talking here about giving away any Article III power.</text>

            <text syncTime="365.131" offset="1614601">--Well, Your Honor, the magistrate judges have been permitted to exercise the attributes of Article III power when they are adjuncts.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.581" offset="1648456">The Court in Gomez unanimously thought that the magistrate's role at felony jury selection was not really that of an adjunct because there was no meaningful Article III review of the--</text>

            <text syncTime="384.406" offset="1691714">That may well be, but the reason... the reason presumably is that an Article III judge, which goes... who goes through a much more substantial process of selection and confirmation is much more qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.491" offset="1756080">Now, if you want to make that argument, that's fine, but that's a quite different argument from saying that we're giving away Article III powers to magistrates, right?</text>
            <text syncTime="410.143" offset="1794637">Magistrates are creatures of Article III.</text>

            <text syncTime="412.408" offset="1803727">--Well, I think it's a twofold argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.283" offset="1811251">It's one that we presume that Article III judges who have gone through the Senate confirmation and presidential appointment process, that they are more qualified as a general rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.187" offset="1846882">But it is also an Article III exercise of power because magistrate judges do not have those protections that Article III provides to life-tenured district judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.884" offset="1885647">So it is... it's both of those things.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="435.384" offset="1895678">Would you go back to I think it was to Justice Ginsburg's question about the comparative significance of the waiver here.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.566" offset="1924309">The paradigm examples of waivers that have to be personal are, you know, waivers of counsel, waivers of the right to put the State to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.390" offset="1971643">This question of waiving an Article III judge as opposed to an Article III appointed magistrate just does not seem to rise to the significance of... of the... of the... of those other paradigm waivers and what is... what is your response to that?</text>
            <text syncTime="474.944" offset="2053876">You started to say that, you know, that the Framers said Article III judges are important because they... they have independence and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.488" offset="2088044">But beyond that kind of high theoretical level, is there anything in practical terms that you think brings this kind of a waiver to the point of significance of, say, waiving counsel?</text>

            <text syncTime="496.310" offset="2139349">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.483" offset="2144051">There are basically three characteristics that I can discern in the Court's jurisprudence about other personal rights that must be personally waived by a defendant on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.854" offset="2181563">First of all, it obviously must be a fundamental right, and I think that the Court's decisions in Hatter and Gomez and the plurality opinion in Northern Pipeline,... all those decisions I think establish that the right to an Article III judge at a critical stage of a criminal case is a fundamental right.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.283" offset="2247182">But there's more than just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.003" offset="2250108">That's necessary but not sufficient, because we have lots of fundamental rights that can be waived during the trial by the attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.643" offset="2272678">The other two characteristics are I think what distinguish this right and make it more like waiving counsel and waiving a petit jury and a grand jury and the right to go to trial at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.263" offset="2311130">And besides being fundamental, the second characteristic is that this right concerns the players in the game as opposed to the rules of the game, the framework of the proceedings in the sense of the players.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.256" offset="2363166">The right to a jury trial, the right to a grand jury, the right to counsel, those are rights that concern the players in the game, as opposed to, say, the confrontational--</text>

            <text syncTime="566.407" offset="2419695">I can understand that argument, but Justice Souter's question points out just as a practical matter this is not nearly as important as a failure to object to illegally seized evidence, a post... a post-arrest delay, open courtroom, all of which are subject to waiver.</text>

            <text syncTime="1359.516" offset="5592109">It's done in the very same courthouse that Mr. Gonzalez was tried in because they regularly refer felony guilty pleas to magistrate judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.623" offset="5624606">And in the brief I've cited a couple of cases reported in Westlaw where District Judge Kazen has accepted reports and recommendations where the magistrate judge said, I went over the right to Article III judge with the defendant personally, he executed a waiver, and this was done on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.272" offset="5687195">So, this is not some innovative proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.678" offset="5696808">This has been done since 1979 when they amended Section 3401(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.346" offset="5715512">The legislative history to Section 3401(b) clearly shows that Congress believed the right to an Article III judge was a constitutional right that had to be personally waived by the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.578" offset="5756367">That is further evidence this is a serious constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.622" offset="5772563">The Court should avoid answering that serious constitutional question because you can easily interpret the Federal Magistrate's Act, in particular the "Additional Duties" Clause, to allow for consensual delegation, which Gomez talked about and Peretz talked about, only if it's personal consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.585" offset="5840482">So, this is not a leap of logic to think that Congress would have intended this in a felony case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.254" offset="5863156">Gomez held Congress never intended this, this was not something Congress intended, so the Court is going to have to fill in a gap in terms of what kind of consent is appropriate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1569.618" offset="6432521">Counsel is best equipped to determine whether the magistrate judge's particular style, reputation or practice in addressing prospective jurors or resolving objections outweigh the independence conferred by Article III.</text>

            <text syncTime="1595.183" offset="6534816">I mean, the fact that the lawyer is better situated to make the judgment doesn't mean it's not a fundamental right.</text>

            <text syncTime="1601.964" offset="6561984">And for the few fundamental decisions where the defendant must personally explicitly make, they have a monumental impact on the defendant, and they protect values that extend beyond mere... mere trial strategy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.286" offset="6611198">If a defendant is indicted for a criminal offense, he readily understands he's going to have to decide, do I want to plead guilty, do I want to stand trial, do I want counsel, do I want a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.094" offset="6658428">He does not readily appreciate that decisions that occurred during voir dire, such as whether to have an Article III judge or a magistrate, whether to exercise peremptory challenges, whether to challenge jurors for cause, whether to object to the prosecutor's actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.995" offset="6718091">These are all decisions that are entrusted to counsel's best professional judgment and his fiduciary obligation to represent the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.367" offset="6751528">The defendant... I mean, the defense lawyer also speaks for the client in exercising the defendant's confrontation clause rights, introduce or object to evidence, to object to the closing of the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.172" offset="6794787">There's just a small handful of fundamental rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.250" offset="6811087">And for the vast majority of criminal defendants, they don't even have Article III rights, Mr. Chief Justice; they're in State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.749" offset="6833135">So it's an important right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.309" offset="6839300">It implicates important trial issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.074" offset="6850376">But nonetheless, counsel is best equipped to make it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.306" offset="6863332">And I do think, unlike the decision whether you're going to be convicted or stand trial or even testify, this is a decision where the defendant is overwhelmingly likely to defer to counsel's tactical and strategic judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.429" offset="6915786">In this case, I just wanted to point out one other thing about the magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.520" offset="6928220">As Justice Ginsburg said, she not only let the lawyers pose their own questions to the jurors, she also gave the lawyers each an extra peremptory challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.688" offset="6964896">And that just shows that magistrate judges can have particular styles or practice, and counsel would be uniquely situated to assess the value of that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2293.048" offset="9326261">The defendant has not made a... and his time is not up yet... in effect an assistance of counsel claim, but if he has an objection and he think his right rises to the level to testify, that he has some duty... that the lawyer had some duty of personal consultation, then he can make that Sixth Amendment argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.182" offset="9402852">We don't think it would have any merit because this is no different than the myriad other types of trial rights that belong to counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="2336.251" offset="9499087">I mean I... some room for that for the court, but it's... it's not like it's the right to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.356" offset="9523538">It would be hard to, you know, if there was some argument over objection or how to question prospective jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.916" offset="9557811">There's not a hybrid defense team where the... the judge is always supposed to turn to the defendant and say are you sure you're comfortable with what your counsel is doing?</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.380" offset="9595636">If the Court does conclude that there is error, the Petitioner, we don't think has made the necessary showing for plain error review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.704" offset="9632939">The first problem and the most fundamental is the error is not plain, because this Court has already upheld the role of the magistrate judge in jury selection in Peretz, despite the absence of a personal waiver; and at least four courts have read that decision to allow a magistrate judge to conduct voir dire, either when there is an absence of an objection or there is express consent by defense counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.430" offset="9723845">And even assuming this Court doesn't reach the question of whether the error had an effect on substantial rights, the error did not seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public confidence of criminal proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.864" offset="9769507">The error... the voir dire in this case occurred without incident or objection, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, to anything that the magistrate judge did; and there is no indication... and I don't think we have heard any... there is no indication that the defendant actually disagreed with his counsel's professional judgment to consent to have the magistrate judge, or even had an opinion on the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.089" offset="9854457">And Petitioner's rule would, as I said, open the door to gamesmanship because it would relieve counsel of any obligation to call an error to the court's attention and therefore give the court the opportunity to correct the error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.115" offset="9902523">If there are no questions, we would ask that the Fifth Circuit's decision be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2444.563" offset="9932302">I'd like to return to Section 3401(b), which the plain language of, and the legislative history behind, clearly show a congressional intent in the misdemeanor context for personal waivers on the record by defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.372" offset="9979531">It would be anomalous not to require the same thing, at least in some similar form, in the felony context.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="2463.212" offset="10006908">Could I just... a question that has troubled me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.755" offset="10025089">Basically, what you say that is of such importance here is the composition of a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.206" offset="10058944">I mean, that's what it all boils down to, who's going to rule on the composition of the jury, should it be a magistrate or should it be an Article III judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.653" offset="10096665">But if... you know, if that is... is so fundamental that it needs a special rule that the waiver has to be personal by the defendant, then you can say the same thing about... about objections to... to the Court's failure to permit a strike for cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.616" offset="10176599">That affects the composition of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.803" offset="10185272">Now do you need... do you need the defendant's consent to the judge's ruling on that point, or is it enough if the lawyer makes no objection?</text>

            <text syncTime="2518.799" offset="10229262">It would be enough if the lawyer made no objection, Your Honor, because that is the kind of rule that I described earlier that concerns the heat of the battle of the adversary process, unlike a discreet point in time before.</text>

            <label>Mr. Brent E. Newton</label>
            <text syncTime="2530.778" offset="10277223">The other point I'm trying to make is that the... it's not just the fact that it's a critical stage; it's a critical stage where there is a right to an Article III judge over the critical stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.819" offset="10321422">The Court in Gomez clearly recognized that jury selection is a critical stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.599" offset="10340439">So it is the Article III right that implicates the right to a jury trial, but it is fundamentally the right to an Article III judge that is at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.985" offset="10370010">The Government makes much of its claim that there could be meaningful Article III de novo review of magistrate judge rulings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.137" offset="10398640">The court unanimously in Gomez stated that the Court highly doubted it would be possible to have such review, and it realistically speaking is not possible because delays between the time that the district judge can get back to conduct a review, and in Gomez the Court found... pointed out that if you bring jurors back and question them again, you run the risk of making them hostile... they think they did something wrong... where you don't have that in an erratic situation where you're delegating an evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.500" offset="10508145">Witnesses get recalled all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.126" offset="10514624">They know that's part of the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.639" offset="10520684">So, realistically speaking, there is no de novo review, which is why it's not an adjunct situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.528" offset="10544194">It's not the magistrate judge acting as an adjunct; it's the magistrate judge acting as an Article III judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.183" offset="10562794">The Government argues plain error doctrine should apply, Rule 52(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.040" offset="10578258">Justice Scalia's concurring opinion in Freytag noted that there are different kinds of rights that can be waived or forfeited, and most rights can be forfeited short of a waiver, but there are certain kinds of rights... and we contend this is one of them... that cannot be forfeited short of a valid waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.595" offset="10648475">The Court in Barker and in Boykin v. Alabama stated that there are certain personal rights where the prosecution has the entire responsibility to spread on the record the valid waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.812" offset="10689331">And if the prosecution doesn't meet that burden in the trial court, it's illogical to apply the burden on the defendant on appeal when it's the prosecution that would need to assure it was the defendant's personal waiver that happened in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.790" offset="10741262">The Court in Wynn and Glitton and other cases moreover has said, if it's a fundamental question of judicial administration, then it can be raised for the first time on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.692" offset="10784834">I think the Court also should consider the facts of this case in deciding whether there was gamesmanship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.376" offset="10803643">There wasn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.315" offset="10807404">Clearly there wasn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.157" offset="10810748">Mr. Gonzalez was cut out of the equation entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.156" offset="10822764">The magistrate judge only invited the attorneys to the bench, left him sitting there without the assistance of an interpreter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.637" offset="10848678">You have to consider his personal characteristics.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.698" offset="10860903">He had no experience in the Federal criminal justice system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.104" offset="10870516">He did not speak English fluently.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.132" offset="10878666">He was in no position to object.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.961" offset="10885980">He didn't have the meaningful opportunity to object.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.929" offset="10893817">And under Rule 51(b), there should be de novo for that reason as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.003" offset="10914088">I finally I just... I want to return to my main point, which is... I'm not asking the Court to decide as a matter of constitutional law whether a personal waiver is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.202" offset="10950869">I think there's a very strong argument based on the Court's precedent that should happen and--</text>
