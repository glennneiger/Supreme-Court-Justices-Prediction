            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105856">We will hear argument today in Case 07-290, District of Columbia versus Heller.</text>

            <label>Mr. Walter E. Dellinger, III</label>
            <text syncTime="7.121" offset="134277">Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Second Amendment was a direct response to concern over Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, which gave the new national Congress the surprising, perhaps even the shocking, power to organize, arm, and presumably disarm the State militias.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.173" offset="222467">What is at issue this morning is the scope and nature of the individual right protected by the resulting amendment and the first text to consider is the phrase protecting a right to keep and bear arms.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.057" offset="282026">In the debates over the Second Amendment, every person who used the phrase "bear arms" used it to refer to the use of arms in connection with militia service and when Madison introduced the amendment in the first Congress, he exactly equated the phrase "bearing arms" with, quote, "rendering military service".</text>
            <text syncTime="65.734" offset="368752">We know this from the inclusion in his draft of a clause exempting those with religious scruples.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.794" offset="392994">His clause says</text>
            <text syncTime="74.839" offset="405115">"The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed, a well armed and well regulated militia being the best security of a free country, but no person religiously scrupulous of bearing arms shall be compelled to render military service in person. "</text>
            <text syncTime="90.629" offset="468331">And even if the language of keeping and bearing arms were ambiguous, the amendment's first clause confirms that the right is militia-related.</text>

            <text syncTime="101.345" offset="511172">If you're right, Mr. Dellinger, it's certainly an odd way in the Second Amendment to phrase the operative provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.060" offset="546072">If it is limited to State militias, why would they say "the right of the people"?</text>

            <text syncTime="128.251" offset="618796">You will see references in the debates of, the Federalist Farmer uses the phrase</text>

            <text syncTime="155.002" offset="725794">What... what defines the amendment is the scope and nature of the right that the people have.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.842" offset="761216">It's, it is a right to participate in the common defense and you have a right invocable in court if a Federal regulation interferes with your right to train for or whatever the militia has established.</text>

            <text syncTime="178.855" offset="821193">One of the concerns, Mr. Dellinger, of the framers, was not to establish a practice of amending the Constitution and its important provisions, and it seems to me that there is an interpretation of the Second Amendment differing from that of the district court and in Miller and not advanced particularly in the red brief, but that conforms the two clauses and in effect delinks them.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.653" offset="944387">The first clause I submit can be read consistently with the purpose I've indicated of simply reaffirming the existence and the importance of the militia clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.368" offset="991303">Those were very important clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.134" offset="998303">As you've indicated, they're in Article I and Article II.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.975" offset="1013663">And so in effect the amendment says we reaffirm the right to have a militia, we've established it, but in addition, there is a right to bear arms.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.423" offset="1063505">Can you comment on that?</text>

            <text syncTime="243.389" offset="1079387">And this makes, it does... I think you're quite right in the brief to say that the preface shouldn't be extraneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.278" offset="1106868">This means it's not extraneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.947" offset="1113556">The Constitution reaffirms the rights, reaffirm several principles: The right of the people to peaceably assemble, the right to be secure in their homes, the Tenth Amendment reaffirms the rights, and this is simply a reaffirmation of the militia clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="265.116" offset="1166218">Justice Kennedy, I think any interpretation that delinks the two clauses as if they were dealing with related but nonetheless different subject matters has that to count against it, and what you don't see in the debates over the Second Amendment are references to, in those debates, the use of weapons for personal purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.745" offset="1264752">What you see is the clause that, that literally transposes to this:</text>

            <text syncTime="301.319" offset="1311041">Well the subject is "arms" in both clauses, as I've suggested is the common subject, and they're closely related.</text>

            <text syncTime="308.643" offset="1340403">--I think, as this Court unanimously held in Miller, or at least noted in Miller... I'll leave aside the debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.607" offset="1380214">The court unanimously said in Miller that the Second Amendment must be interpreted in light of its obvious purpose to ensure the continuation and render possible the effectiveness of the military forces.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="329.587" offset="1424204">I don't see how there's any, any, any contradiction between reading the second clause as a... as a personal guarantee and reading the first one as assuring the existence of a militia, not necessarily a State-managed militia because the militia that resisted the British was not State-managed.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.060" offset="1514065">But why isn't it perfectly plausible, indeed reasonable, to assume that since the framers knew that the way militias were destroyed by tyrants in the past was not by passing a law against militias, but by taking away the people's weapons... that was the way militias were destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.397" offset="1591387">The two clauses go together beautifully: Since we need a militia, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.</text>

            <text syncTime="378.315" offset="1619077">Yes, but once you assume that the clause is designed to protect the militia, it... surely it's the militia that decides whether personal possession is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.046" offset="1674039">I mean, Miller... what makes no sense is for Miller to require the arm to be militia-related if the right is not, and the key phrase is "bear arms".</text>

            <text syncTime="3060.380" offset="12347358">The Petitioners have had two opportunities to urge courts to adopt this so-called self-defense exception which they construed in the amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.829" offset="12385079">The first opportunity came in 1978 in McIntosh versus Washington, where the petitioners urged the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia to uphold the law because it was irrational in their view to prohibit self-defense in the home with firearms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.306" offset="12447041">They deemed it to be too dangerous, and this was a legitimate policy choice of the City Council, and they actually prevailed in that view.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.085" offset="12470134">The second opportunity that the Petitioners had to urge this sort of self-defense construction was actually in this case in the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.943" offset="12501585">We had a motion for summary judgment and we made certain factual allegations in this motion, and on page 70a of the joint appendix we see portions of our statement of undisputed material facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.485" offset="12547769">Fact number 29, which was conceded by the District of Columbia, reads: The defendants prohibit the possession of lawfully owned firearms for self-defense within the home, even in instances when self-defense would be lawful by other means under District of Columbia law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.727" offset="12604716">The citation for that is a functional firearms ban, and that point was conceded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.932" offset="12617569">Certainly the idea that people can guess as to when it is that they might render the firearm operational is... is not a one that the Court should accept, because a person who hears a noise, a person who perhaps is living in a neighborhood where there has been a spate of violent crimes, has no idea of when the District of Columbia would permit her to render the firearm operational.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.685" offset="12708579">And, in fact, there is a prosecution history not under this specific provision, but certainly other under gun prohibition... laws that we are challenging here today to prosecute people for the possession or for the carrying of a prohibited firearm even when the police ruled the shooting has been lawful self-defense, when there is no prosecution for assault or attempted murder or anything of that--</text>

            <text syncTime="3309.040" offset="13341996">Because when people have handguns... handguns are military arms, they are not just civilian arms... they are better prepared and able to use them.</text>

            <text syncTime="3323.146" offset="13398421">And so if we assume that the sort of military purpose to the Second Amendment is an individual right, then the handgun ban, as noted by our military amici, would impede that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3349.163" offset="13502493">And to maintain that potential today, the closest we come is to say that there is a right for people to understand weapons, to know how to use them, to practice with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.738" offset="13564769">And they can do that, you see, with their rifles.</text>
