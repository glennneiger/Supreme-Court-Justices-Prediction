            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104968">In the first of the two cases, LaRue against the DeWolff Associates, the case comes to us from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.347" offset="150317">The petitioner filed the action against his former employer in the defined contribution punishment -- pension plan that it administers.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.429" offset="190650">The plan permits participants such as LaRue to direct the investment of their contributions in accordance with specified procedures and requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.923" offset="232655">He alleges that the plan administrator failed to follow his investment directions and that that failure resulted in the depletion of the value of his interest in the plan by approximately $150,000 and that that failure was a – a breach of duty under the terms of the Employment Retirement Income Security Act, ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.472" offset="322829">The District Court granted the respondent's motion for a judgment on the pleadings and the Court of the Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.465" offset="354803">Relying on our opinion in the -- the Russel case, the Court of Appeals held that ERISA, Section 502(a)(2) provides remedies only for entire plans and not for specific individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.329" offset="418228">We granted certiorari and now vacate and remand for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.036" offset="441112">For reasons stated in our opinion, we hold that although 502(a)(2) does not provide a remedy for individual injuries distinct from plain injuries, the provision does authorize recovery for – for fiduciary breaches that impair the value of plan assets in a participant's individual account.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.103" offset="521360">The Chief Justice has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment that Justice Kennedy has joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.591" offset="543303">Justice Thomas has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment that Justice Scalia has joined.</text>
