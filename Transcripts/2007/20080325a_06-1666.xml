            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="180256">We will hear argument first this morning in Case 06-1666, and the consolidated Case 07-394, Munaf versus Geren, Secretary of the Army, and Geren versus Omar.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.843" offset="239606">Mr. Garre.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gregory G. Garre</label>
            <text syncTime="17.043" offset="248383">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Under this Court's precedents and universal international law norms, the government of Iraq, like all sovereign nations, has a sovereign right and jurisdiction to try and punish individuals, including American citizens, who voluntarily enter its borders, commit crimes in its country, and remain there.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.708" offset="343051">In two independent respects, the court of appeals in the Omar case lost sight of that principle and departed from this Court's precedents: First by exercising habeas jurisdiction at all; and second by sustaining an injunction that the court of appeals itself recognized prevented the government of Iraq from trying and punishing Mr. Omar for any crimes that he committed in Iraq.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.358" offset="441585">As to the jurisdictional question, we believe that this Court's decision Hirota versus MacArthur points to the conclusion that habeas jurisdiction is lacking over these cases because the habeas petitioners are being held under international authority pursuant to determinations made by an international Multinational Force acting and carrying out a United Nations mandate, and in Mr. Munaf's case pursuant to an order of the Iraqi courts that he remain in custody while proceedings go forward in the trial court.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="100.180" offset="580974">Isn't the problem with the argument that Hirota did not at any point in the per curiam opinion saying... say, we're coming to the conclusion that we come to of no jurisdiction because there's an international force?</text>
            <text syncTime="113.173" offset="632906">I mean, Hirota said, you know, there's this, that, and the other thing, and under all these circumstances we don't think there's jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.493" offset="662163">Well, one of the things that's different here is you had Japanese soldiers in Hirota and you've got American citizens here.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gregory G. Garre</label>
            <text syncTime="129.616" offset="698630">Well, that is the difference, Justice Souter.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.718" offset="707094">And I think, to be clear, if this Court does find jurisdiction in these cases, we think that citizenship would be a basis... would have to be the basis for jurisdiction, and we urge this Court to limit its decision to that ruling, because that would have profound practical consequences.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="146.727" offset="767071">There's another difference, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.346" offset="773549">There was a conviction and a sentence in Hirota, here in Omar's case he has not yet been as far as we know even investigated by the Iraqi courts, certainly no conviction; and in Munaf's case the conviction has been quashed.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="gregory_g_garre" startTime="169.760" stopTime="213.871">
            <label>Mr. Gregory G. Garre</label>
            <text syncTime="169.760" offset="859231">That's true, and let me explain why we think that Hirota does govern the circumstances in this case, notwithstanding that this case involves citizens and notwithstanding that the Petitioners in Hirota had been the subject of an international conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.536" offset="918372">First of all, we don't think that Hirota would have come out differently if the habeas petitioners had filed suit earlier and sought to enjoin the international proceeding in Hirota and sought an injunction that would have prevented the conviction from taking place.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.945" offset="971975">Secondly, we do think that, although one obviously has to take a careful look at the Court's decision in Hirota, we think that what the Court did say points to the conclusion that it was the international authority that was key to the Court's finding that there was no jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.705" offset="1031012">I think there's at least a couple--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="213.871" stopTime="251.127">
            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="213.871" offset="1035714">If it is, there's something... the implication of that I think is what is bothersome, because in effect it means, if that rule is applied to this case, it means that the president acting alone can make an agreement for an international force or a cooperative force and that agreement of the executive alone in effect eliminates habeas jurisdiction over an American citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.557" offset="1150444">And that obviously is in tension, if not inconsistent, with the suspension clause and it's a little scary.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="gregory_g_garre" startTime="251.127" stopTime="278.560">
            <label>Mr. Gregory G. Garre</label>
            <text syncTime="251.127" offset="1184716">--Well, obviously the Court reached that conclusion in Hirota as to aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.031" offset="1204360">With respect to citizens, I think that the key for the jurisdictional question under the habeas statute is whether or not these individuals are in custody under and by color of United States authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.339" offset="1249605">Just as the Court presumably concluded in Hirota that the petitioners in Hirota were not under custody under color of United States authority, we think that the Petitioners here are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.860" offset="1291609">And so we think--</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="278.560" offset="1294431">No, but in real world terms isn't it the case that they are under United States authority?</text>
            <text syncTime="284.348" offset="1317627">You've got an American commander, you've straight-line authority right through, and... and one knows... to be realistic, one knows perfectly well that if any order were given to the American military involved, they would not hand them over, i.e., they would obey the order, international... agreement for international cooperation or not.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gregory G. Garre</label>
            <text syncTime="311.982" offset="1428178">--two points in response to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.967" offset="1432044">First, ultimately the United Nations controls the strings and the source and the scope of international authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.037" offset="1456390">The... the current Security Council resolutions are set to expire in December.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.156" offset="1476870">It could... it could eliminate those resolutions today and that source of international authority would exist and we wouldn't be here arguing that these individuals are being held pursuant to international mandate.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="335.213" offset="1521069">Mr. Garre, just to clarify one point.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.748" offset="1535175">The... at the time of the briefing, the U.N. resolution was due to expire in December of 2007.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.854" offset="1567672">Has it been renewed.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="gregory_g_garre" startTime="347.921" stopTime="380.639">
            <label>Mr. Gregory G. Garre</label>
            <text syncTime="347.921" offset="1571851">There has been a subsequent resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.723" offset="1579061">It's Resolution 1790, and that resolution is set to expire this December.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.758" offset="1599227">And the... the government of Iraq and the other parties have indicated that this will be the last extension.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.310" offset="1621484">Obviously, they'll have to assess the situation in December.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.678" offset="1630888">But the international authority that existed at the time of the briefing continues to exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.816" offset="1651472">The other point I was going to make, Justice Souter, is your point about American domination or influence over the Multinational Force was equally true with respect to the force in Hirota.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.039" offset="1700374">You had--</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="380.639" offset="1702777">I think... I think you're right.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gregory G. Garre</label>
            <text syncTime="383.408" offset="1713853">--So I don't think that that's a basis for distinguishing Hirota.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.610" offset="1726600">The--</text>

          <turn speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="387.143" stopTime="427.937">
            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="387.143" offset="1728795">It may be... I mean, Hirota was a literally, I think, a two or three-day per curiam opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.668" offset="1766829">It occupied less than a page, and it had this kind of whole ball of wax sort of reasoning involved in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.322" offset="1797445">And as precedential authority, if this case turned on the question of whether we look to the theory of international authority rather than, I think, the realistic fact of American domination, I don't think Hirota is a very strong precedent against our at least taking the realistic view of it.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="gregory_g_garre" startTime="427.937" stopTime="471.599">
            <label>Mr. Gregory G. Garre</label>
            <text syncTime="427.937" offset="1891903">--Well, again, I think that Hirota... the amount of influence that the United States forces have over the international force isn't a basis for distinguishing Hirota.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.662" offset="1930878">But to get to your point about citizenship, I guess we would say a few things.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.864" offset="1947701">One, we that think the Justice Douglas in his concurring opinion in Hirota and the court of appeals below recognized that the theory of the Court's decision in Hirota doesn't lend itself to a citizenship exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.255" offset="1997229">The habeas statute, as this Court emphasized in the Rasul case, doesn't have a citizenship... doesn't distinguish between citizens and aliens, and it has since 1789 contained the requirement that the person be in custody under or by color of United States' authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.133" offset="2064729">So--</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="471.599" offset="2066610">So once again you're relying on a concurring opinion by Justice Douglas?</text>

            <text syncTime="476.701" offset="2086986">We're relying on the Court's decision in Hirota, but we look at the concurring opinion; we've looked at the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.788" offset="2107361">We've tried to discern the best principle of law from that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.657" offset="2122826">And the principle that we think it stands for is that where individuals are held under international authority by the judgment of several nations, not the law of any single nation, this Court lacks jurisdiction to review the custody of such individuals.</text>

            <text syncTime="502.534" offset="2190326">Mr. Garre, it is at least equally plausible, I think, because it's the only factor that Hirota mentions more than once, that the Court was going on its lack of power</text>
            <text syncTime="516.211" offset="2245079">"to review, to affirm, set aside, or annul the judgments and sentences imposed. "</text>

            <text syncTime="526.067" offset="2284472">And here we have no judgment or sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.036" offset="2296383">So I don't think you can pick one of these strands, citizenship, and say, oh, that's it and it isn't the judgment and sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.892" offset="2335776">So I think we know your position.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.093" offset="2344553">This is an opinion that says "under the foregoing circumstances".</text>
            <text syncTime="546.545" offset="2366392">I don't think you can take it much further than saying citizenship was one of those circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="552.699" offset="2391051">If I can make a couple of points.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.582" offset="2398574">One, the parties in Hirota, the habeas petitioners, made very clear that they weren't asking this Court to review the international conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.305" offset="2429399">They made very clear that they were asking this Court to review the actions of American officers under United States law.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.474" offset="2458134">They made that clear on page 14 of their merits brief, where they said... and I'm quoting here...</text>
            <text syncTime="573.426" offset="2473912">"We are not asking this Court to review the decision of international court. "</text>
            <text syncTime="586.234" offset="2525112">--end quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.228" offset="2525007">And quoting again:</text>
            <text syncTime="579.396" offset="2524903">"All the questions deal solely with official actions taken by General MacArthur as citizen and U.S. Army officer. "</text>
            <text syncTime="586.900" offset="2527828">And again on page 15, quote:</text>
            <text syncTime="589.852" offset="2539636">"We repeat again that we bring into question only unlawful action taken by General MacArthur for us. "</text>
            <text syncTime="595.190" offset="2560952">The other point that I would make is these individuals... they haven't been convicted pursuant to a trial, like the individuals in Hirota, but these individuals are being held pursuant to determinations made by the Multinational Force carrying out the international mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.967" offset="2624063">In Mr. Omar's case, he not only received a three-judge tribunal shortly after his detention and capture, but he also received a determination before a nine-officer combined review release board, consisting of six Iraqi officials and three Multinational Force officials, who determined that he was a security internee who should be detained in accordance with the United Nations mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.500" offset="2722179">Now, Mr. Munaf's case did proceed before the Iraqi criminal court because an injunction was not entered against those proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.289" offset="2757392">The Iraqi court initially did enter a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.808" offset="2767423">That conviction was reversed on appeal by the court of cassation.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.442" offset="2786023">We think that... that the recent decision is significant in a couple of respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.346" offset="2805562">I think, one, it underscores there is an Iraqi legal system, that that system is capable of processing these cases and hearing from these individuals, and is capable of granting relief where appropriate action isn't taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.054" offset="2856449">And, two, the Iraqi court order setting aside the conviction, much like an appellate order in this country would, remanded the case for further proceedings but directed that Mr. Munaf and his codefendant--</text>

            <text syncTime="2323.756" offset="9475250">First of all, as the Court knows, the habeas statute itself has been amended in a way that excludes access for foreign nationals outside the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.479" offset="9522166">The Court... or rather Congress, very carefully did not exclude it for U.S. citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.615" offset="9542646">Second, there may be limitations on whether foreign nationals can invoke the protections of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.685" offset="9566992">Third, as I pointed out, the extradition treaty bars the transfer of citizens, but does not bar the transfer of non-citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.439" offset="9597921">And fourth, the laws of war allow the United States to transfer Iraqis, but contemplate the continued application of extradition principles that were in place prior to the start of the conflict.</text>

            <text syncTime="2379.073" offset="9696455">What I'm wondering is... when I read the briefs, I put in my mind a spectrum and on one side is the military occupation of Japan, where there is basically peace but it's a military occupation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.000" offset="9756223">On the other side, it's a hot war or a guerilla war where the U.S. forces are rounding up troops, nightly perhaps, and rounding up guerillas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.106" offset="9800632">And I had put this case quite close to the military occupation in my mind because of the nature of these particular individuals' offense and treatment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3976.364" offset="16085693">But we think that it is quite clear from this Court's decisions that if they don't have the authority to enter the preliminary injunctive relief that they did at the end of the day they have no authority to enter it as a preliminary matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3986.220" offset="16125085">I think on the jurisdictional point, the one point I wanted to stress is that if this Court does find jurisdiction we think it has to be because of a reading of the habeas statute informed by the Constitution that's limited to citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3998.944" offset="16175972">Extending jurisdiction to everyone in Iraq would be an extraordinary expansion of this Court's decision in Rasul.</text>
            <text syncTime="4005.098" offset="16200632">Just to be clear, Camp Cropper in Iraq bears none of the characteristics of the Guantanamo Bay that this Court discussed in its opinion in Rasul and that Justice Kennedy emphasized in his concurrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4016.156" offset="16244831">So any jurisdictional ruling by this Court, we would urge it to rule only to the circumstances here of the fact of citizenship.</text>
