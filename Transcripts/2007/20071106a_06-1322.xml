            <label>Ms. Connie L. Lensing</label>
            <text syncTime="10.572" offset="212659">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress clearly set out a statutory scheme in which timely notice and the opportunity for conciliation are required before an age discrimination private suit may be brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.315" offset="275666">While our position is that reading... the reading of ADEA Section 626(d) as a whole shows that "charge" encompasses notice, even if that definition is too broad and you accept only a content definition of "charge", it is clear from the structure of the statute that notice and an opportunity to conciliate before a lawsuit commences is required.</text>

          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="53.801" stopTime="68.494">
            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="53.801" offset="385589">Well, EEOC Form 5 is labelled "Charge".</text>
            <text syncTime="57.303" offset="399591">And would it be your position that if an employee filled out that form and submitted it to the EEOC, but the EEOC made a mistake and did not notify the employer, that that would not be a charge?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="connie_l_lensing" startTime="68.494" stopTime="98.597">
            <label>Ms. Connie L. Lensing</label>
            <text syncTime="68.494" offset="444417">We think the better rule is that it would not be a charge until notice is given, because that's the only rule that is faithful to the statute, that notice is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.600" offset="480780">But equitable tolling is available for such a mistake and that's the exact situation in which equitable tolling should be used, to rectify a true mistake on the EEOC's part at the time, rather than what they have been engaging in of late, which is second guessing the decision made at the time.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="98.597" offset="564789">Well, why don't we do exactly that here?</text>
            <text syncTime="100.616" offset="572835">I mean, you say that the proper thing to do, now a charge labelled Form 5 has been filed, is to dismiss this lawsuit; and then we wait 60 days; and the identical lawsuit is reinstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.725" offset="637305">Why shouldn't the court simply toll the case and say, now we have a proper Form 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.414" offset="676071">The employer didn't get a chance to engage in settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.634" offset="692894">So we hold on to the case and allow the 60 days to elapse, and then the complaint is there.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.977" offset="750259">Why isn't that the appropriate solution for this case?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Ms. Connie L. Lensing</label>
            <text syncTime="147.679" offset="761126">Well, Justice Ginsburg, to begin with, the plaintiff never requested that the court do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.398" offset="784009">But in a broader sense, it's not the proper thing to do because there's a very big difference in conciliation after notification and before a lawsuit has been filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.474" offset="832283">There is... the emphasis is on let's get this conciliated, if possible.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="171.212" stopTime="212.722">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="171.212" offset="855271">But you said the same complaint could be filed at the end of the conciliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.597" offset="872825">What difference does it make that you have a piece of paper there?</text>
            <text syncTime="179.299" offset="887558">What I don't understand is the only effect of your position... dismiss the whole thing, 60 days, start over... is you're making the plaintiff file an additional filing fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.875" offset="937923">The complaint has already been filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.908" offset="946073">The filing fee has been paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.927" offset="954118">Now, everything would work out just the same except the plaintiff has to pay a second filing fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.047" offset="982540">In the court there are certain inefficiencies if it's first dismissed and then they have to docket it again.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.285" offset="1007513">So I don't see any... it doesn't seem to make any sense to me.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="connie_l_lensing" startTime="212.722" stopTime="227.062">
            <label>Ms. Connie L. Lensing</label>
            <text syncTime="212.722" offset="1021305">Well, Congress believed that notice and a chance to conciliate without a lawsuit was the proper way for this to be done, and there is a difference in efforts to conciliate before and after a lawsuit is filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.196" offset="1075222">And if--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="227.062" stopTime="259.932">
            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="227.062" offset="1078670">Well, I think... I think you're right about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.898" offset="1085985">I mean, once the lawyer's involved and they're in litigation and all that, they're not going to take conciliation efforts with the same light as before.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.654" offset="1117018">But the question is whether the remedy for that, which is some unfairness to you, is to throw the suit out or try to fix it as much as possible, such as through a stay or dismissing without prejudice or something.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.160" offset="1162994">Why should the Plaintiff... it's not his fault that the EEOC didn't notify you.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.862" offset="1181802">Why should he suffer the categorical sanction of dismissal simply because it's a little unfairness to you?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="connie_l_lensing" startTime="259.932" stopTime="282.131">
            <label>Ms. Connie L. Lensing</label>
            <text syncTime="259.932" offset="1210118">--I think it could be dismissed without prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.118" offset="1218896">I think that that's fine, because then you would have an opportunity, as in this case where there is a proper charge, to have that period of conciliation, and the plaintiff would not be out anything other than the filing fee, which the employer is out a little bit, too, because the employer never got a prompt notice at the time of the first situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.297" offset="1295591">But the biggest reason--</text>

            <text syncTime="282.131" offset="1298935">Why... why should the... the filing fee penalty, in effect, go to the plaintiff when it wasn't the plaintiff's fault?</text>

            <text syncTime="289.653" offset="1329028">--Well, you know, I would submit that perhaps it is the plaintiff's fault when the plaintiff does not do everything a plaintiff can to be sure that a charge is filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.824" offset="1361733">This particular form, for instance, stated that it is for... pre charge counseling is the purpose, and that it's to determine potential charges.</text>

            <text syncTime="323.722" offset="1465283">I mean, that... that seems to me a very strange argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.757" offset="1477403">You say since... since the EEOC must give notice when a charge is filed, if it doesn't give notice, no charge has been filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.801" offset="1533619">That doesn't make sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.803" offset="1541560">I mean, it's just like saying, you know, you have a civil rule, a rule of civil procedure, that says, you know, after a complaint has been filed there shall be an answer within 60 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.475" offset="1584296">And if no answer is filed, no complaint has been filed?</text>

            <text syncTime="390.434" offset="1732149">But there is a requirement under the statute that notice and an effort to conciliate be made before the suit is brought.</text>

            <text syncTime="1772.336" offset="7259764">The first major point is that the statute and the... well, this has been made sort of... the statute and the regulations state that, after a charge has been filed, the responsibility for sending the notice and docketing the case is upon the commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="3059.481" offset="12408290">Now, some members of the Court may recall that one of the problems that surfaced at the time of Edelman was that the agency, or at least some of the field offices of the agency, had a practice of not serving notice until after they received a verified Form 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.658" offset="12468998">And the February 21st memo was to say that needs to stop right now because our statutory obligations require us to serve notice within 10 days of the charge.</text>

            <text syncTime="3524.995" offset="14270403">The second thing we think, and it's been explored during the oral arguments so far, if the employer could allege or show some concrete prejudice as a result of not having received notice, then the district court should take that into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.237" offset="14327349">But in this case Federal Express has simply not alleged any concrete prejudice.</text>
