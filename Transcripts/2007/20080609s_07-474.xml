            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104693">I have our opinion this morning in case 04-474, Engquist versus Oregon Department of Agriculture.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.841" offset="140011">Anup Engquist, the petitioner in this case, had been an employee in the Oregon Department of Agriculture, since 1992.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.569" offset="170940">According to Engquist, one of her supervisors and one of her coworkers had been antagonistic toward her for several years and eventually got her fired. She brought suit in Federal District Court alleging among other things two sorts of violations of the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.302" offset="241888">First, she argued that she had been discriminated against because of her race, sex and national origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.176" offset="269369">In other words, because of her membership in particular classes.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.962" offset="288491">Second, she brought what has been called a class of one, equal protection challenge alleging that she was fired not because she was a member of an identifiable class, like her race, sex, and national origin claim, but simply for arbitrary, vindictive, and malicious reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.078" offset="364977">The District Court allowed both types of claims to proceed to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.047" offset="384830">The jury rejected Engquist's class based equal protection claims, but found for her on the class of one claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.564" offset="418894">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed in relevant part.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.720" offset="435508">The Court recognized that this Court had upheld a class of one equal protection challenge to state regulatory action in a case called Village of Willowbrook versus Olech.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.136" offset="485140">But the Ninth Circuit also recognized that we have traditionally afforded the government greater leeway when it acts as employer, as it was in this case, than when it acts as regulator as it was doing in the Olech case.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.642" offset="543237">The Ninth Circuit concluded that extending the class of one theory to public -- and through the public employment context would lead among other things to undo judicial interference in state employment practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.034" offset="596735">We agree, the main concern of the Equal Protection Clause is government classification of its citizens into groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.306" offset="633829">Thus, the Equal Protection Clause plainly protects public employees from adverse actions taken on the basis of the employees, membership in some identifiable class; the race, gender or national origin, and nothing in today's decision alters that.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.479" offset="706554">But government employment decisions by their nature involve discretionary decision making based on a vast array of subjective individualized assessments.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.205" offset="749500">In this context, it may often appear that similarly situated employees are treated differently. But it is not a proper challenge to what in its nature is a subjective individualized assessment that it is subjective and individualized.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.113" offset="821075">What is more?</text>
            <text syncTime="179.853" offset="824105">We have always been guided in these types of cases by, as we put it in another case, the “common sense realization that government could not function if every employment decision became a constitutional matter.”</text>
            <text syncTime="195.983" offset="888575">Accepting Engquist's position would allow every grievance by a public employee to become a constitutional challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.500" offset="922639">We do not believe the Equal Protection Clause requires that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.950" offset="944477">An employee claiming that she was treated differently because of her sex, race or national origin has a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.537" offset="978750">An employee who just claims she was treated differently does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.358" offset="998081">For these, and other reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.383" offset="1018143">Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Souter and Ginsburg have joined.</text>
