            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104920">Justice Ginsburg has the opinion for the Court this morning in case 06-6330, Kimbrough versus United States.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="10.559" offset="147134">In prescribing sentences for cocaine trafficking offenses, the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines set 100-to-1 powder/crack ratio.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.677" offset="199588">Thus, a dealer in crack cocaine was subject to the same sentence range as a dealer in a 100 times more powder cocaine.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.705" offset="239712">Our 2005 decision in Booker v. United States rendered the once mandatory guidelines effectively advisory and adopted a reasonableness standard for appellate review of District Court sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.484" offset="302824">We decide today whether that appellate review standard can be met when a district judge imposes a sentence reflecting her disagreement with the 100-to-1 powder/crack ratio as implemented in the Guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.622" offset="371369">Derrick Kimbrough, defendant below, petitioner here, pleaded guilty to trafficking in crack cocaine based on the 100-to-1, the Guidelines called for a sentence between 228 and 270 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.789" offset="431973">The District Court however determined that a sentence within that range would be greater than necessary to accomplish the basic objectives of sentencing Congress stated in 18 U.S.C. 3553(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="97.819" offset="496130">The statutory minimum sentence of 180 months, the District Court concluded, sufficed to satisfy the sentencing objectives Congress specified.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.995" offset="540851">On the Government's appeal, the Fourth Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.105" offset="557256">A sentence outside the Guidelines range is per se unreasonable, the Court of Appeals held when it is based as Kimbrough sentence in part was on the district court’s disagreement with the sentencing disparity for crack and powder cocaine offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.847" offset="636251">We reverse the Court of Appeals judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.037" offset="648998">Under Booker, all guidelines are advisory only.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.665" offset="667493">The Fourth Circuit erred in treating the cocaine guidelines as effectively mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.289" offset="694033">The crack/powder disparity originated in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 which imposed minimum sentences for drug trafficking crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.011" offset="744920">Congress apparently believed that crack cocaine was significantly more dangerous than powder cocaine and thus treated every gram of crack as equivalent of 100 grams of powder.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.912" offset="796538">In setting Guidelines ranges for cocaine offenses, the Sentencing Commission did not follow its usual empirical approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.602" offset="831229">Instead, it simply used the statutory 100-to-1 ratio.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.651" offset="851500">Later research and experience however led the Commission to report that a crack/powder disparity so large, rests on erroneous assumptions about the relative dangerousness of the two forms of the drug.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.048" offset="909073">The Government primarily contends that the Guidelines implementing the 100-to-1 ratio are an exception to the post Booker advisory only character of the Guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.322" offset="958184">Congress’ use of the 100-to-1 ratio in the 1986 Act, the Government urges, effectively bars sentencing courts from failing to adhere in all respects to that ratio.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.153" offset="1013459">We disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.828" offset="1020146">As explained in today's opinion, the 1986 Act mandates only maximum and minimum sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.679" offset="1051598">It says nothing about appropriate sentences within those statutory ranges.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.542" offset="1083049">The District Judge in this case determined that the statutory minimum of 15 years, not the Guidelines bottom of 19-and-a-half years was the appropriate prison term for Kimbrough.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.309" offset="1138115">In so ruling, the District Court both homed in on the particular circumstances of Kimbrough's case and accorded weight to the Sentencing Commission's reports showing that the crack/powder disparity yields unjustifiably harsh sentences for crack offenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.151" offset="1213452">Giving due respect to the District Court's reasoned appraisal of reviewing court could not rationally conclude that it was an abuse of discretion for the District Court to impose in this case a sentence four and a half years below the bottom sentence indicated by the Guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.464" offset="1298716">Justice Scalia has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.546" offset="1311046">Justices Thomas and Alito have filed dissenting opinions.</text>
