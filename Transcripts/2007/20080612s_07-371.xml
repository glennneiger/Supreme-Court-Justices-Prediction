            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="7.177" offset="133385">A basic tenet of our system of justice is that anyone who states a claim on which relief can be granted is entitled to his or her own day in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.861" offset="188138">Therefore, a judgment in a lawsuit generally does not bind the person without a party to the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.069" offset="220948">The question presented in this case, is there a virtual representation exception to this general rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.692" offset="259504">Petitioner Brent Taylor filed suit under the freedom of Information Act, seeking certain documents from the Federal Aviation Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.771" offset="303808">Greg Herrick(ph) Taylor's friend had previously brought an unsuccessful suit seeking the same records.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.156" offset="341320">The two men have no formal legal relationship and there was no evidence that Taylor controlled finance, participated in or even knew about Herrick's earlier suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.124" offset="397222">Nonetheless, the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit found that Taylor's suit was precluded by the judgment against Herrick.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.642" offset="439227">In the Court of Appeals' view, Herrick had virtually represented Taylor in the prior adjudications.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.110" offset="469111">Under the multifactor test announced by the D.C. Circuit, Herrick qualified as Taylor's virtual representative because Herrick's incentive to litigate was at least as strong as Taylor's.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.907" offset="532327">The two men sought release of the same documents were close associates and hired the same lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.602" offset="567122">We disapproved the doctrine of preclusion by a virtual representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.098" offset="589065">And therefore, vacate the D.C. Circuit's judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.373" offset="606202">As our decision is confirmed, there are several exceptions to the rule against non-party preclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.465" offset="638593">But the doctrine of virtual representation adopted by the D.C. Circuit is broader and cloudier than any of the exceptions we have approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.751" offset="687704">Our opinion explains why we find the doctrine an unwarranted departure from the general rule that every person is entitled to his or her own day in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.112" offset="741202">It was a result reached by the D.C. Circuit nevertheless justifiable under one of the established grounds for nonparty preclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.584" offset="779028">Most of those grounds have no application here, but one might cover this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.383" offset="810270">Preclusion would be appropriate if Taylor, in pursuing his own suit, is acting not independently, but as Herrick's agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.466" offset="862619">We remand to give the courts below an opportunity to address that yet unresolved issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.137" offset="901281">The Court's opinion is unanimous.</text>
