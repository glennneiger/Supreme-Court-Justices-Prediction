            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104620">Justice Souter has the opinion in case 06-571, Watson versus United States, which he asked me to announce.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.047" offset="140773">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.972" offset="164493">Petitioner, Michael A. Watson traded narcotics for a pistol and was indicted for using a pistol during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime in violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 924(c)(1)(A).</text>
            <text syncTime="30.801" offset="227813">He pleaded guilty, but reserved the right to appeal on the ground that receiving a firearm in exchange for narcotics is not use of a firearm within the meaning of Section 924 (c)(1)(A).</text>
            <text syncTime="44.271" offset="281626">The Court of Appeals rejected this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.308" offset="293851">In an opinion filed with the clerk of the Court, we hold that Watson's conduct does not constitute use of a firearm, we reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.455" offset="330422">We have construed the same provision twice before.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.824" offset="343902">Both times, we relied primarily on the ordinary or natural meaning of the verb "in context".</text>
            <text syncTime="66.762" offset="371591">This appeal to ordinary English leaves the Government without much of a case for -- for in regular speech, we would not say that Watson used a firearm by merely receiving it in a barter transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.579" offset="422896">The Government's two main arguments for trumping ordinary English are unavailing.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.305" offset="441809">First, the Government argues that under a neighboring provision, Section 924(d)(1), the verb used is employed in a manner that includes receipt in barter.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.194" offset="485381">It asks us to import this meaning into Section (c)(1)(A), but this argument over reads our precedence and forgets that in the two different subsections, the common verb speaks to different issues in different voices and at different levels of specificity.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.932" offset="556329">Second, the Government warns that a decision in favor of Watson would create unacceptable asymmetry with Smith versus United States, a prior case in which we held that trading of firearm for narcotics does constitute use of the firearm.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.606" offset="622994">Whatever the tension between the -- that result in the outcome here, law depends on respect for language and would be served better by statutory amendment if Congress sees asymmetry, then by racking statutory language to cover a policy it fails to fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.894" offset="692166">Justice Ginsburg has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
