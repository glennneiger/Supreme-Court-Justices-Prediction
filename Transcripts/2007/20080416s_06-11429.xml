            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104899">Petitioner Keith Burgess pleaded guilty to a federal drug offense that ordinarily carries a 10-year mandatory minimum sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.141" offset="153382">That minimum doubles to 20 years for defendants previously convicted of a felony drug offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.955" offset="188700">The question in this case is whether Burgess' prior South Carolina conviction for cocaine possession punishable by more than one year's imprisonment but classified by state law as a misdemeanor ranks as a felony drug offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.112" offset="265291">Two statutory definitions figure in our decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.362" offset="282323">The first defines the unadorned term felony to mean, any offense classified by applicable federal or state law as a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.748" offset="327880">The second defines the term felony drug offense to mean a drug offense punishable by imprisonment for more than one year under any law of the United States or of the State or foreign country.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.824" offset="388171">Burgess argues that a crime counts as a felony drug offense only if it qualifies under both definitions that is, the offense, he urges, must be both classified as a felony under the law of the punishing jurisdiction and punishable by more than one year in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.983" offset="484824">The government in contrast reads the definition of the term “felony drug offense” as the exclusive reference.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.726" offset="519723">Defendants convicted of drug felonies in violation of federal law whose prior drug crimes were punishable by more than one year in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.023" offset="560892">The government urges must receive a 20-year minimum sentence regardless of the punishing jurisdictions classification of the prior offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.946" offset="608644">The District Court agreed with the government as did the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.016" offset="632886">We granted review to resolve a circuit split, and now affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.257" offset="657859">For purposes of the federal sentencing enhancement we hold, the definition of the compound term “felony drug offense,” and only that definition counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.105" offset="705297">Among our reasons, Congress used the words, “felony drug offense” as a term of art.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.378" offset="734346">A definition stating what a term means as the definition of felony drug offense does, generally excludes any unstated meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.230" offset="777813">Furthermore, in law books, the word felony is commonly defined to mean a crime punishable by more than one year in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.877" offset="816370">Defining felony drug offense just that way as Congress did, leaves no blank for a discrete statutory definition of felony to fill.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.128" offset="869346">Our reading avoids anomalies that would arise if two different definitions governed the application of the 20-year federal minimum sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.566" offset="907067">The statutory definition of felony includes state and federal offenses but does not include foreign offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.811" offset="936115">Congress' definition of felony drug offense however, expressly includes foreign offenses, holding that both definitions apply moreover, would leave unanswered the appropriate classification of drug convictions in jurisdictions that do not label offenses as felonies or misdemeanors.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.409" offset="1026499">Our construction of the statute hardly renders the separate definition of felony extraneous, that definition is controlling for the many statutory provisions that use the word felony unmodified.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.374" offset="1086372">The statute's drafting history reinforces our reading of the legislative text.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.116" offset="1105284">In 1994, Congress amended the definition of felony drug offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.473" offset="1126705">It replaced the words “offense that is a felony under any law of the State,” with the words "offense that is punishable by imprisonment for more than one year under any law of a State."</text>
            <text syncTime="270.826" offset="1188145">An evident purpose of the 1994 revision was to eliminate disparities resulting from divergent state classifications of offenses by adopting a uniform federal standard based solely on the authorized length of imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.720" offset="1259720">Finally, Burgess urges us to decide the case in his favor based on the rule of lenity, the touchstone of that rule is statutory ambiguity because Congress expressly defined felony drug offense in the manner coherent, complete, and by all signs exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.372" offset="1338297">There is no ambiguity for the rule of lenity to resolve.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.391" offset="1358463">The Court's opinion is unanimous.</text>
