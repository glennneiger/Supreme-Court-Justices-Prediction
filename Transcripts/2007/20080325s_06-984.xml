            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104869">I have the opinion of the Court in Case 06-984, Medellin versus Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.940" offset="132559">The United States is a party to a treaty known as the Vienna Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.520" offset="150949">That treaty provides that if a foreign citizen is arrested, he has the right to get help from the representative of his home country and to be told of that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.407" offset="190446">In this case, petitioner Medellin was arrested in Texas in connection with the brutal gang rape and murder of two girls aged 14 and 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.871" offset="228271">He had lived in the United States since preschool, but was a citizen of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.175" offset="249483">Upon arrest, Medillin was advised of his Miranda rights, waived them in writing and gave a detailed confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.365" offset="278322">He was not, however, advised of his rights under the Vienna Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.943" offset="296608">Medillin was convicted and sentenced to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.971" offset="308729">After his conviction became final, Medillin argued that it should be set aside because of the Vienna Convention violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.817" offset="340076">The state courts rejected that argument on the ground that it had not been raised in a timely manner under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.677" offset="371527">Meanwhile, the government of Mexico brought a complaint on behalf of Medillin and 50 other similarly situated Mexican citizens seeking relief for the violation of their Vienna Convention rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.096" offset="421160">Mexico brought this complaint against the United States in the International Court of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.503" offset="442789">The International Court of Justice, or ICJ, is an international tribunal located in The Hague that was established pursuant to the United Nations Charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.391" offset="486361">The ICJ found in favor of Mexico ruling that the United States should require a reconsideration of Medillin's Vienna Convention claim despite his failure to comply with state procedural rules governing such challenges.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.443" offset="546547">In the case of Sanchez-Llamas versus Oregon, decided in this Court less than two years ago, we confronted a claim by foreign nationals not included in the ICJ's judgment who similarly argued that the Vienna Convention required that state law be set aside in their cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.108" offset="621258">We rejected that claim, disagreeing with the ICJ's interpretation of the Vienna Convention, holding instead that the Convention does not trump state procedural rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.534" offset="666920">Now, following the ICJ's decision and notwithstanding our decision in Sanchez-Llamas, Medillin filed another application for relief in Texas state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.147" offset="709447">He argued that because the United States agreed to the jurisdiction of the ICJ when it signed the Vienna Convention, the ICJ judgment was itself automatically federal law that required Texas to set aside its contrary state rules no matter what this Court had said in Sanchez-Llamas.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.965" offset="788650">The Texas courts rejected that claim we granted review.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.127" offset="809339">Going all the way back to an opinion by Chief Justice John Marshall, this Court has explained that there are two types of treaties.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.606" offset="839223">The President can negotiate and the Senate can ratify a treaty that on its terms specifies that its provisions can automatically become federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.035" offset="880915">Such a treaty is called self-executing and it does indeed trump contrary state and even federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.278" offset="909963">The other type is a treaty that is not self-executing and its provisions become federal law only if Congress passes and the President signs, implementing legislation, giving that effect to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.041" offset="965029">We conclude that the ICJ judgment did not automatically become federal law, overriding state law under the Supremacy Clause because the treaties pursuant to which the United States agreed to ICJ jurisdiction do not provide that ICJ judgments would be self-executing.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.338" offset="1038172">For example, the UN Charter says that member states will "undertake to comply" with ICJ judgments, which is different from saying they are automatically effective as domestic law.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.166" offset="1093447">The relevant treaties provide that ICJ judgments were to be enforced through the UN Security Council and the United States knew that it could always block enforcement if it disagreed with an ICJ judgment by exercising its Security Council veto.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.304" offset="1154051">That right would be taken away if ICJ judgments were automatically enforceable as federal law without more.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.023" offset="1188951">There are currently 47 nations that have submitted to ICJ jurisdiction in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.769" offset="1211938">Not one treats ICJ judgments as binding law in their courts as Medillin argues we should.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.456" offset="1242658">For these and other reasons set forth in our opinion, we hold that the ICJ decision does not require Texas to set aside its state law and reconsider Medillin's conviction, but there is more to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.155" offset="1301486">After the ICJ decision, the President sent a memorandum to the Attorney General stating that the United States would discharge its international obligations under the ICJ decision "by having state courts give effect to the decision."</text>
            <text syncTime="316.338" offset="1370136">Medillin argues that even if the ICJ judgment does not by itself require Texas to reconsider his Vienna Convention claim, the President's memorandum does.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.059" offset="1417052">The Solicitor General agrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.377" offset="1426351">We do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.031" offset="1432934">In this area, federal law that displaces state law can be created in one of two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.154" offset="1457385">First, Congress can pass a law that the President signs or whose veto is overridden, or second, the President can make and the Senate can ratify a self-executing treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.820" offset="1512138">You will notice that there's something about each of these options.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.644" offset="1527393">Each requires action by both the Executive and the Legislative Branches.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.919" offset="1548500">As a general manner, the framers did not trust one branch, acting alone, to create federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.734" offset="1575772">Here, the argument is that the President acting alone created federal law that displaces state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.164" offset="1605447">We do not accept that proposition under the circumstances before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.067" offset="1625091">Accordingly, neither the ICJ judgment nor the President's memorandum give rise -- gives rise to federal law that displaces the application of Texas state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.613" offset="1675246">The decision below is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.201" offset="1685591">Justice Stevens has written an opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.235" offset="1701787">Justice Breyer has written a dissenting opinion in which Justices Souter and Ginsburg joined.</text>
