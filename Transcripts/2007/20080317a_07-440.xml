            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="169932">We will now hear argument in Case 07-440, Rothgery v. Gillespie County, Texas.</text>

            <text syncTime="8.353" offset="203264">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In Brewer and Jackson, this Court held that an initial appearance before a magistrate like the one here marks the commencement of a criminal prosecution under the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.177" offset="266585">This case demonstrates why that holding makes eminent sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.753" offset="288841">Rothgery was arrested on the erroneous belief that he was a felon in possession of a firearm.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.609" offset="316322">As required by the Texas Code, he was brought before a magistrate, who informed him of the felony accusation against him and required him to post bail or remain in jail to ensure that he answered that accusation.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.788" offset="381001">At that point, Rothgery acquired specific rights under Texas law as the accused in a felony case, including the right to have the prosecution against him dismissed if an indictment or information were not filed within a set period and the right to contest the accusation against him prior to indictment in an examining trial before the magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.575" offset="484133">At that point, Rothgery was no longer merely a suspect, but an accused within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="87.930" offset="521645">Counsel, how can this... how can this be part of an adversary proceeding when there's no other adversary on the field?</text>
            <text syncTime="95.351" offset="551320">The prosecution's not present.</text>

            <text syncTime="108.234" offset="602833">Well, in Jackson of course the charges had already been filed by the prosecutor, so there was an adversary on the field.</text>

            <label>Ms. Danielle Spinelli</label>
            <text syncTime="114.403" offset="627493">--What I was going to say was that there is a clear distinction which is set forth in this Court's opinion in Jackson between the question whether a particular proceeding initiates a criminal prosecution and whether that proceeding itself is adversarial in the sense that it requires the presence of defense counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.315" offset="735117">And, as to the first question, whether a particular proceeding initiates a criminal prosecution, this Court's cases have not held that prosecutorial involvement is a relevant factor, and that--</text>

          <turn speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="158.371" stopTime="182.719">
            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="158.371" offset="803349">Well, I suppose... I suppose you could you have an adversarial proceeding without the prosecutor present, but it would depend on the nature of the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.321" offset="831143">And here the magistrate simply advises the individual of the charges against him, repeats the Miranda warnings, advises him that he can have counsel if bail is denied or if he can't make bail.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.299" offset="887045">What about that is adversarial?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="danielle_spinelli" startTime="182.719" stopTime="235.054">
            <label>Ms. Danielle Spinelli</label>
            <text syncTime="182.719" offset="900734">--That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice, and we don't contend that it is adversarial.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.060" offset="918079">In Jackson, this Court made clear that a proceeding need not itself be adversarial in the sense that would require defense counsel to be present to counter the adversary presentation of the prosecutor in order for that proceeding to initiate a criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.585" offset="996237">Rather, it held that the initial appearance itself, regardless of those other factors, marked the commencement of a prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.377" offset="1035421">And it's worth noting that in Jackson substantially the same arguments that Respondent raises here were made by the State there.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.294" offset="1079098">The State there contended this initial appearance is merely an administrative ministerial proceeding.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="235.054" offset="1110131">Well, I guess I'll get back to the point I raised earlier, that in Jackson charges had already been filed by a prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.006" offset="1133955">The prosecutor was aware of this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.115" offset="1142314">I think that's a fairly significant distinction.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="danielle_spinelli" startTime="246.394" stopTime="296.795">
            <label>Ms. Danielle Spinelli</label>
            <text syncTime="246.394" offset="1155480">Well, the Court in Jackson placed no weight on that distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.767" offset="1176900">That wasn't something that was mentioned in Jackson.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.454" offset="1187663">And what happened in Jackson was that warrants were obtained, the defendants were arrested, and they were brought before a magistrate for this initial proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.087" offset="1242206">There is no indication that the prosecutor was present at that initial proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.086" offset="1262268">The Jackson court... the Jackson court put no weight on that factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.476" offset="1283793">And none of this Court's cases have ever stated that there is a requirement that a prosecutor be involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.441" offset="1311692">And that makes sense, because the consequences of the initial appearance for the defendant are precisely the same whether or not a prosecutor is involved.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="296.795" offset="1357041">But what we're looking for here, at least one of the things we might look for in this case, is a specific rule to give to the States so the State knows when counsel has to be appointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.291" offset="1403016">In this case suppose the magistrate, the man behind the little window, said: We're going to give you a ticket; keep in touch with us; don't change your address until you notify us; you're free on your own recognizance.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.083" offset="1450245">Would counsel have been required there?</text>

            <text syncTime="321.940" offset="1457664">Had there been no way in which the defendant was bound to reappear and answer the charges, then we would not have the situation that we have, and it would seem less likely that that would initiate a criminal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.465" offset="1539689">The factors that we have here that make it clear that a prosecution was initiated, just as it was in Jackson on identical facts--</text>

            <text syncTime="351.275" offset="1575006">Ms. Spinelli, there's something confusing about your presentation of this, because you say that at this initial appearance that's called a magistration, you are not contending that there was a right to counsel at that very proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="384.947" offset="1709694">Well, first I should say I believe that that question goes to Respondent's alternative argument for affirmance.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.146" offset="1738428">The only question that was addressed by the Fifth Circuit and the only question presented in the petition was the question whether a criminal prosecution commenced at Rothgery's magistration.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.095" offset="1794226">And we are certainly not asking this Court to direct the entry of judgment in our favor, but merely--</text>

            <text syncTime="3568.415" offset="14443552">It's correct that Gerstein says that the probable-cause determination made under Gerstein is not, itself, a critical stage, and we are not contending otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.538" offset="14483989">The Gerstein determination is something separate from the initial appearance that occurred here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.799" offset="14509067">A Gerstein determination is made for the purpose of determining whether there was probable cause for an arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.282" offset="14531010">It can be made ex parte.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.076" offset="14538219">It's essentially the equivalent of what happens prior to arrest when a magistrate decides whether there is probable cause to issue a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.510" offset="14575940">What happened here, by contrast, was after arrest and after the police had decided to... Mr. Rothgery, he was brought before a magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.070" offset="14626200">He was officially informed of the accusation against him, and at that time he acquired the right to contest the accusation against him in an examining trial, which we believe shows that he was accused within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment, and a prosecution had begun.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.967" offset="14701746">And we are not contending that that initial proceeding was, itself, a critical stage where counsel was required; and it's not necessary to contend that in order to prevail on the point that that was when a prosecution commenced, which is the only question that we believe is properly before this Court and the only one we are asking it to resolve.</text>

            <text syncTime="3687.571" offset="14920130">I don't believe that that's the case because, as Justice Breyer observed, 45 jurisdictions already follow the rule of appointing counsel at, or immediately following, the initial appearance, which the... any CDL brief lays out and which neither Respondent nor its State amici have contested.</text>

            <text syncTime="3736.737" offset="15116779">This is the accusation against you, and these are your rights as a defendant in a criminal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3743.001" offset="15141857">And for that reason, as the Armstrong decision says, it is commonly recognized across jurisdictions as the inception of a formal prosecution, and we believe that's the rule that this Court has already laid out in Brewer and Jackson and should reaffirm today.</text>

            <text syncTime="3765.757" offset="15232868">I mean, just to respond to one other question that arose during the course of Respondent's argument, I think it is important to understand that in Texas, as in other jurisdictions, there are two phases in a felony prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3784.639" offset="15308414">There is an initial phase that commences in a magistrate court where a document setting out the charges will be filed either by the police or by a prosecutor, and the magistrate at that point has jurisdiction over that criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3800.478" offset="15371839">It is only later that an indictment or information will be filed in the general trial court with jurisdiction to enter final judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3809.912" offset="15409560">But this Court has repeatedly rejected the notion that a prosecution begins only in that second phase.</text>
            <text syncTime="3818.143" offset="15442474">It rejected it expressly in Moore.</text>
            <text syncTime="3820.393" offset="15451460">It rejected it in Coleman, in Brewer, in Jackson, and in statements in Kirby and McNeil.</text>
