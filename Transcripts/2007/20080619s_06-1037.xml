            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104692">Well now, the second one, Kentucky Retirement Systems v. EEOC is more complicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.767" offset="131755">It involves a very complicated retirement pension system that Kentucky has so I'll simplify it for discussion and if you want the whole complication, you have to read the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.400" offset="174282">The system permits, but it doesn't require, certain workers like policemen to retire at age 55 and get a pension.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.242" offset="221616">Now, for a worker who becomes seriously disabled before he be 60 – before he becomes 55, he gets a pension too because Kentucky does that by pretending that the worker had worked till the age of 55.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.488" offset="290579">So he gives the -- they give the worker credit for years of work that he didn't actually work and I call those phantom years.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.258" offset="321717">And if you're disabled before you're 55, you get these phantom years to bring you up to the age 55 and then they figure out what the pension would have been if he'd really done it.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.839" offset="364036">Well in this case, a worker became seriously disabled after he was 55 and eligible for a pension.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.324" offset="393920">And he complains that Kentucky system amounts to age discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.228" offset="413564">He points out that Kentucky would give 55 -- give phantom years to a worker who became disabled before he reach 55, "but what about me?"</text>
            <text syncTime="87.259" offset="453688">He says, "I – I reached 55 and then I became disabled so I don't get any phantom years.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.386" offset="478139">That's seems like age discrimination just based on the fact that whether you are older or younger than 55."</text>
            <text syncTime="101.553" offset="510844">Now, the Court of Appeals agreed with that, but we don't agree with that, we reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.355" offset="530070">“We agree that Kentucky treated the two workers differently, but we don't think that difference amounts to discrimination because of age."</text>
            <text syncTime="114.606" offset="563089">Those are the words of the ADEA, that's what the ADEA forbids, discrimination because of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.675" offset="587330">"Rather, we think what's going on is that Kentucky is simply trying to give a pension to workers who became disabled before they reached retirement age."</text>
            <text syncTime="129.892" offset="624215">Kentucky gives the phantom years to those workers because otherwise they couldn't qualify for a pension.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.092" offset="648979">Kentucky doesn't give phantom years to workers who became disabled after they reach say 55 because those workers already have qualified for a pension.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.146" offset="685237">They don't need any phantom years to become qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.614" offset="699134">So, age is certainly a factor that ordinarily qualifies workers for a pension, but it is pension status, "Are you, Mister Disabled Worker, already qualified for a pension or not already qualified for a pension?"</text>
            <text syncTime="163.123" offset="757126">That's what matters for purposes of determining whether phantom years are added.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.288" offset="777815">That is what explains the difference in treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.103" offset="789100">So, age is in a sense an artifact of the pension eligibility rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.129" offset="809162">It is not the reason or even a reason for the discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.895" offset="828179">So, we conclude Kentucky systems does not embody the sort of discrimination that Congress sought to eliminate in the ADEA, and so it doesn't fall within the statute's prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.305" offset="869871">Now, we have been pretty careful to limit our holding to this quite special case of differential treatment based on pension status, and pension status is a circumstance that the ADEA and the Social Security law too both treat as special, specifically authorizing age-related rules that in other areas they might bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.449" offset="954403">Now, we also list in a number of other features, quite a few features of this case that make it special for age discrimination purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.170" offset="985332">The upshot is that where an employer treats employees differently based on their pension status and even if the pension status does depend on age, the plaintiff still has to show that that age made a difference rather than just a pension status, that it was actually motivated this discrimination or there's a reason for it that was based upon age and not pension status.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.772" offset="1091703">Now, we explain this -- it's more complex even than I've suggested and we explained it all in our decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.061" offset="1120855">Justice Kennedy has filed a dissenting opinion with which Justices Scalia, Ginsburg, and Alito have joined.</text>
