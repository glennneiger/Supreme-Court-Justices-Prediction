            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104829">Remarkably enough, we have two tax opinions to announce today.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.113" offset="129280">The first is by Justice Alito.</text>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="11.874" offset="152267">This is Meadwestvaco Corporation versus Illinois Department of Revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.892" offset="172329">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the Appellate Court of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.138" offset="189361">The petitioner is a successor in interest to the Mead Corporation, an Ohio Corporation, engaged in the production and sale of paper goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.144" offset="229381">The respondent is the Illinois Department of Revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.935" offset="240561">We have been asked to decide whether a tax levied by Illinois on an apportioned share of the capital gain that Mead realized in 1994, violates the Commerce and Due Process Clauses of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.626" offset="303255">In 1994, Mead realized the capital gain on the sale of one of its divisions, the online research service Lexis/Nexis.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.921" offset="340453">The State of Illinois took the position that an apportioned share of this gain was taxable in Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.031" offset="364904">Mead paid the tax under protest and filed this suit in state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.682" offset="383503">The trial court found that Lexis/Nexis was not part of the unitary business that Mead conducted in Illinois, but that the State could nevertheless tax an apportioned share of the gain because Lexis/Nexis serves an operational function in that business.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.840" offset="448182">The Appellate Court of Illinois affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.816" offset="456019">It agreed that Lexis served an operational function in Meadâ€™s business and did not reach the question whether Lexis and Mead formed a unitary business.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.174" offset="497502">As we explain at greater length in the opinion filed today with the clerk of the Court, the concept of operational function simply identifies one way in which an asset can form part of the tax payer's unitary business.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.780" offset="547866">The operational function test, as the state courts termed it, was not intended to supplement the unitary business principle with a separate ground for apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.300" offset="589975">Once the Court determines that two businesses are not unitary, the constitutional inquiry is generally at an end.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.869" offset="620277">The trial court here found that Lexis and Mead were not unitary, but the Appellate Court of Illinois, relying on its operational function analysis, made no such determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.255" offset="661760">It is free to consider that question on remand and we express no opinion on it now.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.244" offset="681717">The judgment of the Appellate Court of Illinois is vacated and this matter is remanded to that Court for further proceedings, not inconsistent with our opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.272" offset="721841">The judgment of the Court is unanimous.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.838" offset="728111">Justice Thomas has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
