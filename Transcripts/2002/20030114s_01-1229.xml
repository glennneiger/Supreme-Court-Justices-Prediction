            <text syncTime="9.118" offset="121659">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.926" offset="144856">23 U.S.C. Section 409 provides that materials compiled or collected for the purpose of certain road safety programs shall not be subject to the discovery or admitted into evidence in a Federal or State Court proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.235" offset="226044">As initially adopted Section 409 protected it from disclosure only materials compiled for the prescribed purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.335" offset="270452">The phrase or collectibles added to the statute in 1995.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.980" offset="321025">Respondents's wife died in a car accident at an intersection in Pierce County, Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.014" offset="345163">When respondent sought to obtain from petitioner documents about that intersection's accident history, petitioner claims such information was protected by Section 409.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.899" offset="396781">The Washington Supreme Court disagreed finding that the 1995 amendment to Section 409 exceeded Congress' authority under the Spending, Commerce and Necessary and Proper Clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.217" offset="449966">In an opinion filed with the Clerk, we dismiss the writ of certiorari with respect to one portion of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.819" offset="480372">With respect to the remainder, we reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Washington and remand for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.714" offset="512033">In light of the canon that evidentiary privileges must be construed narrowly, we conclude that Section 409 protects from disclosure only information compiled or collected for the purposes of the relevant road safety program.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.043" offset="577339">Information compiled or collected for purposes unrelated to the program and held by the agency that are regionally compiled or collected the information is not protected by Section 409.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.936" offset="632928">This is so even if that information was at some point collected by another agency for purposes of the safety program.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.873" offset="668663">As so construed, Section 409 and its 1995 Amendment fall within Congress's authority to regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce and to regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.174" offset="729790">The opinion of the Court is unanimous.</text>
