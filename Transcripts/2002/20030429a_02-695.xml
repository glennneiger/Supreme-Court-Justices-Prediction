            <text syncTime="59.524" offset="380188">The Iowa Legislature, consistent with the Equal Protection Clause, can charge different tax rates for its riverboats and its racetracks for a number of legitimate State interest reasons, including and especially the one highlighted by the district court judge here, the promotion of the development of river communities.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.033" offset="454271">In 1983, Iowa broke ground and got more friendly with gambling and allowed horse racing and dog racing in our State.</text>

            <text syncTime="90.528" offset="504217">I... is there a neutral term, Your Honor?</text>
            <text syncTime="94.433" offset="519891">In... in regard to gaming, one of the main purposes of having horse and dog racing was to develop a new subset of our agricultural economy, the breeding, training, and raising of horses and dogs.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.660" offset="584779">And that succeeded.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.910" offset="589794">It turned out to be about a $50 million industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.550" offset="600348">Six years later, with visions of Mark Twain in the background and the two incredible rivers in America surrounding our State, the Mississippi and the Missouri, the legislature authorized riverboat casinos, riverboat gambling.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.917" offset="661788">And one of the main purposes there was tourism, economic development for the river communities and riverfront development.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.742" offset="697105">In a very short time, there were $17 million worth of investment along the various riverfronts.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.568" offset="720407">A few years later, though, neither gaming enterprise was... was doing as well as they would like, indeed, not doing... not doing well at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.940" offset="757918">In regard to the riverboats, the problem was, well, Iowa had this sort of, in a way, naivete maybe about betting.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.187" offset="786862">They restricted the amount of bets on riverboats.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.857" offset="801491">It could only be a $5 bet and one couldn't lose more than... more than $200 in one setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.151" offset="822702">Well, Illinois had a different view and had no limits and were starting to succeed competitively.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.211" offset="846944">The... the situation with the racetracks was more severe, that economically it just wouldn't work to have racing, either horse racing or dog racing alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.629" offset="892606">So Iowa became the first State in the Nation to allow the sort of the... the golden goose of gambling, slot machines, at racetracks.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="197.079" offset="930431">So now the bulk of the earnings are from slot machines rather than the races.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="212.292" offset="991244">But under your scheme, I take it the highest tax rate for slot machine income at racetracks is 36 percent versus 20 percent for slot machines on riverboats.</text>

            <text syncTime="230.410" offset="1063760">And that was provided on a... on a graduated basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.767" offset="1081210">Actually in next year it's... the 36 percent would be... would be reached.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <text syncTime="243.342" offset="1115482">And what... what we say is that the development of the... of the riverboats could be rationally preferred by the... by the legislature because of riverboat development, because of economic development on the... on the rivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.132" offset="1182669">Additionally, the... the district court found that the additional rational basis could be sort of supporting the riverboat enterprises as a... as an industry, promoting riverboat history.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.533" offset="1232198">Also, we argue that there was a problem of riverboats leaving the State, that three out of six in the previous... previous to 1994, the legislation year, had... had left the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="302.349" offset="1351525">Obviously, a State very often would... would tax at a different rate a handsaw and a screwdriver, but we've never heard of a State that said when you sell a screwdriver, you pay 5 percent tax if you sell it in Des Moines and a 3 percent tax if you sell it in Dubuque, and if it's sold by one kind of a person, they sell 8 percent tax, and it's all the same screwdriver.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.809" offset="1445357">So they're saying there's never been a... really a tax system like this anywhere, and... and they better have some pretty good reason or... or something.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.274" offset="1479211">I mean, now... so is all that true, that there never has been a system like that, saying the same screwdriver, everything identical, all it is is it's sold in different parts of the State or by different people, and... and you have to pay a different tax?</text>

            <text syncTime="1055.152" offset="4362712">Taxing decisions are like spending decisions because they affect the State's economy, as well as its balance sheet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.883" offset="4397611">In recognizing that fact, this Court has consistently upheld the... the... has consistently held that a State's desire to promote or foster one type of business over another or even to promote or foster one mode of doing a business over another is a rational basis that supports taxing the one and exempting the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.060" offset="4494369">For example, in State Board v. Jackson in 1931, this Court held... upheld a tax differential, a different tax treatment, of chain stores versus single enterprise retail stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.086" offset="4550480">Even though these businesses did essentially the same commerce, the Court held that in the State's exercise of its broad authority to govern the economy of the State, it can prefer one mode of doing the same business over another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.957" offset="4609935">And that same rationale has been applied by this Court in numerous contexts involving tax distinctions between, for example, warehouses located near railroads and warehouses not located near railroads, between laundries that are operated by hand and laundries that are operated by machine, and even between individuals and corporations that are conducting identical businesses.</text>

            <text syncTime="1681.150" offset="6866705">I think the Iowa Supreme Court in this case, as this Court will determine as it reviews the opinion, addressed two questions, not merely one question, in this equal protection challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.000" offset="6938072">The first question the court addressed is what did the legislature have in mind in enacting this legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.716" offset="6972971">In doing so and in answering that question, the State court was doing what State courts routinely do, interpreting State law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3298.812" offset="13337340">We believe that this Court in reviewing past State court equal protection decisions and more recently in the... in the tax area in Williams against Vermont and Hooper against Bernalillo County has... has respected the... the determinations that have been made by the State courts as to what legislative intent was, as we ask the Court to do in this case, and in those cases, and applying... after that threshold determination, applying equal protection analysis, found the statutes under a rational basis analysis did not comport with equal protection.</text>

            <text syncTime="3360.192" offset="13582891">I would just point out that Minnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery Company is the... is the case where this Court decided that in... in a case before this Court that comes from a State court, that the Federal process, the Federal analysis applies, and that the total work, the total decisionmaking done by the State court is reviewable here, so much so that in that case they reversed a factual finding in... in the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.913" offset="13709742">I would emphasize too that... that the Iowa Supreme Court has said that... that the analysis is... is... always is the same between the State provision and... and the Federal provision, and it's only departed, as a matter of result, only one time, the Bierkamp case, in the 130 years that the two provisions existed at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.562" offset="13800335">With that, I would respond to any questions that you might have or... or conclude by asking you to uphold the constitutionality of this... of this act because there are multiple legitimate State interests developed by rational speculation to support the legislation.</text>
