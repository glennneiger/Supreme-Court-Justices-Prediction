            <label>Mr. Roy T. Englert, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="75.945" offset="444208">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="79.605" offset="458836">This is a case of inventive statutory interpretation by the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.719" offset="479316">The statute at issue directs the courts how to construe this act or any other provision of law, yet the Ninth Circuit interpreted the statute rather inventively as an exemption from a provision of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.192" offset="529158">The statute protects California statutes and regulations regarding two aspects of California's composition regulation of packaged fluid milk, yet the Ninth Circuit interpreted the statute, rather inventively, as an exemption for all aspects of California's economic regulation of raw milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.500" offset="610451">Inventiveness may have a role to play in some cases of statutory interpretation, but not when the governing legal standard requires that Congress has made its intent unmistakably clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.098" offset="660815">The Ninth Circuit's statutory holding should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.603" offset="674817">There is also a constitutional issue before the Court involving the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.884" offset="699894">The Ninth Circuit should be reversed on that issue as well, but not because it was overly inventive.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.896" offset="724032">The Ninth Circuit simply ignored, with no explanation at all, binding precedent from this Court requiring that courts look beyond the face of the statute to determine whether, in practical effect, it draws a distinction based on citizenship or residency.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.870" offset="791845">The California statutes and regulations at issue in this case draw a distinction based on where milk is produced, and 93 percent of dairy farmers live on their farms.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.827" offset="839702">To draw a distinction based on the State of production is, in effect, to draw a distinction based on the State of residency, and the distinction should be subject to scrutiny under the Privileges and Immunities Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.858" offset="887872">We do not--</text>

            <label>Mr. Roy T. Englert, Jr.</label>

            <text syncTime="209.619" offset="978882">Let me return to the statutory issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.206" offset="997272">This act or any other provision of law in section 144 means statutory or regulatory law, not the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.362" offset="1029873">Why do I say that?</text>
            <text syncTime="223.949" offset="1036247">Number 1, section 144 is phrased as a directive to courts about how to construe particular bodies of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.462" offset="1066236">Congress doesn't have the power to tell courts how to construe the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.122" offset="1084939">It does have the power to tell courts how to construe congressional silence or inaction, and the McCarran-Ferguson Act is a good example of the kind of phraseology Congress uses when it wants to enact a Commerce Clause exemption, but section 144 is a poor candidate from the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.773" offset="1151499">Number 2, the canons of construction applied in numerous decisions of this Court, most recently the Keffler case in February, required that a general phrase like, other provision of law, be construed by reference to the phrases that came before.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.672" offset="1215134">Federal statutory and regulatory law is naturally paired with this act, but would be very odd to throw the Constitution in as an afterthought through use of the phrase, other provision of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.776" offset="1259542">Number 3, the legislative history is devastating to respondents' position.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.538" offset="1278559">The absence of a single reference to the Constitution anywhere in the legislative history is quite significant, but it's not the strongest refutation of respondents' argument in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.871" offset="1323907">Rather, the very first paragraph of explanation of section 144 in the conference report describes it as, quote, an exemption from the preemption provisions of any Federal law respecting standards of identity and labeling for fluid milk, close quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.640" offset="1386915">That can be found on page 33 of the blue brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.115" offset="1396841">Number 4, and this is merely the clincher that builds on the first three points, the standard is whether Congress has been unmistakably clear in passing a Commerce Clause exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.157" offset="1437070">The evidence is so strongly the other way that one might call it unmistakably clear that Congress did not pass a Commerce Clause exemption, but it--</text>

            <text syncTime="333.534" offset="1474582">This argument's probably better addressed to the respondents than... than you, but do you understand the respondents to argue that the percentage of... of milk solids which is one, and labeling, which is the second part of the statute, simply will cease to exist if... if this pricing regulation is not upheld?</text>

            <text syncTime="368.618" offset="1614912">I think the strongest form their argument takes is, there is a relationship between economic regulation of raw milk and compositional regulation of packaged fluid milk, and any relationship is enough to satisfy this statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="617.295" offset="2609550">Section 144 does not indicate with unmistakable clarity that Congress meant to exempt from the Commerce Clause any California laws, much less to exempt the particular raw milk pooling regulations at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.356" offset="2665870">Indeed, section 144 is most naturally read as protecting only a narrow set of California's fluid milk composition and labeling laws from invalidation only under Federal statutes and regulations, not under the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.247" offset="2725429">First, Congress did not state or even imply that the Commerce Clause is among the provisions of law from which section 144 provides protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.941" offset="2760120">Section 144 directs how those provisions of law shall be construed, and Congress ordinarily does not direct this Court and the Federal courts how to construe the Constitution, and under the canon that general words are known by their more specific companions, the words, any other provision of law is understood to refer to the preceding words, this act, to refer only to Federal statutes and regulations implementing them.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.188" offset="2865132">Section... second, section 144 protects only California laws regarding two specifically defined subjects, the percentage of milk solids, and solid not... solids not fat in fluid milk products sold at retail, and the labeling of those products.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.982" offset="2928348">The laws challenged here do not concern either subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.582" offset="2946738">They instead concern how California handlers account to the California equalization pool for purchases of out-of-State raw milk which may or may not ultimately be processed into fluid milk products subject to the composition and labeling requirements.</text>

            <text syncTime="1126.487" offset="4646369">There are two distinct and separate inquiries in construing section 7254.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.430" offset="4666118">First, does it create a Dormant Commerce Clause exemption for any California law, and second, what laws are within the scope of section 7254?</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.697" offset="4703212">As regards the first step, it is unmistakably clear that Congress in adopting section 7254 intended to provide a Dormant Commerce Clause exemption for at least California's milk content and labeling laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.365" offset="4753889">As regards the second step, the scope of section 7254 encompasses not just the milk content and labeling laws themselves, but also the various means that California uses to continue those laws in effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="1210.673" offset="4983140">But I... I do think the... the word construed is simply out of place when Congress is saying something to this Court about how to... how to interpret the Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1229.472" offset="5058268">If they want to delimit the scope of the protection of section 7254 merely to preempt, they wouldn't have added two additional phrases, and in addition to that, many of the preemption savings statutes use the term, this act or other... any other act of Congress, or lists a set of acts or regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.050" offset="5152623">They don't simply have the statement of one act and then a... a general term like, any other provision of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1259.195" offset="5177178">Of course, Congress is sort of at a loss for words, because it... it's only the Commerce Clause... that's the only provision of the Constitution that Congress can instruct us not to apply, so it's understandable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.369" offset="5233916">Maybe out of respect for the rest of our body of law they... they might use the word construe, right?</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.064" offset="5260665">I mean, we don't have any other examples of where... unless it was the... the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which... which we did not uphold.</text>

            <text syncTime="1292.651" offset="5311029">That's... that's correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.123" offset="5320851">There's two ways the Congress can act to save State laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.185" offset="5345093">One is by a preemption savings statute, and the other is by a Dormant Commerce Clause exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.605" offset="5366827">And beyond that, Congress can't affect the State exercise of authority through any means that involves the Constitution, and that, the... the first question then is, does section 7254 create a Dormant Commerce Clause exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.048" offset="5456583">And then, as I indicated, the choice really is, is it preemption only or something more and the statute itself, by using the terms, prohibit or otherwise limit, suggests that it is, or states directly that it is something more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.211" offset="5517292">If they just simply wanted to have this as a preemption savings statute they would have stopped at preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.470" offset="5538294">And again, the argument was raised, well, why didn't they mention the Constitution directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.199" offset="5561178">None of the two areas where there have been cases in which the Court has found a Dormant Commerce Clause exemption, one of which is the McCarran-Ferguson Act and the other of which is the Northeast Bancorp case, was there mention of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.872" offset="5623872">They... they looked at... at the total, at what the statute said, at what the context was in which those statutes were adopted, and... and from that concluded that Congress had intended to fully regulate in those areas or to provide a Dormant Commerce Clause exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.227" offset="5685312">The petitioners have tried to use a doctrine of adjustum generis, the laws are interpreted in the company they keep.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.565" offset="5726689">I've never seen an application of that doctrine where all you have is one statute or one item mentioned, and then you say any others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.297" offset="5753543">Usually that doctrine's applied when you have three or four items.</text>

            <text syncTime="1405.955" offset="5764201">Mr. Urban, the problem, as I see it, is not whether they... you might construe the language as broad enough to cover the Dormant Commerce Clause, but the thing it saves is, legislation regarding milk solids and fats and so forth, and doesn't say anything about saving pricing legislation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1424.007" offset="5836404">That's the second inquiry, what is the scope of the statute, and they are distinct inquiries, and it would be possible for the Court to determine that the statute doesn't cover pooling and pricing laws--</text>

I don't agree with that, Your Honor, because I think that what Congress did in 7254, and this goes to the scope of the statute, is that they protected the composition and labeling laws themselves, and they also, by using terms like, directly or indirectly, establish or continue in effect, regarding rather than regulating, referred to something more, and that something more are the means that California uses to enable the laws to continue in effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="2628.282" offset="10653488">Then you have a Dormant Commerce Clause and you say, well, we have a different rule for that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2632.573" offset="10670729">Well, that's what the Court did in New England Power Company v. New Hampshire, and the statute being construed, the provision of the Federal Power Act being construed in that case, like the statute being construed in this case, was not so much a preemption clause as an unpreemption clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.907" offset="10724018">The typical statute that comes before this Court alleged to be a Dormant Commerce Clause exemption is one that says certain State laws are protected, or are allowed, and in many of those cases the Court has said, and New England Power v. New Hampshire is a good example, the Court has often said yes, those State laws are not subject to preemption under Federal law, but there is no unmistakably clear Dormant Commerce Clause exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.599" offset="10830807">So the... the Court's jurisprudence as I read it is really rather consistent in setting a higher standard for exemptions for the Dormant Commerce Clause, and there's a reason for that, and the reason for that is that the Commerce Clause is part of the... is one of the structural provisions of the Constitution and, as this Court pointed out in the South-Central Timber case, the particularly strong rule of construction ensures that all States know what's going on and have their say in Congress before the protections the States have vis-a-vis one or another... vis-a-vis one another are altered.</text>

            <text syncTime="2918.836" offset="11815728">--exemption, and with respect to the Privileges and Immunities Clause on the ground that location is not the same as residency or citizenship, and we need not look behind location of production to ask whether it is so closely correlated with residency or citizenship as to create an improper... a classification that must be scrutinized under the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.357" offset="11893782">Mr. Urban pointed out that the McCarran-Ferguson Act uses the verb construe, and rightly so, but what it says the Court is not to construe as forbidding State regulation is Congress' silence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.696" offset="11947176">It is not a directive how to construe the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.432" offset="11958147">It is a very proper statute, perhaps the model for how a Dormant Commerce Clause exemption should be written.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.905" offset="11988032">Don't construe our silence to mean we want to stop the States from doing something.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.575" offset="12002660">The statute here is very different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.992" offset="12008407">The statute here says, construe this act or any other provision of law in particular ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.722" offset="12027320">Mr. Urban, in talking about section 7254, said at one point, the use of three different verbs, only one of which is preempts, suggests that Congress' intent was something more than merely to negate Federal preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.771" offset="12103493">I respectfully submit that suggesting that Congress had more in mind is not enough to meet the unmistakable clarity standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.930" offset="12136094">Under Gregory v. Ashcroft, an unmistakable clarity standard means it would be plain to anyone reading the act what Congress had in mind, and merely saying the use of three verbs suggests something does not make it plain to anyone reading the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.970" offset="12188234">I do think... Justice Stevens asked Ms. McDowell if the Court needs to reach the Privileges and Immunities Clause claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.055" offset="12232642">I... I believe the Court does need to reach the Privileges and Immunities Clause claim in the limited way we have suggested and that is because, although Ms. McDowell correctly said the petitioners might prevail on remand under the Commerce Clause and, indeed, I hope we will, and if we do that will give all of my clients the relief that they need, we also might not prevail under the Commerce Clause, and I think we're entitled to pursue both the Commerce Clause claim and, with respect to the individual petitioners, the Privileges and Immunities Clause claim on remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.863" offset="12343819">The... Justice Kennedy asked me some questions in my opening argument about the Federal marketing orders in effect in Nevada and Arizona, and I... I perhaps didn't speak with sufficient clarity about two aspects of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.074" offset="12404737">The Federal milk marketing orders cover parts of Nevada but not other parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.656" offset="12419052">Some are and some are not covered by Federal milk marketing orders, but in any event, it's worth making clear that the marketing orders fundamentally operate on the processors of milk, not on the producers of milk, so when we say the Federal milk marketing orders operate in parts of Nevada, we're really talking about Nevada processors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.657" offset="12491045">If you ship your milk to a California processor it... it is at no point governed by a Federal milk marketing order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.522" offset="12510480">Whatever... with respect to the unmistakably clear standard, Mr. Urban made the argument that once you've found an unmistakably clear Dormant Commerce Clause exemption, the unmistakably clear standard has no more role to play and it's just a matter of ordinary statutory interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.541" offset="12586549">This Court's cases, I believe, do not support that proposition, but he spoke specifically about the McCarran-Ferguson Act cases in which the Court has construed the phrase, business of insurance, without any particular thumb on the scale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.370" offset="12633883">Well, that is how the Court must construe the phrase, business of insurance, because Congress has delegated authority over an entire business to the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.319" offset="12677664">That's very different from this very precisely drawn statute that speaks about two particular aspects of California's compositional regulation of raw milk and saying, well, let's just resort to ordinary principles of statutory interpretation to determine whether that also reaches economic regulation of fluid milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.489" offset="12750389">The unmistakably clear standard is still in effect, and ingenious arguments about the relationship between economic regulation of fluid milk and composition regulation of raw milk are not enough to meet that standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.449" offset="12798245">In particular, it cannot possibly be the case that the 1997 amendments to California's pooling plan are somehow necessary to effect composition regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.934" offset="12848192">The main thing the 1997 amendments did was not negate the possibility that out-of-State milk would flood California to such an extent that there would be price effects that ultimately would have... would have sanitary effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.493" offset="12906392">What the 1997 amendments did essentially was say, we're going to intercept some of the revenue that would otherwise go to out-of-State processors at California's border and redistribute it just to in-State interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.311" offset="12961667">We're going to take some of the money that they would otherwise get in their milk transaction and say, it must go to Californians, not to you out-of-Staters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.545" offset="12990611">That's the essence of the Commerce Clause violation in this case, and it's also inconceivable that that kind of regulation could be protected by this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.420" offset="13030108">If that kind of regulation is protected by this statute, then a regulation that says 100 percent of every milk check that would be written to a Nevadan must instead go to a Californian is protected by this statute, i.e., no out-of-State milk, and that can't possibly be the unmistakably clear intent of Congress in section 7254.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.267" offset="13109520">One last detail, and it is just a detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.391" offset="13125925">Mr. Urban said that 10 to 15 percent of the milk that comes into California is from out of State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.073" offset="13148704">I understand from a publication that's cited at page 39 of our opening brief called Dairy Profit Weekly that the actual number is closer to 3 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.872" offset="13183917">When Congressman Bill Thomas spoke at a field hearing... thank you.</text>
