            <text syncTime="193.410" offset="907931">The Second Circuit, most respectfully, Your Honor, has said that only in a very few cases would it be completely clear on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.529" offset="940427">The other reason that I think this rule is superior to the procedural default rule is that it would bring certitude to this area, where people would know with some degree of confidence that it should be brought in a collateral proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="313.367" offset="1387853">If you... if you have a choice between two proceedings and one proceeding, certainly there's something to be said for one proceeding, although your argument is that one proceeding simply isn't as effective as two, but I think you have to recognize that all things being equal, it would be better having one proceeding than two.</text>

            <text syncTime="339.250" offset="1491297">What I might say, as an example to this Court, think of the dilemma a defense lawyer faces in the Second Circuit where one, if he sees evidence of ineffectiveness but it's not fully developed, and he doesn't raise it because he doesn't think he's obliged to, there's a risk of procedural default.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.170" offset="1559007">If he does raise it and it's not been fully developed, it may be resolved by the court on a partial record, whereas if he'd been in a 2255 proceeding, he could have expanded and amplified the record, which would have strengthened the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.795" offset="1613551">The third option is, that the Second Circuit seems to direct is, raise it at the earliest possible moment, identify it, and then perhaps we will send it back for remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.007" offset="1654406">Well, that, that seems to just complicate the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.815" offset="1665586">And then finally, Your Honor, I think one of the most compelling arguments, which the Solicitor General agrees with, that this would put an end to needless expenditure of judicial resources on resolving the... the cause and prejudice rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.959" offset="1726191">Remember, in a circuit like the Second Circuit, every single man, woman that goes into a 2255 proceeding because they have this direct appeal rule as an exception must establish cause and prejudice at the threshold.</text>

            <text syncTime="421.729" offset="1821276">Obviously, if you had the same lawyer, that would... Your Honor, that would really be cause, so it may be that he would be able to easily overcome the cause aspect, but he still has the prejudice aspect that he has to establish.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.776" offset="1873417">In the other circuits, he can go right in on a 2255, and... and 2255 itself says that unless it's conclusively established that his... his papers are without merit, a hearing shall be granted, so there's a terrible disparity in the way defendants are treated who are trying to... to restore this most important right.</text>

I think the reason the Solicitor General endorsed this rule for over 20 years, and they've changed their mind now, but certainly we've cited case after case where they argued to this Court that... that this is the best way to do it, to bring it in a collateral proceeding, because that is the fairest, the simplest.</text>

            <text syncTime="937.617" offset="3884845">With that being said, I'd like to close by just simply urging the Court that since one of the most cherished policies of this Nation is that, and of the criminal justice system is that a person is entitled to the effective assistance of counsel, but if that right is rendered meaningless because if he's denied that safeguard, he has no effective remedy to cure it, then it seems to me the right has been sadly lost, and I would ask this Court to adopt the rule that we urge.</text>

            <text syncTime="1878.481" offset="7648254">I think it's been generally recognized by several courts that ineffective assistance claims are often raised on collateral review, and I think it's fair to say that in a significant portion of... of 2255 petitions, an ineffective assistance of counsel claim will be at least one ground for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.384" offset="7711889">And one effect of applying a procedural default principle would be to encourage the raising and resolution of those claims on direct appeal in those situations in which it's appropriate, and I think it's important to point out that there are at least some cases in which a court of appeals can resolve, on the basis of the trial record, that the... that trial counsel either was or was not ineffective, and this Court, for example, in its... in its Kimmelman decision, the... pointed out that trial counsel's ineffectiveness, at least in terms of the performance prong of the Strickland inquiry, was apparent from the trial record, and there will be situations like that that arise every so often, and perhaps more frequently an appellate court will be able to determine that trial counsel's performance was not ineffective and will be able to make that determination perhaps because, no matter how deficient the performance was, the... the particular matter at issue could never have resulted in prejudice for the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.722" offset="7933198">For example, if the claim of ineffectiveness is that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to competently impeach a particular witness, an appellate court could perhaps look at the trial record and determine that the testimony of that particular witness was not central to the prosecution's case, and in those circumstances, could a more effective impeachment have given rise to a reasonable probability that the result at trial would have been different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.976" offset="8030269">So there are going to be some situations in which a court of appeals can resolve an ineffectiveness claim at the time of direct appeal, and in those situations, it seems appropriate to encourage the raising of the claim at that stage in order to promote respect for the finality of criminal judgments and also to promote the resolution of legal claims at the earliest feasible opportunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="2070.194" offset="8415105">And in terms of the distinction between appellate counsel calling into question trial counsel's ineffectiveness, and trial counsel calling into question his own ineffectiveness, Justice Kennedy, this Court in Kimmelman observed what I think would... is a common sense proposition, which is that trial counsel is unlikely to bring into question his own competence at trial and, in fact, he would... he would create a conflict situation, and therefore the system just doesn't operate on the assumption that trial counsel should be required to identify his own ineffectiveness and bring it to the attention of the trial court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2150.978" offset="8738292">And in fact, the Court has made clear in decisions such as Murray versus Carrier and Smith versus Murray, and... and recently in Smith versus Robbins, that it's difficult to make out a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel because appellate counsel's decision whether to raise a particular claim is the hallmark of effective advocacy, and one would have to show that appellate counsel was unreasonable in failing to present one claim instead of another at the time of appellate briefing in order to establish that there was cause for failing to raise ineffective assistance of trial counsel at the time of direct appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2591.498" offset="10500303">That became the pivotal point of the trial, and... and the affidavits don't simply talk about avenues the defense lawyer should have taken, what the affidavits say is that it is highly unlikely that this bullet was fired in that car, and they say that it is not consistent with the chief and one and only witness that was involved in the homicide, so what was missing, the indispensable component for an ineffectiveness claim was the prejudice.</text>

            <text syncTime="2649.215" offset="10731226">If this Court adopts the rule that a ineffectiveness claim can be brought under 2255 and does not have to be first explored in those few cases on direct appeal, then there certainly can be no claim made against appellate counsel for not raising that claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="2668.689" offset="10809071">The... the Second Circuit has held in a case, it's unreported so I won't discuss it, but you should know that there's a holding that the Legal Aid Society, when it went over to the Appeals Bureau, that was a different lawyer, even though it was the same society, so it... it is... there's ambiguity there, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.979" offset="10882213">What if the trial lawyer goes out and gets what he thinks is a good appellate lawyer to come in Of Counsel with him, and the new appellate lawyer comes in and he sees the colleague who brought him into the case has got...
