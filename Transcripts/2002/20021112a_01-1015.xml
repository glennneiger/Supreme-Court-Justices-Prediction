            <text syncTime="3616.183" offset="14608912">Mr. Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.392" offset="14625735">There's no evidence in this case that Colonel Baker was ever in petitioner's store, and his particular affidavit was challenged and disregarded by the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.863" offset="14663561">What we have here is a choice between two standards to interpret the FTDA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.905" offset="14691773">Our choice is grounded in the actual use, words that Congress used, and the respondent's position is grounded in the academic theory of dilution which we say is way ahead of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.394" offset="14749660">Our standard is objective and predictable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.769" offset="14767214">Theirs is subjective, unpredictable, invites the courts to substitute its own judgment for consumer perceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.231" offset="14801069">It's consistent with almost nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.115" offset="14812563">Our standard focuses on measurable consumer perception.</text>
            <text syncTime="3673.785" offset="14839312">Theirs focuses at the beginning on semantic similarity, and a presumption that dilution follows from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.057" offset="14876406">Our standard merely puts the famous mark owner to their proof to show that Congress' words, the lessening of the capacity, has been established as a matter of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="3699.065" offset="14940354">They should not get a national injunction without that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3705.670" offset="14966790">Our standard keeps trademark law in its proper bounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3710.549" offset="14986330">Their standard merely rewards the achievement of fame.</text>
            <text syncTime="3715.462" offset="15005974">Our standard, if applied in this case, should result in this Court reversing the injunction and directing that the petitioners be allowed to use Victor's given name in their business.</text>
