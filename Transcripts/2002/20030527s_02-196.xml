            <label>Justice Clarence Thomas</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="85272">The second opinion I have to announce for the Court is National Park Hospitality Association versus Department of Interior, No. 02-196.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.404" offset="138875">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.296" offset="170431">To make visits to national parks more enjoyable for the public, Congress has authorized a national park service to enter into concession contract for various goods and services.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.734" offset="216198">In regulations issued in April 2000, the park service took the position that concession contracts are not subject to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, the CDA.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.239" offset="270219">That Act provides certain protections for entities contracting with the United States Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.511" offset="295296">Petitioner, an association of concessioners doing business in the national parks challenged the regulation’s validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.052" offset="329465">The District Court held in favor of the park service and the Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.091" offset="349631">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we vacate that judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand with instructions to dismiss because the controversy is not yet ripe.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.589" offset="391532">Determining whether administrative action is ripe for judicial review requires us to evaluate two considerations: First, the fitness of the issues for judicial decision, and second, the hardship for the parties withholding judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.696" offset="459972">Taking the hardship question first, the regulation here is nothing more than a general policy statement informing the public of the park services views on the proper application of the CDA.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.310" offset="506470">As such, the regulation does not create adverse effects of a strictly legal kind and does not affect a concessioner's primary conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.369" offset="546699">Petitioner argues that delaying judicial resolution of the issue will cause real harm because the CDA’s applicability is one of the factors taken into account by concessioners preparing its bids.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.107" offset="605631">We are not persuaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.050" offset="613468">Mere uncertainty as to the validity of a legal rule does not constitute a hardship for purposes of the ripeness analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.010" offset="645233">In short, petitioner has failed to demonstrate the hardship required for the controversy to be ripe</text>
            <text syncTime="146.579" offset="671564">Nor is the issue presented fit for review, even though the question is purely legal and the regulation constitutes final agency action under the APA, both parties rely on specific characteristics of certain types of concession contracts to support their position.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.938" offset="748991">Such reliance demonstrates that further factual development would significantly advance our ability to deal with the legal issue presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.788" offset="784413">Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment; Justice Breyer has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice O’Connor joined.</text>
