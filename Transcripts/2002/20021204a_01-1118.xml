            <label>Mr. Roy T. Englert, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="13.458" offset="211455">Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.052" offset="225770">This case comes to the Court in a remarkable posture.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.190" offset="238309">If you agree with the Hobbs Act arguments in the blue briefs, you should reverse the jury verdicts and direct entry of judgment for the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.703" offset="268402">But even if you believe the arguments in the red and gray briefs, you should still reverse, but for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.565" offset="291808">And whatever you do on the Hobbs Act, you should reverse the RICO injunction because RICO simply does not authorize private injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.147" offset="318139">Now, why do I say so starkly that even respondents and the Government's theories require reversal of the jury verdict?</text>
            <text syncTime="46.568" offset="343844">Because the attempts in those briefs, to salvage the theory of plaintiffs' case, concede that someone must obtain the victim's property for the offense of extortion to be shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.425" offset="387312">And the whole reason the Court granted cert on the Hobbs Act issue was to review the Seventh Circuit's holding directly contrary to those concessions that, quote, a loss to, or interference with the rights of the victim is all that is required, closed quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.112" offset="450005">Likewise, the jury was instructed that all it had to find was that the defendants caused someone, quote, to give up a property right, closed quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.803" offset="492846">You will find in the red and gray briefs very elaborate efforts to suggest meanings of obtain and property under which the record in this case supposedly could support a finding that petitioners obtained some abstract form of property from the clinics or women.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.889" offset="545196">But no defense of the Seventh Circuit's holding and the jury instructions that substituted the phrases, interference with and give up for obtaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.434" offset="579364">So there ought to be no question that some form of reversal is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.028" offset="593679">Now, the reason why there should be reversal for the entry of judgment for the defendants, and not just for a new trial, is that respondents and the Government's brief-formulated conceptions of obtaining and property are wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.916" offset="641222">The essence of the theories is that petitioners obtained control over the use and disposition of clinic assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.923" offset="673300">To refer to that as obtaining property of another... the language of the Hobbs Act... is an awfully broad use of language.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.982" offset="701512">It's a far cry from the New York law on which the Hobbs Act was based.</text>

            <text syncTime="138.954" offset="713424">I suppose in some instances one competitor can buy another competitor's firm and just close it up in a regular business transaction, and that... that would be obtaining it in that sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.978" offset="757519">Now, of course, I recognize that title transfers, et cetera, et cetera.</text>

            <text syncTime="185.356" offset="898998">One is the Hobbs Act has historical predecessors that this Court has said should be looked to in interpreting its terms.</text>

            <text syncTime="196.091" offset="941943">I mean, would you really speak of obtaining somebody's property when you... when you interfere with that person's use of it?</text>

            <text syncTime="202.945" offset="969320">I certainly don't concede it's a relevant sense of obtain.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.257" offset="978619">Because of... because of the Hobbs Act historical antecedents, because of the rule of lenity, because of the very odd use of language, for all those reasons, that's not how the Court should interpret obtain.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.281" offset="1022714">But more important than any of those things is the implications of such a theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.368" offset="1039014">When Carry Nation went into saloons with her axe and destroyed property, she certainly interfered with the property owner's unfettered use and control over disposition of his assets, and that's exactly what she intended to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.829" offset="1144863">Was that extortion?</text>
            <text syncTime="233.371" offset="1091050">The civil rights boycott of white merchants that the Court considered in Claiborne Hardware certainly affected the ability of the boycotted merchants to use their property and involved isolated acts of violence as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.860" offset="1149042">These aren't hypothetical concerns.</text>

            <text syncTime="279.417" offset="1275266">But my fundamental point is not that one case was or wasn't charged as... as extortion.</text>
