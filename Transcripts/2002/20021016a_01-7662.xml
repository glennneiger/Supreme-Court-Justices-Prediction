            <text syncTime="69.640" offset="421099">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="72.612" offset="433011">Hernandez v. New York described a hypothetical case, a case in which the evidence of racial discrimination during jury selection was so strong that, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="85.328" offset="483898">"a finding of no discrimination is simply too incredible to be accepted. "</text>
            <text syncTime="90.545" offset="504796">This is truly that exceptional case, and therefore the Court should use it as a model, a model of the weight of evidence sufficient to render objectively unreasonable a trial judge's rejection of a Batson challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.560" offset="580864">Indeed, whatever--</text>

            <text syncTime="109.560" offset="580864">Well, now you... you... Mr.... Mr. Waxman, you've got two presumptions going against you here: the... the first, the Hernandez presumption that the trial court has to be deferred to, and then the AEDPA presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.729" offset="633527">So I... I hope you'll take those into account.</text>

            <label>Mr. Seth P. Waxman</label>
            <text syncTime="124.958" offset="642409">--I want to embrace them, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.559" offset="652858">[Laughter]</text>
            <text syncTime="127.930" offset="654321">I fully recognize, as an officer of this Court and somebody who has followed this jurisprudence, that even on direct... that the deference that is paid to a trial judge in a Batson hearing is so strong that even in Hernandez, this case said on direct review... and Hernandez made reference to the high standards of proof in habeas... even on direct review, we are going to require proof that a trial court's finding of fact in a Batson hearing is erroneous by clear and convincing evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.044" offset="790784">And to that, AEDPA enacted subsection 2254(d)(2), which says that you... a writ may not issue unless the State court adjudication resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.356" offset="871973">There are very good reasons to provide these dual levels of deference to the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.293" offset="899767">The trial judge in the case, of course, is the finder of fact, and in Hernandez this Court has made clear that the ultimate finding in this case, the finding of whether or not the trial prosecutor engaged in intentional discrimination in making race the tipping factor, a but-for factor with respect to the strike of any peremptory... of any juror under a peremptory challenge... is a factual determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.129" offset="1023065">But (d)(2) and the clear and convincing evidence standard are there for a reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.947" offset="1054412">They are there for the truly exceptional case in which there are reasons to believe that the trial judge's findings are deluded, and there are reasons to believe that the evidence suggesting that the trial judge's finding was unreasonable are overwhelming.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.211" offset="1119405">And I'd like to address the first first and the second second, because I think it is entirely clear that given the facts of this case and the way in which the... the trial judge in this case conducted the hearing, that whatever this Court decides, this case is going to stand as a benchmark, either that these facts represent an extreme that cannot be tolerated or that even these extreme facts are tolerable under Batson.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.319" offset="1243852">Now, let me speak first to the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.714" offset="1253465">The trial judge was conscientious and he was, of course, to some extent disabled by the fact that the trial in this case immediately preceded this Court's decision in Batson.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.497" offset="1300590">That is, this is one of these few cases where the trial occurred before Batson, but the case was pending on direct appeal when Batson was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.231" offset="1335490">And so we have in this case a trial judge who conducted the Batson hearing over 2 years after the jurors testified and after the trial prosecutors gave their reasons for all but two of the jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.246" offset="1407587">And therefore, the one hallmark of deference, which is that the trial judge is a percipient witness of the res gestae, if you will, did not exist in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.035" offset="1454712">The... the decided cases under the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals reflect significantly more than a dozen cases decided by this judge in that 2-year interim period.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.924" offset="1502255">He saw thousands of venire members and undoubtedly heard hundreds, if not thousands, of Batson explanations.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.674" offset="1537259">And moreover, whereas it is true that the trial judge observes the demeanor of the witnesses and a prosecutor can certainly use as a race-neutral reason questions raised about a juror's fitness or suitability based on demeanor, the objections in this case, with one limited exception, the prosecutor said nothing about the demeanor.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.566" offset="1636838">The prosecutor's stated objections to the 10 of the 11 African Americans who were struck were substantive reasons there on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.187" offset="1675290">In addition, the trial judge in this case did not--</text>

            <text syncTime="385.954" offset="1686366">Well, but certainly demeanor could play a part in that even though you don't... you don't say it.</text>

            <text syncTime="391.072" offset="1706846">You say he's... he's prejudiced against the Government and, you know, perhaps the way he answered questions may give you a reason to think that, that the transcript doesn't.</text>

            <text syncTime="402.506" offset="1752613">--I can... I... I embrace that, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.850" offset="1765987">For many years before I entered this line of work, I was a trial lawyer and I can remember exercising peremptory strikes just because of hesitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.478" offset="1800469">My only limited point here is that unlike many voir dire hearings... and I've now reviewed many... there was only one single isolated instance in which the prosecutor, in giving his reasons either at the time or in the Batson hearing, said he hesitated or his demeanor led me to question it.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.849" offset="1874030">And so in that one respect, I... again I think this case is more susceptible to meaningful appellate review.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.144" offset="1907153">But I have two more points I think it's very important for the Court to consider about the way this trial judge conducted this unusual case.</text>

            <text syncTime="459.970" offset="1982490">There was an immediate appeal taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.828" offset="1989909">During the... right after... I think a month after the case was tried, Batson was decided, and 2 years later, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals abated... the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals said 10 of 11 African Americans were struck.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.278" offset="2047692">That raises an inference of discrimination under Batson.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.372" offset="2060022">Remand it for a Batson hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.480" offset="2068485">And it was at that hearing that the judge made the findings of fact and conclusions of law that are reflected in the... in the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.261" offset="2107669">There was a subsequent habeas proceeding in the State courts, but the habeas proceeding didn't deal with the Batson issue because it had been fully exhausted.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.988" offset="2142569">The trial judge, in evaluating Batson, did not look at the very substantial evidence of pattern and practice evidence with respect to what was going on in Dallas County at this time, evidence that the magistrate deemed appalling.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.062" offset="2210801">He was told by the State not to look at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.239" offset="2223548">He did not consider what the State acknowledges to be racially disparate... disparate questioning of the jurors in venire on the question... their ability to impose a minimum sentence--</text>

            <text syncTime="1295.623" offset="5325119">And it doesn't account for the fact that their 10 white jurors wildly understates the number of white jurors who expressed hesitation about the death penalty.</text>

            <text syncTime="1416.094" offset="5806921">And that to us is evidence of conduct that occurred during voir dire that admits of only a racial explanation just as their conduct of the jury shuffle, which is a ubiquitous and unique Texas practice that exists only in the State of Texas.</text>

            <text syncTime="1636.886" offset="6690174">In fact, the judge told them at the outset, that if they were... when the order was finally set, if they were in the last two rows, they could just go home that day and never come back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.719" offset="6725491">And so the consequence of shuffling in this case wasn't the consequence you'd have if you had 50 jurors picked... this is a capital case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1662.232" offset="6791529">If you could get... if the... if the prosecution could get the black jurors out of the first 15 or 20 and into the back, they wouldn't have to worry about the disparate questioning or exercising peremptory challenges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.031" offset="6842729">And the... the record in this case I think... it doesn't involve an admission but it is very, very strong evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.204" offset="6875434">I... I just want to say, before sitting down for rebuttal, a point that may be obvious, but it is surpassingly important for this Court to decide the merits of the Batson challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.954" offset="6946383">There are many areas in the law in which... in which this Court delineates the contours of constitutional doctrine by demonstrating what result a given set of facts yields.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.040" offset="6998732">And so too Batson's abstract rules, its doctrines about the burden of proof and the quantum of proof, can also only be demonstrated and meaningfully elucidated by a model.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.067" offset="7058814">This is the kind of area like voluntariness, ineffective assistance of counsel, First Amendment actual malice in which this Court can and, I submit, under (d)(2) must model a case for the State courts and the lower Federal courts to show what quantum of evidence is sufficient to require a conclusion that a trial court's acceptance of a prosecutor as Batson's avowed reasons are objectively unreasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1773.195" offset="7235401">Prosecutors in this case exercised their peremptory challenges to remove prospective jurors whom they believed were biased against the State, a belief based not on stereotypical assumptions but on the views actually expressed by these jurors during voir dire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.881" offset="7298095">The trial judge, who observed firsthand the entire voir dire process, credited the prosecutors' race-neutral, case-related reasons for the strikes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1857.657" offset="7573217">First, petitioner's attempts to make comparisons with white jurors are not supported by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.286" offset="7607698">They do not have equivalent views, and in any event, to the extent that disparate questioning happened, it was certainly based on the... the... either in the case of the graphic script questioning based on the jurors' responses to questions on the questionnaires or in the case of the minimum punishment question... questioning on a combination of the responses in the questionnaires and the responses to questioning in the voir dire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.865" offset="7734027">So that would be circumstantial evidence, but it is not present in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3419.896" offset="13822125">How likely are they to be able to consider the full range of punishment in a capital murder case?</text>

            <text syncTime="3462.499" offset="13992547">The... while the graphic script was given at the beginning of the voir dire and therefore based only on the questionnaires, the minimum punishment ploy... that is, trying to trick jurors about minimum punishment... was done at the very end, after they had all of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.103" offset="14055032">And therefore, the relevant universe of whites who expressed hesitation is not 10, as the State says, but 19.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.988" offset="14086484">And in any event, even with 10, they are three-and-a-half times as likely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.241" offset="14103516">With... also, we did... the trial... the defense lawyers in this case objected over and over and over again to trying to trick these black jurors by asking them what minimum punishment they would give without expressing the number.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.018" offset="14162657">The voir dire is replete with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.702" offset="14173419">With respect to the graphic script, which did come at the beginning, well, the State now says, well, we don't have the questionnaires for all the people, so we don't really know how many there were.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.251" offset="14223574">We know that we used the graphic script with three of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.306" offset="14235800">Okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.011" offset="14238621">The three that they used that they identified are jurors 27, 59, and 68.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.872" offset="14262027">Two were excused by agreement, and one, number 68, was seated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.670" offset="14277282">But we do know what the juror questionnaires were... I'm just doing a... sort of a quick list on the back of my note card here... for Mr. Vickery, Ms. Mazza, Mr. Gutierrez, Mr. Hearn, and Mr. Duke.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.297" offset="14347813">Mazza, who is... who features prominently here and who is not included in their 10, said in her questionnaire, it depends on the crime.</text>
