            <text syncTime="1213.830" offset="4990292">As we read Darden, there is language that is certainly broad enough in it to say that any time you use the word, employee, you mean common law employee, but I think that those, what... you have to understand Darden in the context of the... the issue it was resolving in that case, and there it was trying to draw a distinction, whether the term employee embraces independent contractors, and in that setting, Congress had twice amended statutes to make clear that the term, employee, did not mean independent contractor after this Court has said that it could, and in that context, it makes perfect sense to start out with a very strong presumption that when Congress uses the term, employee, it does not mean independent contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.374" offset="5168551">But that's not the situation we have here, and in other cases where the Court has looked at statutes that use common law terms, like Title VII does with respect to the term, agent, it has felt a lot more freedom to adjust that common law term to the purposes of the statute, and I would point you to the Faragher case and the Kolstadt case as two examples of that, and that's what the EEOC has done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.305" offset="5268235">It has adapted that common law principle in light of the fact that we have an established tradition in the courts, well-established, of looking at the question of partnership in a functional way, does this person actually operate as a proprietor of the business, or is this a partner in name only, and it makes perfect sense for the EEOC to apply that same kind of functional analysis in deciding whether shareholder-directors are employees, because for purposes of deciding who should get the protection of the act, and that's what we're talking about primarily here, there is no practical difference between shareholder-directors who run a business and partners who run a business, and so it makes sense to... to use the same test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.855" offset="5442419">Applying the same test also makes sense in light of the purposes of the small business exemption, because the purpose of that exemption is to spare small businesses the very substantial burdens of complying with the nondiscrimination laws, and those burdens are experienced in exactly the same way regardless of whether those who choose to organize a small business do so through a partnership form or a corporate form, and the... the analysis that the tests should be the same across the board also makes--</text>

            <text syncTime="1698.251" offset="6928055">Well, the... the reason we said it was that we couldn't find any basis in the statutory history or the text that... that gave us a clue that Congress, in effect, wanted to ignore something which is such hornbook law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.959" offset="6982808">The argument on the other side, I think, is that there is a reason to think Congress would want to look at... at nontraditional concepts here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.164" offset="7019693">The argument is that the common law definition of employee does not axiomatically apply because it's not addressing the issue that Congress was addressing in that... in this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.743" offset="7074027">The issue that Congress was addressing in this statute, as I understand the argument, in fact taking the... the very words that Mr. Gornstein used a moment ago, was the issue of protecting people who can be hurt by discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.521" offset="7133064">It was a protection issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.007" offset="7139020">So that I think what he's saying, and... and what the petitioner's counsel are saying is, the one thing that we do know about employees is that they were people who were intended to be protected by this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.753" offset="7193982">If that is true, it is not probable that they were trying to include as employees, the protected category, people who don't need protection because they are in ultimate control of the business, the ones who, if there's going to be discrimination, are going to be doing the discriminating, so it's probable that the people who have that ultimate control would intend it to be within the employee category.</text>

            <text syncTime="2996.087" offset="12119317">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.734" offset="12119213">The protected class, people in the protected class should be the same as are counted toward the 15-employee threshold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.046" offset="12119108">That is, we should look at the individuals in the business enterprise the same, whether we are determining whether they are eligible to file a lawsuit, or are protected by the act, or are counted towards the act's coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.135" offset="12119004">Must these doctors take the bitter with the sweet?</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.914" offset="12118899">What we're saying is that what these doctors deserve is to be treated the same as their colleagues in businesses that are identical, but have a different form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.625" offset="12118795">That is, these doctors in the professional corporation should be treated the same as doctors in a limited liability partnership or a limited liability company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.186" offset="12118690">Would it be simpler to simply look at the form of the business and stop there?</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.197" offset="12118586">It would, but it would also be simpler if we looked at the term, partner and said, well, partners can never be employees, or we look at the term, independent contractor, and say well, independent contractors can never be employees, but we don't do that for good reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.721" offset="12118481">We look beyond the label, and I'm suggesting that that is appropriate here as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.096" offset="12118377">Look beyond the label and see what the realities are, a reality check.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.784" offset="12118272">Does the EEOC count directors as employees?</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.297" offset="12118168">Generally, in... in business law there's a big difference between a director, an officer, a shareholder, and an employee, so as I read the EEOC guidance, that is a vehicle through which businesses, courts, and the EEOC can look at an individual and determine, well, is the... is the label, director, in this circumstance appropriate, or are they really functioning as an employee?</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.747" offset="12118063">You can, of course, have inside directors, that is, employees who are appointed to the board of directors, or you can have outside directors in some circumstances where they aren't affiliated except in an advisory role, as a member of the board, and they... members of the board of directors could be paid or they could be not paid, and I don't think that's an issue that should necessarily be determinative on deciding whether or not they are an employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.456" offset="12117959">The court of appeals here did not look beyond the fact that the shareholder-directors had organized as a professional corporation, but the trial court did, and looked at factors similar to those identified in the EEOC guidance, and concluded that these shareholder-directors were not employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.802" offset="12117854">We believe that is the correct approach the Court should take.</text>
