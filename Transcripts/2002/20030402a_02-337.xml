            <label>Mr. Donald E. Pinaud, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="10.168" offset="171070">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.595" offset="188728">This case is about the vitality and scope of the rule of construction from Shamrock Oil that says that the removal jurisdiction to Federal courts should be narrowly construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.809" offset="229584">As we see it, the overarching question in this case is, as posed by respondent, whether or not the rule from Shamrock Oil applies to cases brought in State court, but based upon a Federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.261" offset="283396">We think it has to for three reasons, and I'd like to, if I can, list them, and then I'll go back and... and cover each of them individually.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.662" offset="308996">First, respondent proposes an unworkable distinction whereby the... whereby Shamrock Oil is not to be applied where a case is brought under the Fair Labor Standards Act alone, but it should be applied if it's brought together with some State law claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.152" offset="374929">Secondly, Florida has a right to protect its citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.206" offset="391230">And thirdly, the Fair Labor Standards Act is just... just as much a part of the law of Florida as any act of the Florida legislature or any decision of the Florida courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.059" offset="430622">Let me cover that first point first, which is the unworkable distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.949" offset="446191">Respondent concedes that Shamrock Oil would certainly apply in a situation where a State law claim was being brought together with a Fair Labor Standards Act claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.838" offset="485688">In this case we did not bring a State law claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.155" offset="494988">We only brought a Fair Labor Standards Act claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.932" offset="502093">We could have, but we didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.910" offset="505959">If you were to... if you were to have that rule, you would have a situation where whether or not Federal jurisdiction was proper would be wholly dependent upon whether a State claim was brought with Federal action.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.458" offset="548173">We don't think that--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="105.596" offset="552771">But there are unworkable aspects to your position, Mr. Pinaud.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.086" offset="566668">For example, a Title VII case combined with an equal pay case, the equal pay case could not be removed, but the Title VII case could, and then you would split what is essentially one controversy into two parts because one is... is not removable.</text>

            <text syncTime="159.961" offset="770214">And if you're right... if you're right... the equal pay case would have to stay in the State court, although the Title VII case could go forward in the Federal court.</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald E. Pinaud, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="170.358" offset="811801">That would be correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.339" offset="815772">The... the second reason that I think Shamrock Oil applies in this case is because Florida has a right to protect its... its citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.292" offset="867494">This is a dispute between Phillip Breuer, Mr. Breuer, who is a resident of the State of Florida who lives in Duval County, who works for Jim's Concrete of Brevard, which is a company in Brevard County, in an employment relationship that took place in Florida, governed by Florida law.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.889" offset="941891">They worked in many counties in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.687" offset="949101">Certainly then Florida has an interest in that relationship and in this dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.743" offset="965296">This is not a case like Asahi where you have a... a California court looking at a dispute between a... you know, a Taiwanese company and a Japanese company.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.463" offset="1004271">Florida has an interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.708" offset="1009182">The third point is that the Fair Labor Standards Act is just as much a part of the law of Florida as any decision of the Florida legislature or any... or any opinion of its court.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.246" offset="1047321">Under the Supremacy Clause, the laws of the United States are the laws of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.481" offset="1068323">Florida courts have an obligation, an absolute duty, to enforce and uphold the Fair Labor Standards Act just like they have to enforce and uphold the... the Fourth Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.782" offset="1113463">It... it would be unrealistic to say that Florida has an obligation to uphold these laws, but then has no right or no interest in having them upheld in... in Florida courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.051" offset="1170619">So for... for those reasons, we think that Shamrock Oil certainly has to apply to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.373" offset="1195905">If you then go ahead and... and apply the Shamrock... the Shamrock analysis to either the expressly provided language of 1441 or the maintain language of the Fair Labor Standards Act, you have to reach a decision that these cases are... are not properly to be subject to removal.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="286.586" offset="1276676">Well, one can certainly maintain an action in the Florida courts, and unless it's removed, it will continue there.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.695" offset="1309172">I... I... it doesn't seem to me that using the word maintain means that the action must necessarily remain there.</text>

            <text syncTime="301.646" offset="1336967">Well, Mr. Chief Justice, obviously it's our position that maintain in this case does mean that it should remain in State court, and we think it's for a couple of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.025" offset="1378449">The first reason we would say is that once you apply the Shamrock analysis, maintain has to mean what we say because in the very worst-case scenario, at least for our position, maintain is ambiguous or... or capable of two different constructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.049" offset="1442606">Everybody here has argued... the Government argues and respondent argues... that it's ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.657" offset="1460996">Well, if it's ambiguous, if it's capable of meaning you can maintain to a conclusion in State court, or if it is, rather, capable of meaning that you can only really bring or commence it, then under Shamrock Oil, when we apply that analysis, we should use the conclusion that most limits removal, which would be to... which would be to say that maintain means you continue on to... to final judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="365.581" offset="1592653">--Well, Justice Scalia, I think what you have to do, though, is I think when looking at the expressly... expressly otherwise provided language, you have to... first, you have to apply Shamrock Oil to that language.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.424" offset="1648033">Now, it's... it's our position that when Congress used the word expressly provided, otherwise expressly provided, it meant it in a textual sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.064" offset="1686590">That is, the word expressly is capable of two different meanings itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.286" offset="1707487">It can mean super clear or absolutely unambiguous, or rather, it can mean grounded in some text.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.350" offset="1731729">Because it's capable of two different meanings, we think that when you apply Shamrock to expressly, you choose the textual meaning because the textual meaning shrinks removal considerably whereas the other meaning expands it.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.006" offset="1778436">But I think--</text>

            <text syncTime="431.788" offset="1857535">I take it on your reading, 1404(a) couldn't apply either because you would have to... if the plaintiff chose to maintain it in one Federal court, therefore it couldn't be switched to another?</text>

            <text syncTime="533.967" offset="2266194">We also think that the expressly provided language has to be the textual basis based upon this... this Court's construction of 28 U.S.C. 2283.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.849" offset="2309767">That's the anti-injunction statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.219" offset="2315200">In that statute, Congress has provided that no... that no Federal court shall issue an injunction to enjoin a State court proceeding unless expressly authorized by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.888" offset="2361907">We're dealing with expressly provided language in 1441.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.747" offset="2373401">We see the language as completely indistinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.723" offset="2385313">In Mitchum v. Foster, this Court construed that language in 2283 as saying, look, that language does not mean that you have to have a... a statute that says you can issue an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.963" offset="2446230">Rather, what the Court said was, we look at the scope... we look at the purpose and intent of the statute and say is the purpose of... and intent of the statute to allow an injunction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1196.103" offset="4914802">And the point I was making is that maintain has to mean more than simply start or bring or something like that just because, if for no other reason... if you put aside Shamrock and you put aside the policy arguments, for no other reason that Congress in this statute, in the Fair Labor Standards Act, when it enacted it, used the maintain twice, one to mean you can maintain the suit and one to mean that a person can maintain it for you on your behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.927" offset="5022113">And obviously, if Congress is going to give the employee the right to have an agent maintain the suit for him or her, certainly they didn't mean you can just bring it and then somehow, not for removal purposes, but you won't have the authority any more to prosecute it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1371.851" offset="5617809">Also... and I know I've mentioned this a couple times... the word maintain itself... it was the prevailing opinion back then, before 1948, that maintain was express.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.507" offset="5676428">That is the exact language that the Government used in its brief filed in the Johnson case, that this was an express prohibition against removal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1529.653" offset="6249032">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.895" offset="6269930">Since 1875, a defendant in a civil action has had a right to remove a case arising under Federal law to a U.S. district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.651" offset="6316950">This right is currently codified in 28 U.S.C. 1441(a), which authorizes a civil action... the removal of a civil action of which the Federal district court has original jurisdiction except as otherwise expressly... otherwise expressly prohibited by an act of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.498" offset="6404408">The except as otherwise expressly provided language was added in 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.698" offset="6425202">The court below correctly ruled that respondent had a right to remove this case for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.034" offset="6454459">First, the plain language of 1441(a) which allows removal of a case arising under Federal law, such as a Fair Labor Standards Act case, unless Congress has expressly prohibited removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.982" offset="6514332">There is nothing in the text of the Fair Labor Standards Act or its legislative history which even mentions the word removal much less expressly prohibits it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.009" offset="6562397">Second, Congress has explicitly prohibited removal in a series of enactments, and when it has done so, it has used very explicit language directly referring to removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.395" offset="6635958">Third, the words, may be maintained, in any court... or any Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction in the Fair Labor Standards Act is identical to language that Congress has used in other statutes, including the Family Medical Leave Act and the Employee Polygraph Protection Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.167" offset="6731043">If this Court were to rule that removal is barred under the Fair Labor Standards Act, then this would affect those statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.470" offset="6768242">And again, there is nothing in the text of those statutes which suggests that Congress was attempting to prohibit removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.808" offset="6809620">The word is not mentioned in the text or the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.992" offset="6826338">When Congress has prohibited removal in a series of statutes, starting in 1910, it has very directly used the word removal, and this has happened both before and after it enacted the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.235" offset="6907318">In fact, in 1948, Congress created a section of the 28... Title 28 under section 1445 and entitled it Non-Removable Actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.281" offset="6971474">In 1910, Congress stated that certain railroad... cases against railroads under the Federal Employer Liability Act, FELA, that actions arising under those laws may not be removed... used the words, may not be removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.682" offset="7041065">In 1914, Congress passed an enactment stating that certain actions against common carriers may not be removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.992" offset="7082338">In 1933, they passed the Securities Act and used the words, shall not be removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.514" offset="7108461">So these laws were in place using very direct language when the Fair Labor Standards Act was enacted in 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.394" offset="7139912">Since the Fair Labor Standards Act was enacted, we have examples of four different laws that were passed by Congress, some in 1441(a), some stand alone, that use the words, may not be removed or shall not be removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.856" offset="7209816">The last one was the actions under the Violence Against Women's Act of 1994.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.317" offset="7231654">So we know from example after example what Congress had in mind in 1948 when it used the words, except as other expressly provided.</text>

            <text syncTime="2043.950" offset="8306123">If you look at the timing of the addition of that language in 1948, at that time, the right to remove didn't have the expressly provided otherwise exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.475" offset="8360248">It just was a right to remove, and it was at that time codified in 28 U.S.C., section 71, which had the right to remove.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.172" offset="8395043">But coupled in that same paragraph were two examples of cases where Congress said there was no right to remove, the FELA action and the action under the Interstate Commerce Act dealing with loss of... or injury under certain actions against common carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.964" offset="8466201">So right in the same paragraph was this language, may not remove these two types of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.387" offset="8491905">When they reorganized, they moved that language to 1440... 1441... 1445 and I think they were just making clear, when they left the right to remove, that they may from time to time, as they have, expressly prohibit removal of certain actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.976" offset="8562227">So I... I think the... the addition of that language changed nothing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2171.449" offset="8816137">So to the extent that Congress was paying attention to Johnson, it overruled it with the expressly provided other language in 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.683" offset="8853127">If removal were barred in this case, just to finish on the point of the effect on these other laws, you could have a very problematic situation, which I'm sure Congress never intended, of having, for example, an age discrimination case which would not be removable under the ADEA, but a race discrimination case under Title VII that is removable, or a handicap or disability discrimination case under the American with Disabilities Act which would be removable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.954" offset="8986142">You'd have ERISA claims which would be removable, but not claims for leave benefits under the Family Medical Leave Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.373" offset="9023863">You'd have a Title VII sex discrimination claim due to unequal pay that would be removable, but not an Equal Pay Act case under the Fair Labor Standards Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.566" offset="9068585">And again, there's no indication that Congress, in using the words, may be maintained... it simply confers right of action... would have ever intended this effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.712" offset="9109231">Finally, I'd like to just briefly address petitioner's argument in the reply brief dealing with Mitchum v. Foster.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.890" offset="9141936">They're arguing that there's similar language in the anti-injunction statute which says that except as expressly authorized, a State court injunction... a... a Federal court may not enjoin a State court, and relies on Mitchum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.546" offset="9224588">This reliance is misplaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.323" offset="9239634">First, the underlying law in Mitchum was the Civil Rights Act, the 42 U.S.C. 1983 action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.451" offset="9272131">And the Court determined that the power to enjoin a State court under that statute was inherent in the necessary and indispensable power to remedy civil rights violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.500" offset="9340363">And the... the right to enjoin State court actions was absolutely essential to the purpose of 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.401" offset="9379964">Second, the Court observed that it had a long history of making exceptions to the anti-removal statute without directly referring to the anti-removal statute or State court injunctions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2333.214" offset="9463243">And third, in Vendo Company versus Lektro, this Court said that the fact that in Mitchum there was no direct reference to the anti-injunction statute or staying State court injunctions was cured by the fact that there was relevant legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.051" offset="9542550">None of those factors are present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.692" offset="9553104">Obviously, the Fair Labor Standards Act does not rise and fall on this removal issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.907" offset="9574002">Second, Congress has repeatedly made exceptions very expressly and directly referring to removal when it made an exception.</text>

            <text syncTime="2394.284" offset="9707540">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.854" offset="9757799">The general policy of the removal statute is to give the defendant the same right as the plaintiff to have his case heard in Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.857" offset="9793848">The removal statute achieves that objective by permitting the defendant to remove an action to... to Federal court if the plaintiff could have originally filed his suit there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.362" offset="9839824">There is no dispute in this case that the plaintiff could have filed this action in Federal court even had the... even had the defendant preferred that the... that a State court adjudicate the dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.946" offset="9894159">The policies underlying the removal statute are therefore served by giving the defendant the same right to insist upon a Federal forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.262" offset="9927386">Now, the removal statute creates a narrow exception to this policy when another statute expressly bars removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.476" offset="9960301">And Congress has foreclosed removal in a number of statutes in direct and explicit terms by providing most notably in section 1445 of Title 28 that, quote, a civil action in any State court may not be removed, or in other statutes that no case brought in any State court shall be removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.081" offset="10046714">There is no similar prohibition in the Fair Labor Standards Act, which does not address the issue of removal at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.481" offset="10072314">The language in the Fair Labor Standards Act providing that an action may be maintained in any Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction does not expressly foreclose removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.986" offset="10114319">Rather, it grants an employee a cause of action over which State and Federal courts have concurrent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.755" offset="10141381">The language does not purport to trump or override generally applicable rules that affect the disposition of the proceeding such as whether the action may be stayed or transferred under other express statutory provisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2543.662" offset="10305012">There was division and there still is division today, but we think that the 1948 revision makes amply clear that what's required is an express bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.271" offset="10351406">And when compared to the established template of the other statutes where Congress has foreclosed jurisdiction in direct, unambiguous terms, it makes clear that the... the correct answer is that the actions are subject to removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.671" offset="10409084">And the example I wanted to give was about why the word maintain doesn't speak to how the action may be disposed of under other provisions was a bankruptcy petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.465" offset="10464255">Under Federal law that would operate to stay the continuation of any judicial proceeding, and a similar result would hold true under State and Federal venue provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.716" offset="10505215">And we think the same result is true under a Federal removal legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.545" offset="10524545">There's nothing in the Fair Labor Standards Act that suggests that the plaintiff's initial choice of a State law... State court forum must prevail over the defendant's express statutory right to remove an action under section 1441(a), and we think the employee's right to sue accordingly is subject to removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.414" offset="10608033">And the only thing I... I'd like to address in response to the petitioner's argument is this principle of narrow construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.709" offset="10637185">We don't think that principle applies for basically two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.938" offset="10654113">And the first is that because there was no dispute about the Federal court's jurisdiction to hear this case, again notwithstanding Florida's interest in the case or even if the... had the defendant preferred the State court forum, the plaintiff could have insisted that the Federal court hear the dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.859" offset="10725793">And thus the only relevant inquiry is not one of narrow interpretation, but it's a standard that's set forth on the... under the plain terms of the statute itself, and that is whether another statute expressly bars removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.833" offset="10781695">And we think for the reasons that have been given, even if one were to apply a principle of narrow construction, it would not be plausible to construe the word maintain as an express bar to removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.541" offset="10828506">And for those reasons, we would urge that this Court affirm the judgment of the Eleventh Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="2701.574" offset="10936653">And as... as I think I mentioned earlier, I... I just wanted to add, I think respondent agreed with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.051" offset="10954625">I don't agree because, as I stated, if you look through the Reviser's Notes, they... they are extraordinarily meticulous.</text>

            <text syncTime="2791.693" offset="11297143">Not that we know of, but it's our position that that would be because Congress, at the time it passed this law, believed it was express, that that was the prevailing opinion, and that even now that was still the opinion of about half of... about half of the courts, half of... half of the district courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.621" offset="11368823">You know, this is... district courts every day... in fact, after this... I think just before this Court granted certiorari, there was a district court in... in Texas that said, absolutely these cases need to be staying in State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.418" offset="11420023">So I think Congress didn't get... I don't know why Congress didn't get involved in it, but I would think it would be because they thought maintained was express enough, that maintain was good enough.</text>
