            <text syncTime="10.953" offset="186638">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.884" offset="202312">The issue in this case is a narrow one, but it has considerable practical importance for the continuing flow of interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.165" offset="227494">In 1991, Congress enacted a statute that was designed to ease the burdens that State registration fees impose on trucks that travel interstate.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.670" offset="261453">To help accomplish that purpose, the statute provides that a State's registration fee may not exceed the fee that the State collected or charged as of November 15th, 1991.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.643" offset="301368">The question here before the Court is whether that Federal standard precludes a State from now imposing a fee on a category of trucks when the State waived the fee as to that category of trucks and therefore did not actually collect or charge it as of the controlling date.</text>

            <text syncTime="71.099" offset="427174">There is actually nothing in the record, Justice Stevens, that indicates how many States paid fees... how many trucks paid fees and how many did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.918" offset="454446">It's my... our understanding that there were trucks that were not benefitting from the reciprocity policy and therefore they would have paid fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.940" offset="482553">So I think... I think that the answer, although not reflected in the record, is that some trucks paid fees and some did not.</text>

            <text syncTime="111.409" offset="588401">Why shouldn't it be true, if you're right, that if a truck... if a fee was waived as to any truck, it should remain in place?</text>

            <text syncTime="117.612" offset="613270">--Well, we think that the inquiry that's posed by the statute is how were trucks of a particular type treated.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.820" offset="642109">And for example, imagine if a State had in place a sliding scale of fees as to different types of trucks at $10 for red trucks, $5 for white trucks, and nothing for blue trucks.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.523" offset="680875">The statute refers to in... in terms... it says that the State's fee must equal the fee not to exceed $10 per vehicle that the State collected or charged as of November 15th, 1991.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.810" offset="726015">Well, what in that... in that circumstance, what is the fee that the State charged when there are these different categories of trucks?</text>
            <text syncTime="151.060" offset="747017">We think it has to be understood to mean the fee that the State charged to trucks of that type, and so, as I say, in 1991 in Michigan trucks of a particular type, trucks that were base-plated in the State of Illinois, were not subject to fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.987" offset="802710">We, therefore, think that under the plain language of the statute, the same policy has to apply to trucks in that category now.</text>

            <text syncTime="954.175" offset="3959556">Congress assigned responsibility for implementing the single State registration system to the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.737" offset="3985783">The ICC determined that when States apply the statutory fee cap, they must consider the reciprocal fee reductions and reciprocal fee waivers that were in place as of November 15th, 1991.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.606" offset="4033221">That interpretation serves the central purpose of the fee cap provision, which was to grandfather the fees that were in place as of 1991, but only those fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.023" offset="4070942">The Michigan Supreme Court's generic fee rule, on the other hand, would convert Congress's grandfather provision into a provision that would allow new fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.065" offset="4107095">The ICC's interpretation ensures that the capped registration fee is equal to the fee that the State actually collected or charged as of November 15th, 1991.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.530" offset="4148891">Congress did not set the cap at the amount that the States could have charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.757" offset="4161848">If Congress had wanted to do that, the obvious thing to have done would have been to set the cap at $10, which is the amount that the ICC allowed all carriers to charge as of November 15th, 1991.</text>

            <text syncTime="1094.709" offset="4521606">The conference report on ISTEA makes clear that there were two purposes in... in Congress's mind when it drafted the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3236.687" offset="13089561">Our suggestion is that the more appropriate place for it to be subject to further litigation, if there is to be further litigation, is in this agency proceeding with an appeal to the Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.601" offset="13129162">But... but you are correct that it was not expressly addressed by the Michigan Supreme Court in this... in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3263.200" offset="13195618">Either way, the State clearly changed the rule that it was applying.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.420" offset="13208470">It had a clearly articulated rule consistently applied that trucks based in certain places would not be subject to fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.587" offset="13233130">It is now changing that rule and it's therefore trying to collect and charge fees as to those trucks that it did not charge before or collect before, and we think that is clearly precluded by the statutory language and is certainly decided by the ICC adversely to Michigan.</text>
