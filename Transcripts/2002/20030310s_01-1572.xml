            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="85221">The opinion of the Court in No. 01-1572, Cook County Illinois versus United States ex rel Chandler will be announced by Justice Souter.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="9.526" offset="123255">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.558" offset="143422">The respondent, Janet Chandler, used to supervise a medical research study for Cook County Hospital funded by $5,000,000 grant from the national institute of drug abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.367" offset="186681">Because Chandler believed that the County had violated certain terms of the grant relating to research protocols, she sued the County under the False Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.702" offset="227954">So far as it concerns us here, the False Claims Act imposes civil penalties on any person, those are its words, who knowingly presents a fraudulent claim to the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.338" offset="278527">The Government itself can sue for fraud but a private plaintiff like Chandler may sue also by bringing what is known as a qui tam suit on the Government's behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.115" offset="317606">If she succeeds, she may get up to 30% of the proceeds for herself.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.182" offset="337877">The question presented in this case is whether local governments like Cook County are persons subject to qui tam suits under the False Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.842" offset="380509">In the Steven’s case decided three terms ago, we held that person does not include States.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.505" offset="407154">The Seventh Circuit held that municipalities are nonetheless covered, and in an opinion filed with the Clerk today we affirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.909" offset="440800">The term "person" is not defined in the Act but the word has been in the statutes since it was enacted in 1863.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.926" offset="472878">We have no trouble concluding that the term then included municipalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.947" offset="492940">The common understanding going back at least to Cook’s Institute was that corporations including municipal corporations were deemed to be artificial persons for statutory purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.081" offset="537453">Of course Congress could have given a word a narrower definition than the usual one just described but nothing in the Act's text or history leads us to think that it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.702" offset="579980">We also conclude that nothing in the 1986 amendments to the False Claims Act repealed municipal liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.212" offset="609969">To be sure those amendments raised the ceiling on damages from double to treble damages, the change that the Steven’s case described has turned what had been a remedial provision into a punitive one.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.368" offset="658661">The County argues that because local governments enjoy common law immunity from punitive damages, Congress' adoption of treble damages should be read as implied repeal of municipal liability, but the punitive nature of the treble damages under the Act is modest and it therefore offers only limited support for the argument that Congress must have repealed the Act in so far as it covered municipalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.124" offset="769629">To the contrary, the clear purpose of the 1986 amendments was to strengthen the Government’s hand in fighting all fraud which local Governments are capable of committing when they receive and administer federal funding.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.921" offset="820829">We conclude that municipal liability existed under the original False Claims Act and that the 1986 amendments did not implicitily eliminate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.360" offset="858654">The opinion of the Court is unanimous.</text>
