            <text syncTime="1601.171" offset="6561879">We think it's an irrational reading of the act that has no support in the language or the legislative history or the purpose of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2925.499" offset="11859198">The only three cases in which the... the CDA has been applied to national park concessions are the three IBCA cases mentioned, and in two of those, the Government wound up winning on the merits, so there was no prejudgment interest paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.477" offset="11911129">So it's only in that R&amp;R Enterprises case that the Government would have paid any prejudgment interest in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.072" offset="11937565">If I could just go to your example, Justice Kennedy, about the building of buildings on national parklands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.325" offset="11958568">I believe that is not a procurement for... for a variety of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.076" offset="11973510">First, just as a statistical matter, 78 percent of concessions contracts do not involve any capital improvements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.573" offset="12003498">And that is a very broad term.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.897" offset="12008827">It's much broader than just structures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.309" offset="12014470">It's structures, unremovable property, and fixtures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.198" offset="12026068">But on the merits, many concessions contractors have been required, since the very beginning of the... of... of concessions, 1872, to require... they've been required to build their own buildings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.320" offset="12070476">And historically that has not been considered something that the Government gets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.897" offset="12084791">It doesn't get the benefit of those services because it enters the contracts not for purposes of getting a building, but because it wishes to have concessioners provide services to park visitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.935" offset="12120945">And in order to do that, it tolerates the building.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.448" offset="12130976">The National Park Service doesn't want buildings in the parks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.042" offset="12141425">It wants nature in the parks, and it tolerates the buildings to the extent that they are used to provide visitor services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.279" offset="12162323">And I think this comes across in the way these are treated by the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.024" offset="12173294">Even though the Government has bare title in these buildings, in a very real sense it doesn't buy them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.962" offset="12201088">Every concessioner who builds a building in the national parks under a concessions agreement will have a leasehold surrender interest equal to the construction cost of the building plus inflation minus depreciation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.157" offset="12245810">And they cannot be put out of that building by anyone until they are paid that leasehold surrender interest; that is, until the building essentially is bought.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.247" offset="12274231">As long as a concessioner is operating out of that building, a concessioner will hold the leasehold surrender interest, not the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.649" offset="12299831">Also, I think it's telling that the form contract indicates that if the concessioner ever leaves the... ever abandons the building, ever... that they have constructed, that the Government can require them to knock it down and restore the site to its natural... its natural state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.214" offset="12358137">That's section 9b of the standard contract and in the contract that it's in the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.876" offset="12376736">So again, that's an indication that they're not interested really in procuring the construction services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.131" offset="12393768">They're interested in authorizing a concessioner to provide services to visitors to the national parks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.911" offset="12416860">Finally, I think it's noteworthy that Congress obviously knew that concessioners would be building buildings under the 1998 act, which was enacted against the backdrop of this regulation setting forth the Park Service's consistently held view that concessions contracts are not procurement contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.199" offset="12486032">And far from displacing that view, they actually seem to embrace it both in the text of the act and in the legislative history that Justice Breyer mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.718" offset="12520096">As far as the text of the act goes, I think it's telling that... the different types of language they use for both the concessions side of the house and the procurement side of the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.614" offset="12551652">On the concessions side, they use distinct language that I don't think you're going to find in any procurement statute anywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.963" offset="12573072">Instead of saying procure or purchase, they say they... the... the Park Service can authorize concessioners to provide services, and it even specifies that the services will not be provided to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.431" offset="12614972">It says they're provided to visitors, which is obviously very different from procurement statutes, many of which specifically state that the service will be provided to the agency.</text>

            <text syncTime="3144.378" offset="12734718">It says that the... that the service can enter into management consultant agreements whereby management consultants provide services to assist the Secretary in administering the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.975" offset="12773170">So it's a contrast both... I think in both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.152" offset="12785813">Finally, one other thing that I think is telling is that Congress specifically provided that some of the most likely to arise disputes under the act, including specifically franchise-free disputes, which I think people would think would... would arise frequently, would be subject to mandatory arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.243" offset="12846208">And if Congress had thought there was an administrative remedy for this under the CDA, I just don't think there would be any need for them to provide for an... a mandatory arbitral remedy.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="3244.147" offset="13133869">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.042" offset="13141392">The complaint... the complaint in this case was filed under the authority of 28 U.S.C. 1491(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.430" offset="13170963">The Court will find that at page 13 of the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.888" offset="13180785">And that... that statute provides for district court jurisdiction to adjudicate challenges to the terms of proposed Government contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.514" offset="13207325">And I think if you look at paragraph 62 and 114 of the joint... of the complaint, which is in the joint appendix, you'll see the allegations that were made in the complaint to fall within that provision of... of title 28.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.354" offset="13258630">As to the substance of the CDA claim, the Government makes much of the fact that no, quote, Government funds were used here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.354" offset="13290603">And I cannot stress enough that that is a phrase that they've invented for the purposes of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.575" offset="13311501">It makes much of the fact that the concessioners received monies here from the visitors to the national park, remit some of it to the NPS as a franchise fee, and keep the rest of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.050" offset="13353402">But these contracts could just have easily been structured so that the NPS got all the money in the first instance, kept some of it as a franchise fee, and paid the rest of it back to the concessioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.718" offset="13396138">And in fact, some Government concessions contracts are written that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.175" offset="13405960">In that case, even the Government, I think, would have to concede that Government funds were used.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.638" offset="13423828">We can't believe that the CDA coverage of the CDA, these important procedural and substantive protections, turns on such flimsy determinations as to who gets the money in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.537" offset="13467400">Now, secondly, we... we've already talked about the fact that so many services are being provided here that are for the use and benefit of the Government, as well as for the visitors of the national parks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.623" offset="13503763">But I also want to point out that the Government is the sole beneficiary of the contractual provisions in virtually every concessions contract requiring the construction, repair, and maintenance of facilities in the national parks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.816" offset="13552455">You know, if the Court will look, for example, at page 96 of the joint appendix, which is a... a provision of the Grand Canyon contract that's in the record, you'll see there that this contract... under this the contract, the NPS is there procuring maintenance, repair, housekeeping, and groundskeeping for all concessions facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.361" offset="13622672">It seems to us if you look at the language of that... of that procurement and compare it to section 3(a)(3) of the CDA, which... which provides that CDA coverage for contracts for the procurement of construction or repair or maintenance of real property, it's impossible to conclude, I think, that this procurement contract doesn't fall within the CDA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.974" offset="13697173">Thank you.</text>
