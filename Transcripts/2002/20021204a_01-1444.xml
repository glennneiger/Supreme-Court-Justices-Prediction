            <text syncTime="11.600" offset="194190">Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="44.377" offset="325221">The Ninth Circuit held in this case that petitioner Ben Chavez could not assert a qualified immunity defense to a section 1983 lawsuit alleging that his interrogation of respondent violated the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.436" offset="389482">We believe that ruling to be mistaken.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.574" offset="402021">First, there was no constitutional violation at all on these facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.025" offset="423859">But second, if there was a constitutional right implicated, that right was not clearly established in the particularized sense required by this Court's qualified immunity cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.542" offset="469939">Officer Chavez could not reasonably have known that what he was doing violated that right, and the judgment of the Ninth Circuit should, therefore, be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="125.041" offset="647885">And I'm saying, well, assume the... the facts I've just granted, including an assumption that the... it would have been a constitutional violation to use the evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="134.246" offset="684770">--Well, I think... I think the... the answer is that while... while he might have believed that the Constitution would in time be violated, because he could not himself violate it, he couldn't... he couldn't be liable under section 1983 for committing a Fifth Amendment violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.558" offset="765959">So the point is you don't even get to the question of clearly established if there's no established constitutional violation at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="210.451" offset="989567">That is to say, we will let you assert it in what is concededly, for example, a civil litigation setting, a simple deposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.593" offset="1018093">No one would suggest that that is a use in a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.474" offset="1033661">But we allow you to assert it because if we didn't, it would compromise your ability to ensure that the right is protected later.</text>

            <text syncTime="301.517" offset="1353818">It says that your right is not to be a witness against yourself in a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.718" offset="1374612">I suggest, Justice Kennedy, that the result... that the holding in Murphy against the Waterfront Commission is inexplicable if you believe, as the Ninth Circuit does, that it is sufficient simply to coerce an otherwise incriminating statement because in Murphy against the Waterfront Commission, the holding of that case is that the State court was correct in requiring the witness to testify even though there wasn't a statute that protected him against incrimination because the Fifth Amendment itself provides the fail-safe that if you are coerced into giving an otherwise incriminating statement, it cannot be used against you.</text>

            <text syncTime="2730.375" offset="11069279">And obviously the officer is not going to use leading questions, coercive questions to get information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.980" offset="11095715">The basic concept of getting information under those circumstances is you want it to be trustworthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.469" offset="11117658">You don't want the officer putting words into the person's mouth and brow-beating them to come up with something that's a bad lead.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.413" offset="11141377">So obviously we want to have the kind of questioning that would be, in fact, seeking the truth as opposed to putting words into someone's mouth as what occurred in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.271" offset="11184845">The... I'd like to address a point that's been raised, and... and it may not be totally necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.989" offset="11215670">I'd just like to make the distinction that the... the basis, the entire heart of the discussion that coercion is somehow permissible unless the cases are introduced into a criminal case or into a criminal trial are... are the... the immunity cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.853" offset="11291111">In the immunity cases, they... they... I believe that the defense has... or that the petitioners have totally confused the grant of immunity and coercion in a public trial after a grant of immunity where a person is told, you must answer the questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.822" offset="11359030">And... and the distinctions is one is an inquisitional situation where if the officer has a person alone and they're forcing them to answer questions, there is no public trial, there is no judge there to make sure that they're... they're not being... there is no overreaching, there is no brow-beating.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.551" offset="11437919">The person who was even under a grant of immunity can say, I'm not going to talk, and face the consequences of going to jail and sit in jail with dignity and say, I'm not going to talk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.690" offset="11486507">I believe that it's more important to assert my right not to speak than to be... than... than sitting in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.838" offset="11511062">Our law still doesn't allow the court or the jailers to use coercion to extract their statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.929" offset="11543454">A person in this country still could have the dignity to say I don't want to speak and I'll take the punishment, and if it's just punishment, that it's been done by a court, then that is not coercion, the kind of inquisitional coercion that this... that this Court and the United States has always said we don't tolerate.</text>

            <text syncTime="3236.884" offset="13095232">Let me just quickly make a couple of points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.169" offset="13116444">It seems to me that petitioner can win this case the hard way or the easy way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.255" offset="13132744">The easy way is recognizing that this body of law is, as one of the members said this morning, a complex of constitutional issues with cross currents that cut in a variety of directions, that in light of Verdugo Urquidez, in light of Sacramento against Lewis, it cannot be said that any of these constitutional principles was sufficiently clearly established to warrant the rejection of qualified immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.692" offset="13230546">But I want to win it the hard way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.855" offset="13239115">First, because under Sacramento against Lewis, the standard for substantive due process is intent to harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.451" offset="13269521">That wasn't pled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.754" offset="13274746">That wasn't tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.869" offset="13279239">There's no such argument before you today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.098" offset="13288120">No one thinks that if Sacramento against Lewis applies, there can be a substantive due process claim at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.695" offset="13318527">That's why it wasn't in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.553" offset="13325946">And no one here before you is suggesting intent to harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.358" offset="13337126">Now, on the Fifth Amendment, Justice Kennedy, I'd like to take one more crack at the concern that you've articulated because I think it is... it is in fact possible to square those concerns with the holding in Murphy against Waterfront Commission which, as far as I can tell, is perfectly good law and consistent with what this Court said in footnote 8 of Balsys about the fail-safe of use immunity provided directly by the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.357" offset="13445168">So long as the government has not compromised the availability of use immunity under the Fifth Amendment, there hasn't been a Fifth Amendment violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.047" offset="13487905">In each of the penalty cases that are suggested by your hypothetical, that's what the government has done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.280" offset="13512878">They have said to the witness, you may not have immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.169" offset="13524372">You may not assert your Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.110" offset="13532208">If you assert your Fifth Amendment right, we're going to put you in lock-up right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.925" offset="13547464">The Court has consistently said, you know, if you forfeit the use immunity and actually put a guy in jail because he insists on it, that's as good as use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.537" offset="13581841">That's a protection that stems from the Fifth Amendment itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.374" offset="13597201">And that's... that explains all of the so-called penalty cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.280" offset="13620816">The police... the Garrity case in New Jersey, the two Lefkowitz cases out of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.702" offset="13642550">That explains... what is, in fact, going on there is someone is being punished or penalized for the assertion of a privilege, including the right against use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.642" offset="13686331">But as long as the fail-safe in the words... Justice Souter, that you used in... in footnote 8 of Balsys, as long as the fail-safe of use immunity has not been compromised, as it has not been in this case, there is not yet a full Fifth Amendment violation, which can only happen when there's a use in a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.562" offset="13773998">And that is exactly the point that this Court in Verdugo Urquidez said in the passage that the Ninth Circuit decided to call dictum and ignore.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.656" offset="13822377">That was a big mistake.</text>

            <text syncTime="3445.671" offset="13930419">What you... what I think it would... what I think... what I think it would amount to is continued coercion of a statement which arguably at some threshold, once you cross it, does indeed become too coercive to render the statement admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.456" offset="13997606">But that's when the Fifth Amendment fail-safe steps in and says, you may not use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.508" offset="14017773">That would violate the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.341" offset="14029057">But because the fail-safe wasn't compromised in this case, as it was in the line of cases suggested by Justice Kennedy's hypothetical, there cannot be a Fifth Amendment, and we don't even have to reach the question of qualified immunity.</text>
