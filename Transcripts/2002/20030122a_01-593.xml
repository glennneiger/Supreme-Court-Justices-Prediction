            <text syncTime="2176.317" offset="8857256">Ever since 1824, when Chief Justice Marshall announced Mollan against Torrance, the rule has been that jurisdiction is determined as of the date of filing the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.278" offset="8901037">The Chief Justice asked, what is the rule in diversity cases?</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.791" offset="8915143">Well, since Anderson and Watt in 1891, diversity cases have been held to be... to be governed by that rule, and the response we hear is that this is a Federal question case, but, of course, even Federal question cases are governed by the familiar rule that the date is given by the... the filing of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.555" offset="9002183">That's... United States against Keene Corporation in 1993 reflected that principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.125" offset="9028410">And as Justice Ginsburg noted, even if some parts of the act are a Federal question, it's also telling that in 1332(a)(4), Congress created a new species of diversity jurisdiction, so accepting the petitioners' argument here would lead to the anomalous situation where there's a diversity part of the statute that's going to be governed by the Mollan against Torrance rule, and there will be a Federal question part of the statute that would be governed by a different rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="2263.197" offset="9204789">Either way, there's an anomaly, and it appears to us the simplest way to resolve it would simply be to adhere to the longstanding principle that the date on which the complaint is filed is the relevant time to take a snapshot.</text>

            <text syncTime="2621.578" offset="10638284">Congress enacted the FSIA against the backdrop of venerable corporate law principles, including the principle that a parent corporation and subsidiary are distinct, and that the shareholders of a parent corporation are not the shareholders of a subsidiary corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.585" offset="10702337">We submit that the FSIA refers to share ownership in that familiar legal sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.375" offset="10725429">Viewed in that light, a foreign State's majority ownership of the shares of a parent gives the foreign State control over the subsidiary, but it does not give that foreign State ownership of the subsidiary's shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.468" offset="10789795">If Congress had intended that the FSIA would extend agency or instrumentality status to the foreign State's control of the subsidiary, it could easily have said exactly that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2676.066" offset="10856250">It's... and that's... we have... that's why we have a difficult problem, so I wondered, with the language, and nobody accepts... I just want to know the reason for this, and I'm sure it's not a tenable interpretation, because nobody's advanced it, but if you look at the first part, literally speaking, it says a foreign State includes an instrumentality of a foreign State, and so an instrumentality of a foreign State, is, among other things, a corporation, the majority of shares of which the foreign state owns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.791" offset="10983101">And that's true as to the first corporation in the tier, A. Well, now, since A is included in the term, foreign State, it therefore is a foreign State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.010" offset="11035973">That's what it says.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.411" offset="11041615">And therefore, B is a company whose shares, the majority of which are owned by a foreign State, and so forth down the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.804" offset="11079127">Now, literally, that's what it says, and so what's wrong if I can't think of any reason why they'd want a difference, and the... that language literally covers it, what's wrong with that?</text>

            <text syncTime="2815.821" offset="11415271">First of all, Congress was drawing a bright line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.545" offset="11426138">We think that Congress wanted to avoid litigation over where to litigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.173" offset="11444632">Nothing's more wasteful than that... and by doing so it spoke to ownership of majority of shares in the traditional legal sense, which provides a very bright line rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.073" offset="11484234">We also think that this... this reading must be... must take into account that we're not speaking solely of the interest of foreign nations, but also of the interest of American litigants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.917" offset="11535643">Congress was trying to strike a balance between the two, and the balance that we suggest here is one that recognizes that American litigants have an interest in a clear delineation of who is entitled to foreign sovereign status and who is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.439" offset="11601680">We think our interpretation reflects both of those concerns.</text>

            <text syncTime="2882.321" offset="11681197">We think other ownership interest refers to something that is an alternative to shares, such as, as Justice Kennedy has described in ownership in... in a joint venture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.246" offset="11728949">We don't think that Congress intended to complicate the inquiry by making inquiries into whether something that is sometimes described as control should be treated as a different type of ownership interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.837" offset="11779313">We think that here, that what Congress was seeking was clarity, and the interpretation that we're providing is designed to provide that clarity for foreign nations and for American litigants as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.125" offset="11824453">Now, we think it's important to remember that Congress drew this line with the understanding that foreign instrumentalities is a narrow term, particularly as used by foreign nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.036" offset="11880146">Foreign nations by and large would not provide immunity to corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.297" offset="11897178">We believe that Congress took the step of extending it to a first-tier corporation, but concluded that that is where the line should be drawn, it should go no further, and we think a narrow construction of this term is also appropriate in... in the face of the fact that Congress is granting a special privilege, a comity-based privileged, that not ought to be extended beyond what other foreign nations recognize in applying their immunity laws to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.299" offset="11997174">This is particularly so when the construction that we urge is very likely to lead to foreign friction with other nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.436" offset="12029671">Because, as... because foreign nations do not recognize the immunity that's being sought here in their own courts, it's very unlikely that they will object to our recognition of nonimmunity on the same basis in our courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.290" offset="12089125">Now, even if this Court concluded that the FSIA granted agency or instrumentality status to subsidiaries, the Dead Sea companies would still not qualify because, as noted before, they did... did not have that status at the time that this suit was brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.968" offset="12147849">We think that the diversity statute model provides the appropriate test here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.472" offset="12165821">Diversity jurisdiction is predicated on whether or not the parties are diverse at the time the suit is brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.886" offset="12191525">It's based on the status of the parties.</text>

            <text syncTime="3160.588" offset="12794327">First, with respect to the phrase, ownership interest, Mr. Massey suggested that the issues here, and I believe Mr. Minear as well, are related to the issues in the recently decided Meyer case, with which I confess I'm not familiar, but I think also the Bestfoods kind of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.306" offset="12869142">We think those cases are very different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.160" offset="12876560">Those cases relate to liability-creating statutes and, in the context of a statute that creates liability, whether Congress intended for traditional rules of corporate veil-piercing to be eased somewhat in assigning liability in the case of the Superfund law to the... to the owner of the contaminated facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.831" offset="12947300">This is not a statute that gives rise to liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.466" offset="12957853">It defines a category of entities that are within the scope of the... of the group that Congress intended to... to vest with a certain limited protection when they will be sued in... in the United States, namely, a broad right to a Federal forum, and so forth.</text>

            <text syncTime="3217.164" offset="13020652">We... we have always construed jurisdictional statutes quite narrowly, going all the way back to Strawbridge against Curtis, that said you have to have complete diversity under the diversity statute, and it seems to me you're asking for something different than that here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3239.281" offset="13109050">I think there is some interesting language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.828" offset="13115215">I... I believe it's the Delta case of the Sixth Circuit, or maybe the Texas Eastern case in the Third Circuit... talking about why, in the context of this law, there actually should be a broad interpretation of diversity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.041" offset="13160146">Really, that's just another way of saying because Congress intended to bring within it a certain defined category of... of entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.874" offset="13191493">I think it's very hard to... to articulate a reason why Congress would have wanted to bring commercial operations of foreign States within the scope of the statute and say... let me back up a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.386" offset="13241543">There was a time when Dead Sea Works was the immediate parent of Dead Sea Bromine, and Dead Sea Works was owned by the State of Israel.</text>

            <text syncTime="3311.335" offset="13397338">I... in terms of ownership interest, I think it's... it's a well-known and widely used phrase in our law as well as others to be a generic broadbased term.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.776" offset="13443104">We did a little research on some publicly available information just to try to find companies that I think we can say are well-known to be... have certain relationships, and I think it's fair to say, based on news articles and so forth, that General Electric Company is widely understood to own NBC, the broadcasting network.</text>

            <text syncTime="3413.680" offset="13806624">In fact, the only comment in their brief about this is to note that there have not been frictions in foreign relations as a result of the extant state of the law, and the extant state of the law is really in our favor on both points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.309" offset="13857197">There are a number of cases where privatized entities have been held to be agencies or instrumentalities, and certainly where tiered entities have been, so we think it really is a matter of an analysis of the legal opinions about statutory construction and... and whether--</text>
