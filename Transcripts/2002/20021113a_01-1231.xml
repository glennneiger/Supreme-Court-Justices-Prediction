            <text syncTime="242.955" offset="1118518">We agree... and I must say very emphatically we agree so far as the issue of stigma is concerned... that the implication as reached by the Second Circuit is correct, that is, that every person on this list is more likely than the average person to be currently dangerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.618" offset="1209215">We think that implication is true.</text>

            <text syncTime="353.340" offset="1560092">And the reason, if I may presume to say it, may be that the effectiveness of treatment may be problematic, and the same is true with hearings on dangerousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.652" offset="1605336">The unreliability of these hearings has been a very, very substantial problem, and the kind of information that may come to the public from such hearings or from information about treatment may be as misleading as it is accurate in many instances.</text>

            <text syncTime="431.941" offset="1874502">So there seems to be a... a category, not merely a set of individuals who may prove they're not dangerous, but a category that is presumptively not dangerous in the sense that the others are.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.541" offset="1920895">And yet, there is no way for them, in effect, to... to get themselves declared ineligible for the... for the stigmatization that... that goes on.</text>

            <text syncTime="3308.355" offset="13380082">So how can something that you say you're not seeking to disturb or at least you're not challenging the district court for not disturbing it is the plus?</text>

            <text syncTime="3319.872" offset="13426162">Remember, my understanding of the stigma plus test is that it was meant to distinguish just plain defamation cases from those which really were Fourteenth Amendment claims based on something the government was doing to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.587" offset="13477049">The plus here is that the government requires you, on pain of felony conviction, to provide the personal information that then is published.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.132" offset="13511217">It is an integral system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.535" offset="13516859">It creates a new class of citizen, a second class of citizen, which has different obligations from other citizens and from which information, personal and otherwise private information, is extracted and then posted.</text>

            <text syncTime="3379.416" offset="13664399">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.874" offset="13682162">Following Justice Ginsburg's question, there really is no plus here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.870" offset="13702224">The point is the registry has not been challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.213" offset="13715599">The registry existed before the posting, the publication, making this information available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.901" offset="13742348">It exists now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.015" offset="13746737">If the order were not in effect, even without the requirement in the law that there be Internet publication, an ordinary citizen could do what The Hartford Courant did and file an information... Freedom of Information request.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.133" offset="13803266">The Internet requirement is like a Freedom of Information form of law, and it is unrelated in the way that Paul v. Davis says it must be related to the supposed stigma.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.076" offset="13863034">Even if this Court were to find there's a defamation... and by the way, Connecticut law has never recognized defamation by implication.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.590" offset="13893023">But even if there were, Paul v. Davis says that as a result of the action complained of, a right or status recognized previously under State law must be distinctly altered or extinguished.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.937" offset="13958433">In this instance, there was no pre-existing right not to register.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.395" offset="13976301">In fact, individuals... sex offenders were required to register, and that obligation continues to exist afterward.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.485" offset="14008693">And so what this Court would do by accepting the Second Circuit's decision is, in effect, to constitutionalize tort law in the way that it has declined to do in Paul v. Davis, Siegert v. Gilley, where again it insisted on some causal link between the defamation and the supposed loss of right and status.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.492" offset="14112660">And that is utterly lacking here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.349" offset="14120079">The supposed harms... there's nothing in the record about housing, employment, any other harm that results from this supposed stigma, and the stigma itself, to go to the Chief Justice's question, has to be false in order to constitute defamation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.668" offset="14197401">This Court said so in Codd v. Velger, and that is plainly not true here because all of this information, particularly as to the convicted offense, is absolutely truthful and leaves to Connecticut's citizens to make the judgment about whether or not it indicates dangerousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.042" offset="14286845">The disclaimer... to clear one other point... very specifically says not only that no assessment has been made, but also that the publication or inclusion of this individual on the website and on the registry is not to be deemed a judgment or a conclusion that this person is dangerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.049" offset="14390916">There's a specific disclaimer as to dangerousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.135" offset="14407217">But even without it, we would contend there's no stigma because all of this information is very simply public record information, and under Siegert v. Gilley particularly, there is no sufficient link between the supposed stigma and any loss of right or status.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.055" offset="14494884">There simply is no plus here as this Court has interpreted it to exist and must exist under the standard that this Court has set forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.540" offset="14536889">We would respectfully submit that at the very least, the plus, or the loss of right or change of status must arise out of the same action or flow from it in some way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.350" offset="14600105">And here plainly the information that's conveyed accurately and truthfully on the registry does not in any way cause the registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.547" offset="14640856">It does not result from the registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.724" offset="14653604">The registration continues to exist now and would continue to exist even after the Internet is taken off... is... come down because of the court order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.099" offset="14707103">So we respectfully submit that the court should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.814" offset="14721940">Thank you.</text>
