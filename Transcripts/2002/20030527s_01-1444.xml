            <text syncTime="6.471" offset="111199">Fisrt case I have to announce is Chavez versus Martinez, No. 01-1444.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.102" offset="145785">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.029" offset="169504">While respondent Martinez was being treated for gunshot wounds received during an altercation with police, he was interrogated by petitioner Chavez, a patrol supervisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.570" offset="215584">At no point was Martinez given Miranda warnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.265" offset="230422">Although he was never charged with a crime and his answers were never used against him in any criminal proceeding, Martinez filed a 1983 suit claiming that Chavez violated his Fifth Amendment right not to be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself and as Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process right.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.843" offset="316730">The Ninth circuit affirmed the District court's ruling that Chavez was not entitle to qualified immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.957" offset="345152">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand for further proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.780" offset="372423">Chavez is entitled to qualified immunity as to Martinez's Fifth Amendment claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.441" offset="395098">While the majority of the Court remands as to Martinez's Fourteenth Amendment claim, the Chief Justice, Justice Scalia and I would conclude that Martinez's Fourteenth Amendment rights were not violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.772" offset="444417">The opinion is joined by the Chief Jjustice in full, by Justice O'Connor as to parts 1 and 2A and by Justice Scalia as to part 1 and 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.210" offset="482138">Justice Souter has filed an opinion, part 2 of which is for the Court and is joined by Justices Stevens, Kennedy, Ginsburg, and Breyer, and part 1 of which concurs in the judgment and is joined by Justice Breyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.858" offset="536786">Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in part in the judgment; Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part; Justice Kennedy has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part which Justice Stevens joins in full and Justice Ginsburg joins as to part 2 and 3.</text>
