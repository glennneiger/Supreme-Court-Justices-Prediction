            <text syncTime="458.955" offset="1985835">And the second basis... Justice Stevens, the second basis that we think was wrong in... in the concurring opinion is where she finds that you have to look at the extras for the child first, over and above current maintenance, and that we submit to you is in... contrary to the Federal regulations themselves, 20 C.F.R. 404.2040, which expressly provides that you look first to the current maintenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.961" offset="2089803">That's the very purpose behind both Title II and Title XVI, first to the current maintenance, and then you guess... within the broad discretion accorded a representative payee, you may look to see if there are extras to which those monies could be spent.</text>

            <text syncTime="977.343" offset="4059331">There is no question that the use of Social Security benefits to pay for current maintenance needs by a beneficiary or by a parent as representative payee is permitted under the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.082" offset="4118367">There is no reason that the identical use of funds would suddenly become a prohibited alienation of Social Security benefits just because it's done by a State as representative payee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.547" offset="4168209">The anti-alienation provision of the Social Security Act prohibits the use of judicial processes or similar coercive processes to divert funds away from meeting the needs of a beneficiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.605" offset="4232470">But there's nothing in the text or the purpose of the anti-alienation provision that supports the Washington Supreme Court's conclusion that it prohibits particular types of payments and expenditures of funds that the representative payee provision of the statute specifically permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.462" offset="4311883">And that is because... it's very important to understand that when a State serves as a representative payee, it does not receive funds, and it does not spend funds as an interposing claimant or creditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.465" offset="4363814">Instead, under the Social Security program, it steps into the shoes of the beneficiary.</text>

            <label>Ms. Teresa W. Roseborough</label>
            <text syncTime="1592.416" offset="6519647">Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.556" offset="6532186">I think the Court's questions have hit on the key issues here, and I'd like to point out what I believe to be the errors in the State of Washington and the United States' analysis in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.959" offset="6573878">I agree with Ms. Millett that the Social Security benefits that the State receives as representative payee on behalf of these children indeed belong to the children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.125" offset="6610554">And in its role as representative payee, the State essentially steps into their shoes to use the benefits to serve their best interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.738" offset="6640960">The regulation-mandated transfer from a State trust fund account, which is the account in which the State deposits the children's funds when they are received, to the State treasury occurs in the State of Washington because of the operation of the State statute and two regulations, one superseding the other, that mandate that the State shall use those benefits to reimburse its previously advanced costs of care.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.793" offset="6761123">There's a singular exception in the regulations that permits a State to advance costs of care to a Social Security disability recipient and then later seek reimbursement out of the paid disability benefits for that care, and that is found at 42 U.S.C., section 1383(g)(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.008" offset="6846074">That provision specifically provides an exception to the operation of section 407(a), and provides that where appropriate agreements are in place between the State and the commissioner of Social Security and between the State and the individual, that a State may advance costs of care in the period between the application for benefits and the date on which benefits are received and then seek reimbursement out of the Social Security funds for that period of interim assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.865" offset="6961430">Apart from that exception, the use of Social Security benefits to reimburse previously avanced costs of care or public assistance is the payment of a debt within the meaning of the Social Security regulations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1731.266" offset="7075115">So the State is paying for that immediately, directly.</text>

            <text syncTime="3579.935" offset="14469754">To the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.845" offset="14473411">The complaint all the way along has suggested a 407 violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.765" offset="14489084">She further suggests that R.C.W. 74.13.060, the statute in question here, is mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.195" offset="14518759">To the contrary, it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.053" offset="14526178">It allows the State discretion to use Social Security benefits for the special needs of a child and to reimburse the State which is precisely what occurs in this particular instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.282" offset="14571109">I ask you to return to the question presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.914" offset="14585633">Is there a violation of 407(a) in this case because a duly designated representative payee, supervised by the Social Security Administration, is using the monies for the current maintenance of the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.628" offset="14636519">The plain reading of 407(a) to that question is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.541" offset="14656163">With that, we would ask you, respectfully, to reverse the decision of the Washington State Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.485" offset="14679987">Thank you.</text>
