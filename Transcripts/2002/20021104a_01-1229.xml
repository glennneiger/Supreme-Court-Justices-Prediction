            <text syncTime="43.705" offset="324930">However, soon after the 1973 Highway Safety Act made accident data collection a condition to Federal hazard elimination funds the Secretary of Transportation reported to Congress that States strongly objected, because they feared that their collection of accident data would be used against them in damage actions.</text>

Chief Justice Rehnquist's question, how does the county say the statute should be interpreted, pretty much we agree with the logic of the United States Solicitor General, but just would suggest that the, their logic be extended to what we believe is the logical conclusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1435.872" offset="5893505">In the same way, the process of applying for Federal highway funds and the documents that are used for that purpose have an inherently Federal character, and so the Federal Government has an interest in making sure that the information provided to the Federal Government is accurate and complete, and it has an ability, Congress has the power to take those essentially Federal documents and protect them both in State and Federal court litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1954.573" offset="7968359">At that point, I think it's clearly a final decision, because this Court has held in the Beckton Dickinson case in the context of section 1291 that the fact that attorney's fees need to be resolved on remand doesn't deprive a decision of finality, and in that decision this Court relied on 1257 decisions, and so I would think that the same rule would apply in both contexts, so I think that the PDA action clearly is final.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.442" offset="8059788">I think the tort action is a more difficult question as to whether that's final.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.072" offset="8078387">I think this Court might have to change its... to modify its precedents a bit, but I think it might be a wise course in light of what Congress has done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.101" offset="8114436">I think this case is quite analogous to a case that this case found final called National Mercantile Bank v. Langdow, and in that case there was a State venue provision that a Federal statute trumped, and the State supreme court found that the... this Court found that the State's decision saying that State law trumped the Federal statute was final, and I think the cases are quite parallel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.723" offset="8216940">They both involved congressional efforts to modify State procedure in order to serve a Federal interest, and in both cases when the State court disregarded the Federal interest and either through constitutional means or statutory means found the Federal statute inapplicable, this Court found that there was a final judgment in the Langdow case, and I think by extension of that decision, they could find a final judgment here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.467" offset="8311921">I think the main difference between this case and Langdow is that in Langdow this Court took the position that upon remand there would be no further litigation available in the State court where the lawsuit was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.418" offset="8355703">Here, there might be some litigation that would go on in the tort action, for example, but I think the important thing is that the Federal interest has been extinguished, and I think if there's any play in the joints in this Court's finality decisions, I think that this would be a particularly important case to find a final decision, because an act of Congress has been held unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="3165.161" offset="12810730">Justice Ginsburg, I have two responses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.286" offset="12819193">One, I think actually this Court addressed that same sort of analysis in New York v. U.S., where the Solicitor General argued that because New York officials wanted the benefits of the Low-Level Hazardous Waste Act, therefore it cannot later challenge certain provisions of that act, and this Court rejected that argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="3193.618" offset="12924519">And that goes... then to my second part of my response is, and I think it's a fundamental part of the constitutional analysis, because here, if the States wanted this protection they had the means to do it themselves, and this Court has explained, again citing from New York v. U.S., State sovereignty isn't for the benefit of the States, it's for the benefit of the citizens to derive the benefits of liberty from the division of separate powers, so it really, just because State officials want it, it's clearly that the people of the State of Washington did not want this, because it infringed upon a State cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.310" offset="13115317">In fact, so much so that the State supreme court was willing to hold it was unconstitutional.</text>

Justice Kennedy, my response is, I don't see how the State could, because I think just for the very reasons, as was pointed out by the Solicitor General, where do you cross that line between, I guess, a single waiver, and then it becoming endemic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.351" offset="13315520">I think that's the whole problem here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.122" offset="13322521">Under the recent cases under the Commerce Clause, and again I just want to spend a couple of minutes on the U.S. v. Lopez and Morrison cases, it seems clear that again this type of activity, what's being regulated is, in fact, State courts, in fact, the admissibility, the discovery of evidence, and that is certainly intrastate, and there's no contention here that somehow justice, or the discovery of documents is somehow commercial in nature, and you cannot make that argument, so I think there is no basis under either the Spending or the Commerce Clause to support this legislation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3355.911" offset="13573714">I don't think the same thing can be said about 409, because then you're becoming... as this Court said in U.S. v. Lopez, you're building inference upon inference, because you have to go and say, if these documents are no longer, in fact, discoverable, would it result in safer interstate travel, and there's just too many intermediate steps.</text>

            <text syncTime="3627.960" offset="14661871">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.332" offset="14661766">Very quickly... 3 minutes, quickly... I would like to correct I think what was a misstatement by respondent's counsel, or at least one of them, dealing with what the Court should do if it adopts the United States' position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.940" offset="14661662">Plaintiffs say that if you adopt that position, then they get the documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.584" offset="14661557">I'll point out that on page 24 of their own respondents' brief they say their... interpretation number 2, which they say the U.S. reflects, they say on page 24, if the Court construes the statute in this fashion, then a remand would be necessary to determine which specific discovery requests would be precluded and which would be, still be allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.807" offset="14661453">They're not entitled, even under their own admission, under the U.S. position, and in fact I would point out on page 20 of our reply, yellow brief, where we point out that in fact, if that were the case, even if the U.S. position were adopted, these particular documents would have to be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.983" offset="14661348">Furthermore, obviously there is some confusion as to where we differ with the United States, and it's a very narrow difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.718" offset="14661244">We both agree that generated documents are protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.343" offset="14661139">We both agree that collected and compiled documents in the hands of Public Works are protected, and we both agree that in some situations they're protected in the hands of third parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.600" offset="14661035">They, though, very narrowly define that in situations where the third party gets it, is a transferee agency, where you can only get it by indexing, or where it's part of a computer base.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.585" offset="14660930">I would ask the Court to consider its own St. Regis Paper Company case, where it addressed a statute that only made a protection when it was in the hands of third parties or officials, and it contrasted the language of that statute with other statutes, 45 U.S.C. section 41, and 49-320, whose wording is almost identical to 409.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.844" offset="14660826">If you would compare those, you would see that the case distinguished those types of statutes from a statute only protecting in the hands of third parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.210" offset="14660721">So whatever 409 does, it certainly protects more than just in the hands of third parties, and I would also like to point out, the reason why we differ from the U.S., we believe their logic is correct with protecting in the transferee hands and in a computer data base and where it's indexed, but if you carry that logic through, we believe a bright line rule should be established by this Court, because obviously the State courts have been very... some State courts, a minority of State courts have been very resistant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.179" offset="14660617">Other State courts have been trying to do their best to comply with the language of the statute, but some States, of course, have found every opportunity to try to misinterpret the statute, and it required Congress at least twice to amend the statute to get back to what they intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.116" offset="14660512">When you look at the situation of why they wanted, the Solicitor General believed that documents in the hands of the transferee agency are protected, they said that the reason for that was that they would not exist but for the planning agency's collection of that information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.223" offset="14660408">Well, so, too, accident reports would not exist in their totally different form, they would not be indexed and therefore accessible, and they would not be in the county's possession but for the Highway Safety Act, so you extend that logic through, then you come to a bright line rule which we believe the Court should adopt.</text>
