            <text syncTime="3397.989" offset="13743685">That is a very small and diffuse burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.493" offset="13753716">It's not one to be minimized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.175" offset="13760404">It's certainly something that the Court has to pay attention to, but this is extremely limited in scope and relative to the benefits to students of all races and to our Nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.940" offset="13803453">It has to be weighed in the balance and this Court certainly should conclude that the interests that are being served, the legitimate interests that are being served are sufficiently compelling to allow this kind of limited consideration of race.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kirk O. Kolbo</label>
            <text syncTime="3492.293" offset="14120893">Thank you, if I may follow-up on the last question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.297" offset="14128939">Counsel's answer to the last couple of questions, I think, really crystallizes the difference between their position and ours.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.132" offset="14156211">The University of Michigan sees this as a question of group rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.442" offset="14169481">There are rights on the part of minorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.370" offset="14177213">And there are rights... there are rights on the part of whites and Asians and other... other groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.353" offset="14197066">We see it very differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.548" offset="14201873">The Constitution protects the rights of individuals, not racial groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.391" offset="14221308">The Bakke case opening up 16 spaces in the class when that system was struck down meant that about 2,500 students, 2,500 to 3,000 students who had previously been discriminated against now had an opportunity to compete for those seats.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.412" offset="14285360">So it seems to me the question is not answered by how many have been discriminated against.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.902" offset="14303333">The question is whether in fact discrimination is occurring against the individual and it certainly is in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.127" offset="14324230">Counsel was asked some questions about the open-ended nature of the policy at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.837" offset="14343039">And I think it's very critical that we understand that if the interests that they are asserting here to be compelling is upheld as compelling by this Court, we have in fact the first indefinite, ongoing, unlimited compelling interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.741" offset="14402702">The Court previously has confined its analysis to remedying... remedying identified discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.796" offset="14426839">A remedy based on societal discrimination or a role-model theory for example in Wygant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.548" offset="14453902">A couple of the reasons that the Court struck down those rationals was because they were so unlimited, so amorphus, indefinite with respect to time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.899" offset="14483264">That certainly is the case with the interest that is being urged here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.027" offset="14503848">And it seems to me that that is... it becomes very clear in the University's argument that what they've done... and they didn't argue so much this in the lower court, but they made it very clear that their justification for the preferences is based in effect on remedying societal discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.421" offset="14573439">Their argument and their briefs and in this Court has been that when the day comes, someday and maybe it will come someday, we hope that it will, that someday that we will be able to stop using race for these purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.348" offset="14617115">And the opinion that accepted that rational it seems to me would be a dramatic step backward from this Court's precedents which rejected the notion that something as amorphus as societal discrimination would be sufficient.</text>
