            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="85438">I have the opinion of the Court to announce in No. 01-1368 the Nevada Department of Human Resources versus Hibbs.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.734" offset="120338">The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 or FMLA entitles an eligible employee to take up to twelve weeks of unpaid leave annually for the onset of a serious health condition in the employee's spouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.464" offset="183240">The Act also creates a private right of action to seek damages against any employer that interferes with restrains or denies the exercise of these rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.932" offset="225141">Respondent Hibbs was formerly employed by petitioner, the Nevada Department of Human Resources; it terminated him when he exhausted his FMLA leave and failed to return to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.436" offset="275087">He has sued in federal District Court in the District of Nevada seeking damages for these violations of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.500" offset="303404">The District Court awarded the Department summary judgment on the ground that the claim was barred by the Eleventh Amendment, but the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.062" offset="341647">We granted certiorari and in an opinion filed today with the Clerk of the Court, we affirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.433" offset="363067">Congress may abrogate the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit in Federal Court if it  acts pursuant to a valid exercise of its power under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.010" offset="409461">Congress would act within it Section 5 authority, we hold when it sought to abrogate the States' immunity for purposes of FMLA's  family leave provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.947" offset="453138">In the exercise of its Section 5 power of Congress may enact prophylactic legislation that prescribes facially constitutional conduct in order to prevent unconstitutional conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.180" offset="502143">Valid Section 5 legislation must exhibit congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented in the means adopted to that end.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.167" offset="546029">The Act aims to protect the right to be free from gender-based discrimination in the workplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.174" offset="570062">When it enacted the Act, Congress have before significant evidence of sex discrimination by the States with respect to the administration of leave benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.183" offset="610081">This evidence is sufficiently weighty to justify the enactment of the prophylactic Section 5 legislation, and the Act's family care provision is congruent and proportional to the targeted violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.338" offset="662744">Justice Souter has filed a concurring opinion in which Justices Ginsburg and Breyer have joined; Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment; Justice Scalia has filed a dissenting opinion; Justice Kennedy has also filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Scalia and Thomas have joined.</text>
