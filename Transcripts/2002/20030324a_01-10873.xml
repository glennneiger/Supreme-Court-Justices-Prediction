            <text syncTime="2158.085" offset="8781626">But to get back to your binding precedent point, which I think is an important one, it's... there's three things to keep in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.923" offset="8804927">First of all, whether this is a binding precedent or not has absolutely no effect on the claims of these individual defendants.</text>

            <text syncTime="2175.425" offset="8850903">It should address, in the first case, the power of this precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.313" offset="8862501">And it's not an issue this Court has never considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.459" offset="8871069">In Glidden... the Glidden Company case, the two concurring Justices specifically said... they... they agreed that the court was competent at least... it was an Article III court... after... at least after Congress had passed the statute giving them that status.</text>
