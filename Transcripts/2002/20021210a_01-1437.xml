            <text syncTime="14.944" offset="209999">For 40 years, ever since the decision in Baker versus Carr, State court judges, like Federal judges, have played a role in addressing constitutional problems stemming from malapportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.915" offset="257855">This was reflected in Scott versus Germano in 1965, and again in Growe versus Emison in 1993 when the Court said not only that State judges play a role, but they are preferred to Federal judges as agents of reapportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.519" offset="320236">In this congressional redistricting case from Mississippi, the Chancery Court of Hinds County, acting with the blessing of the Mississippi Supreme Court, stepped into the breach and adopted a plan when the legislature defaulted.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.407" offset="367779">That plan has been enjoined by the Federal district court, and the United States Department of Justice has said not once, but twice that it was postponing the statutory time period for preclearance under section 5 of the Voting Rights Act so that even now, nearly 1 year after the plan was adopted and submitted, no preclearance decision has been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.896" offset="461715">A Federal court order is in place telling State courts they may not hear congressional redistricting cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1877.574" offset="7660435">The reason why 2c was enacted, and the way to give 2c some effect is that Congress at that time was faced with a situation where there were at least six courts that had threatened to order at-large election of entire congressional delegations in the aftermath of Baker against Carr.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.501" offset="7720203">And Congress responded to that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1911.904" offset="7797839">It seems that the Court is focusing on the question of preclearance here, and the real problem with the question of preclearance is that the Justice Department has stopped the preclearance process because of the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.795" offset="7861369">Now, we believe that the Justice Department acted properly in so doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.882" offset="7877669">They have a regulation that says, we will not consider premature submissions, and this Court said in Georgia that any reasonable regulation will be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.541" offset="7916331">Their position is that whenever the State has been told it cannot administer a change, then it cannot be seeking to administer a change within the meaning of section 5, and therefore, this was premature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.947" offset="7974009">So they stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.350" offset="7979547">Now, the question is what can be done about that, and I think, in all probability, the only thing that can be done about that is for the Attorney General of Mississippi to go down the street to the district court and ask them to preclear the change under section 5 because there does not seem to be any other mechanism whereby anybody can force the Justice Department to get moving on a section 5 preclearance.</text>

            <text syncTime="2064.681" offset="8408895">You'd say ground two is, A, premature, doesn't really support the issue, it's an injunction... because it's premature, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.649" offset="8440765">And now you'd have a decision that, I guess, from a legal point of view insofar as we were right about that, would just rest on the ground that it hasn't been precleared.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.482" offset="8476082">And since that's the only reason for issuing the injunction, then the Department, if the State of Mississippi wants to put the plan in effect, would preclear it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2534.930" offset="10289921">So those two issues were already before the Justice Department when the district court wrote.</text>

            <text syncTime="2553.611" offset="10364631">So it's unusual, but it's certainly well within the... the scope of what the district court was being asked to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="2984.250" offset="12087145">We have a long history over the last 20 and 30 years in Mississippi of coming up with remedies which will protect the rights of minority voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.653" offset="12128837">The most common remedy since Gingles is to do single-member districts, but it's not the only remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.801" offset="12153392">And there are remedies where you can elect people at large and because of the way the election is held, all people running together, not requiring majority votes, not having... not having anti-single-shot requirements, those have worked in Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.687" offset="12220892">Minorities have been elected in white jurisdictions in multi-member races by using those sorts of procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.867" offset="12249627">Congress didn't tell us what sort of procedure to use in an at-large election, and in Young v. Fordice, this Court made clear that whatever procedures you use would have to be precleared.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.064" offset="12290482">I don't think the legislature will act for all of the reasons we've seen, but the district court would certainly use those remedies.</text>

            <text syncTime="3092.529" offset="12520255">And under the Supremacy Clause, ordinarily a State court must litigate Federal claims, and this Court recognized their authority to do so in Growe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.817" offset="12557454">Here, for whatever reason, the plaintiffs in the... in the chancery court who are intervenors in this Court did not assert a Federal claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="3308.427" offset="13383864">That was the order of the Mississippi Supreme Court, however brief it was, saying the chancery court's plan will remain in effect until... unless superseded by a timely plan of the State legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.315" offset="13431407">The Attorney General submitted the plan for preclearance under order by the chancery court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3329.808" offset="13469441">The statutory language is not... is not whether it's in effect or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.523" offset="13484278">It's whether he's seeking to administer it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3336.291" offset="13495354">And... and there's nothing about the absence of the appeal here, particularly where we are taking the appeal, that suggests he's not seeking to administer it, Justice Scalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.238" offset="13535165">And let me mention one other thing along those lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.179" offset="13542897">The language is enact or seek to administer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.689" offset="13556899">Now, the lesson of Growe v. Emison, at least we think, is that a State court stands in the shoes of the legislature when the legislature defaults on redistricting, and certainly if the legislature had enacted this plan, and the... it had been enjoined by the Federal court for whatever reasons, and the Attorney General had not taken an appeal, but legislative leaders had or intervenors had, I don't think we would say that the preclearance submission was thereby withdrawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.675" offset="13668912">It seems to me the State court is in no different position, and we shouldn't say that the Attorney General's failure to appeal here would withdraw the submission where it wouldn't in the legislative context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.192" offset="13714992">The... and... and the plan has been precleared in our view, if not the... by the first 60 days, certainly by the time of the second 60 days, where the Justice Department said, we're not going to continue to review this plan because of the constitutional injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.789" offset="13781343">Well, there's no language in section 5 that stops the 60-day period from running on that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.855" offset="13805584">That... it is a statute that admits of no exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.570" offset="13820422">There is no regulation that allow... by which the Justice Department says, we will not continue to... to consider a... a plan that has been enjoined on constitutional grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.368" offset="13871622">And in fact, the Solicitor General has not even said in his brief that that is the regular practice of the Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.653" offset="13892833">Here there are compelling reasons why it is important for the 60-day period to be removed even if there's a constitutional injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.055" offset="13934420">Often these cases are decided under severe time constraints.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.430" offset="13951870">If a constitutional injunction is imposed, State officials may try to remove it as quickly as possible and restore the plan in time for the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.295" offset="13991367">If the section 5 obstacle is delayed in the meantime, the... it... it, in effect, prolongs itself by feeding off the constitutional injunction, and even if the constitutional injunction is vacated, the State still has to deal with this now-postponed section 5 obstacle that will not be removed in some situations in time for the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.700" offset="14084990">Let me say one other thing about the constitutional ruling, the fact that it was an alternative ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.009" offset="14114247">We think there is doubt about the section 5 ground, as we've suggested here, and particularly given the importance of resolving these cases so that elections can go forward without continued Federal court interference, I think it is crucial for this Court to rule on the constitutional ground, as well as the preclearance ground here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.300" offset="14203377">The rule of Connor, and the rule of the Warren County case are not jurisdictional rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.327" offset="14227514">They're supervisory rules imposed by this Court to ensure the orderly processing of the section 5 issue when it's... when it's in a case in which other issues are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.740" offset="14273176">Here the orderly processing of this litigation, and the creation of the situation where Mississippi can conduct its elections in 2004 without continued confusion of the type that we had at the last election, that interest favors resolving the constitutional issue now, at the same time the section 5 issue is resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.375" offset="14375681">And so for all of these reasons and the reasons set forth in our brief, we respectfully urge that the Court vacate the injunction of the district court on all grounds.</text>
