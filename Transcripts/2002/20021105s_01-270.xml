            <text syncTime="8.834" offset="120700">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.839" offset="140657">Before 1994, the Interstate Commerce Commission allowed States to charge interstate motor carriers operating within their borders annual registration fees of up to $10 per vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.487" offset="199276">In the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, Congress directed the ICC to create a new system called the Single State Registration System which caps state registration fee by directing the ICC to establish a fee system that would result in a fee for each participating state as equal to the fee not to exceed $10 per vehicle that such state collected their charge as of November 15, 1991.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.056" offset="337516">The ICC ruled that under the new system, the States could not terminate reciprocity agreement that were in placed under the old regime.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.974" offset="373251">To allow State to do so, the ICC concluded it would be inconsistent with the statute's fee-cap provision and what Congress' intent that the flow of revenue for the States be maintained while the burden of the registration system for the motor carriers be reduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.519" offset="443364">We granted certiorari in this case to determine whether the Michigan Supreme Court erred in holding that the ICC's rule is inconsistent with the language of the fee-cap provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.571" offset="495609">We hold that the ICC's interpretation of the Act's fee-cap provision is a permissible reading of the statutory language and reasonably resolves any ambiguity in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.586" offset="543674">We therefore, defer to the agency's interpretation under the principles that established in Chevron U.S.A. versus Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.731" offset="588291">The statute can easily be read as the ICC chose, making that unlawful for a State to renounce and modify a reciprocity agreement so as to alter any fee charge that collected as of November 15, 1991.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.657" offset="663942">Under the ICC's rule, where a State waives its registration fee, its fee collected or charged is zero and must remain zero.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.897" offset="704902">To allow States to disavow their reciprocity agreements that can permit States to increase their revenues substantially, a result that the ICC reasonably believes Congress did not intend.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.182" offset="754012">Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
