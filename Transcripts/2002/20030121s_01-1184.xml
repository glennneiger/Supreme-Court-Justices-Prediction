            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>

            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="11.045" offset="129171">In this case we consider the legal validity of a rule, a Ninth Circuit Rule that they set forth in a Circuit Case called United States versus Cruz.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.577" offset="175355">Cruz said that a criminal conspiracy ends automatically when it becomes impossible to achieve the conspiracy’s objective, when for example the Government prostrates a drug conspiracy’s objective by seizing the drug that its members have agreed to distribute.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.890" offset="248603">The facts of this case in which Cruz was applied illustrate how the rule work.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.720" offset="271904">The police stopped the truck in Nevada and they found a large stash of illegal drugs in the truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.271" offset="306072">So, with the help of the truck drivers, they set up a sting.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.437" offset="322790">The driver has paged the contact.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.492" offset="335016">The contact said he would call somebody to get the drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.414" offset="350689">A few hours later, the defendants in this case, the respondents here they arrived at the scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.219" offset="377856">One of them drove away in the truck, the other followed in the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.068" offset="397292">Now eventually, the defendants were convicted of being part of the basic conspiracy to possess and to distribute the drug.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.581" offset="427385">But the Ninth Circuit following the Cruz rules set aside their conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.199" offset="445775">The Circuit said that once the Government had seized the drugs from the truck in Nevada it became impossible to achieve the drug distribution objective of the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.427" offset="490705">So, the conspiracy ended, and that they said was before the defendants arrived on the scene, so the government could not convict them for belonging to a conspiracy that it ended before they joined it.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.793" offset="540234">Now, that is all sorts of logical but in our view, the Cruz rule incorrectly states basic conspiracy law.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.482" offset="570954">A conspiracy does not terminate simply because the Government unbeknownst to some of the conspiracy’s member has made it unlikely or even impossible for the conspiracy ultimately to succeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.046" offset="625184">This Court has repeatedly said that the essence of a conspiracy is an agreement to commit a non-lawful act, that agreement is a distinct evil; it poses a threat to the public and that threat is not just the substantive crime might occur but also that the conspirators will continue to commit other crimes or similar crimes on other occasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.481" offset="722986">When police have frustrated the conspiracy’s object but the conspirators do not know it, those conspiracy related dangers remain.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.833" offset="760394">So to does the essence of the conspiracy, namely the agreement to commit the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.952" offset="784844">Legal authority outside the Ninth Circuit overwhelmingly supports this view of the law that the Government’s frustration of the conspiracy’s objective does not necessarily prevent prosecution of unknowing conspirators, and in our view, this latter view correctly sets the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.005" offset="861017">So, we find the Ninth Circuit’s Cruz rule erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.265" offset="874078">We reverse the judgment here in so far as it relies upon that rule, and we remand the case for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.551" offset="903231">Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.</text>
