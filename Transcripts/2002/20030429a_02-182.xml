            <text syncTime="8.999" offset="186984">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.090" offset="219376">For some 6 decades now, the policy of the United States has been to embrace integration, reject segregation and separation of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.197" offset="263784">We stand... really, the Nation of the United States of America stands pretty much as the beacon in the world to the notion that balkanization is not the way to go.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.492" offset="296908">Particularly in public affairs and in public life, integration, working together, not separating people on the basis of race is our goal.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.863" offset="334420">This Court started that trend, that great trend, in the early... in the 1940s with the original decisions of Smith versus Allright, putting aside segregation, the past history of that in this country, the ICC, Interstate Commerce Commission desegregation decisions, Brown versus Board of Education, voting rights cases, jury cases, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.233" offset="407876">And the policy of the United States, as this Court was the leader on that at all times, has always been... has been for integration, for treating people the same independent of their color.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.976" offset="446851">Congress followed behind this Court, started adopting some of the early Civil Rights Act in the early 1950s, the more moderate ones, if you will, under... under President Eisenhower's administration, and of course, the great Civil Rights Act of 1964 was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.723" offset="501917">1965, Voting Rights was enacted; and the 1968 Open Housing Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.181" offset="519680">Throughout that entire time, the policy of integration has been the policy that this Nation has embraced and espoused and advocated.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.097" offset="555416">And I would submit to Your Honors respectfully that the State of Georgia... the position the State of Georgia puts before this Court in this case today stands four square in the center of that tradition.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.667" offset="597629">Georgia comes here to this Court today advocating that politics should be open and integrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.354" offset="624379">Politics should not have allocations unnecessarily, in particular, of seats based on race.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.444" offset="656771">I would submit to this Court that what we say is totally consistent with everything this Court has said that touches upon this matter and in this particular regard.</text>

            <text syncTime="161.122" offset="795429">One looks at, first of all, the whole plan and sees if opportunities are the same in terms of majority and minority seats, for example, or opportunities where minorities have a real opportunity get election, and sees whether that, under the whole plan, is the same and whether that's been maintained.</text>

            <text syncTime="1368.348" offset="5624424">And if the status quo is some measure of safety, then the theory of section 5 is preserve the measure of safety because if you don't do that, we know what's going to happen, and what's going to happen is you're not going to get to the line of equality.</text>

            <text syncTime="2505.196" offset="10171820">The district court said at the very bottom of the page, once again we note that it may well be the case that any decrease in African American electoral power in Senate Districts 2, 12, and 26 will be offset by gains in other districts, but plaintiff, namely the State, has failed to present any such evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.858" offset="10262413">So the district court acknowledged in principle that even though black voters' ability to elect candidates of choice in these three districts had been substantially decreased, the State might, nevertheless, be able to prove non-retrogression for the plan as a whole if it presented evidence that there would be offsetting gains in other districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.941" offset="10334720">And the court faulted the State for a failure of proof not for any... not... it didn't suggest that there was a... an analytical barrier to proceeding along that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.663" offset="10381636">So I think the district court regarded this as a relatively easy case precisely because there were meaningful losses in identified districts and no attempt to prove offsetting gains in others.</text>

            <text syncTime="2606.580" offset="10577345">Really, the thrust of the plan was black voters would be taken out of majority black districts and placed in districts that were predominantly white.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.928" offset="10606707">The black percentages would be too low for the black electorate to elect candidates of choice, but it might be high enough that the black vote could swing the balance between a white Republican and a white Democratic candidate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2637.007" offset="10698971">Congress has amended section 2 to facilitate vote dilution claims along those lines.</text>

            <text syncTime="3347.106" offset="13539422">Are they making their districts so weak they're voting themselves out of office?</text>

            <text syncTime="3350.583" offset="13553319">Their testimony is unequivocal that this enhances black voting strength because... and the Solicitor General was wrong when he says there's no testimony that the other districts would be enhanced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.026" offset="13591144">There is no testimony that any other districts would become safe seats, but from a black point of view, absolutely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.964" offset="13618834">When you're shifting the black votes into those other districts, the potential is enhancing, the potential of getting someone the Democrats prefer who happens to be white.</text>
