            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="11.630" offset="131450">This case arises under the Federal Employers' Liability Act in my day called the FELA, a 1908 law still enforced requiring railroads to compensate their workers for injuries caused in whole or in part by the railroads negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.708" offset="215773">The six plaintiffs in the suit before us, respondent's here, are former employees of the Norfolk and Western Railway Company; each suffers from asbestosis, a chronic disease caused by prolonged exposure to the toxic substance asbestos.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.523" offset="287035">We resolved in today's decision, two questions important to the application of the FELA:  First, when a worker is afflicted with asbestosis caused by exposure to asbestos while employed by the railroad, the worker can recover for asbestosis-related pain and suffering.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.898" offset="368537">The question we address is whether that recovery may include damages for fear of developing an asbestos-induced cancer.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.790" offset="412110">The second question concerns apportionment of damages when others not before the Court may have contributed to the worker's injury, for example, prior or subsequent employer or asbestos manufacturers or suppliers.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.486" offset="470833">Is the railroad answerable to the employee or is it immediately entitled to a division of damages limiting its liability to a proportionate share?</text>
            <text syncTime="109.124" offset="521406">The West Virginia State Court in which this case was tried and initially reviewed ruled for the workers and against the railroad on both questions as do we.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.381" offset="566441">Responding to the first question, we followed the path marked by our prior decisions which in turn rest on common law principles and developments.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.588" offset="603221">A worker exposed to asbestos remains symptom free, we recently held, may not recover damages for apprehending that he may someday suffer an asbestos-induced disease, but we have distinguished from fear or anxiety not tied to a present affliction, another category that is tied, fear or anxiety about future harm stemming from an already manifested physical injury or illness.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.832" offset="720250">Emotional distress, falling in that latter category we have observed it is compensible.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.246" offset="745850">Adhering to that framework we hold that a railroad worker suffering from asbestosis can recover for the heightened anxiety he experiences because of his vulnerability to a more dread disease but it will not suffice precaution merely to allege such distress that it is the complainant's burden to prove that the asserted fear is genuine and serious.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.218" offset="849817">On this issue, question 1, the Court is not unanimous.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.102" offset="865282">Justice Kennedy has filed an opinion dissenting on question 1 joined by the Chief Justice, Justice O'Connor, and Justice Breyer; Justice Breyer has also filed a separate dissenting opinion on the first question.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.639" offset="919408">On question 2, the opinion is unanimous.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.746" offset="935917">The FELA's expressed terms allow a worker to recover in full from a railroad whose negligence alone or jointly caused an injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.350" offset="974265">The FELA's text moreover is reenforced by the Act's overarching purpose and by consistent judicial applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.447" offset="1010732">The statute was designed to shift part of the human cost of railroading from employees to their employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.455" offset="1038735">It accords with that design to require the employer to bear the burden first to identify other responsible parties and then to demonstrate in the claim for contribution that some of the cost of the injury should be spread to them.</text>
