            <text syncTime="1748.074" offset="7144357">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: First, I think, in answer to Justice Breyer's question, I don't know what the statistics are under the old indeterminate sentencing law that was in effect in California until 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.117" offset="7192527">But in a way, I think the... Your Honor's question triggers an issue that I think is central here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.955" offset="7219903">The ISL, the old California law, was premised very explicitly on a penological theory that emphasized rehabilitation of the offender.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.749" offset="7259087">I think the question that's raised in this case, and it's a question that's particularly apt in light of the Harmelin opinion, is, When can a state decide that they're going to move away from a more lenient policy of rehabilitation or extending leniency to a first-time offender, and move toward a policy, a tougher policy, of incapacitation?</text>

            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="1803.298" offset="7365249">So, tell me, am I fair to say assume there never, in the history of the United States, has been a person who... of the set... I'm only... I don't want to be pejorative; I want to characterize it your way, and I'll characterize it as taking the set of very serious criminals with very serious records, and a person in that set commits another crime, and the other crime is approximately theft of $1200... and am I fair in saying there hasn't been, ever, a sentence in the history of the United States in the last hundred years anywhere close to this one?</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.183" offset="7516759">And I base that on my knowledge... which you could get; it's public... of 35,000 real cases in the federal system where to get a sentence like this one for a prior offender, you had to... you have to now, you know, hijack an airplane, commit murder, something really serious beyond belief compared to this, and that the worst sentence you could get for something like this is about four, five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.181" offset="7636818">And then I look to the California Adult Authority, and I see, under that sentencing, nobody could have gotten more than ten real years, and, indeed, the average was somewhere around five.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.923" offset="7691779">And you have all those records, and you have come up with nothing in your brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.072" offset="7712364">And therefore, can I say... my assumption is, this is by an order or factor of two or three times higher than anyone ever was sentenced before in the United States for such a thing?</text>

            <text syncTime="2999.570" offset="12150359">Second, we recognize that the states are entitled to adopt different penological theories, or a mix of theories.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.409" offset="12181706">In fact, I would have thought that a state's entitled to say, for example, that certain types of crimes ought to be addressed in terms of retribution; other types of crimes posing other kinds of issues can be dealt with in terms of deterrence and incapacitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.423" offset="12241787">And if the consequence of that principle is that this Court has very limited review on comparability of sentences, at least where we are dealing with sentences that allow for the possibility of parole, then I think the conclusion is that it is the extremely rare case in which a sentence gets--</text>

            <text syncTime="3180.834" offset="12875413">If we look at the record in this case, in the joint appendix, the sentencing judge carefully considered the entirety of the file with respect to the trigger... or the predicate offenses, which involved, actually, three burglaries in the course of a single month, one of which involved pulling a knife and threatening somebody, as well as at least nine prior offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.415" offset="12973738">And interestingly, in no case since 1988 had the petitioner ever successfully completed probation or parole.</text>

            <text syncTime="3279.189" offset="13268818">Because again, you started toward it in responding to me at the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.574" offset="13286372">Like you, I came in here assuming that the State could change its theories.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.037" offset="13304240">If that is so, then I guess what that means for proportionate or gross disproportionality analysis is this: A State can do it and can pass our Eight Amendment test if it has a reasonable basis for saying,</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.401" offset="13381667">"We are going, under certain circumstances, to say there is a change to theory of sentencing. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.659" offset="13410715">"The theory changes from deterrence or mere retribution to a theory or public protection, putting away the person who simply will repeat and repeat and repeat. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.880" offset="13459616">So, for purposes of our proportionality analysis, the question would come down, Do they have a reasonable basis for doing that under their statute, in general?</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.495" offset="13498068">And in particular, is there a reasonable basis for saying that this is a case for that?</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.345" offset="13517399">And if the answers to those two questions are yes, then it passes the test.</text>

            <text syncTime="3352.405" offset="13561702">That's not to say that if it flunks those, it automatically fails the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.903" offset="13579675">But certainly if you meet those conditions, I think you pass the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.237" offset="13593049">And I think there's a common sense to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.586" offset="13602453">One could look, for example, at certain types of violent crimes, like murders and rapes and say, irrespective of whether it was a crime of passion or something that will never happen again,</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.329" offset="13645399">"It is so heinous, our philosophy is we have to punish it. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.878" offset="13659609">But one can also look at comparatively small crimes, at least if they're felonies, and say,</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.714" offset="13682911">"If someone is repetitiously unable to conform their conduct to the requirements of the law, we don't have to wait until he commits the next felony or the next two felonies before we put an end to it. " And interestingly, if one goes back Blackstone, who talks a little bit about the issue of proportionality as it related back in his day, he discusses the fact that when you deal with habitual offenders, it would be cruel to the public to simply allow that person to get out again and commit their next crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.033" offset="13800148">So, I don't know that it's so much that the State changes its theory, as that the State adapts its theory to the particular type of crime and particular type of offender.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.988" offset="13839959">And that's, of course, what we want to have in sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.514" offset="13850094">And, finally, I would say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.510" offset="13858140">In a scheme like California, where the state judge has the power to tailor to the particular offender and the particular offense what the right answer is, for the federal courts to come in under gross disproportionality analysis and recalibrate that... even if, sitting as state trial judges, the justices might feel we would do it differently... would be essentially converting the courts into a constitutional sentencing commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="3553.251" offset="14365020">One thing would be to treat a wobbler, if it is a wobbler, and reduce it to a misdemeanor; so you would go from 25 to life, or life, to one-year maximum penalty.</text>

            <text syncTime="3566.235" offset="14416951">But that's a... the California Supreme Court in Romero said that's a very limited discretion, that it is only when you can find that this offender is outside the "spirit of the law", whatever that is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.092" offset="14468465">And there's an amicus brief filed by the Los Angeles public defender in Romero that shows that that discretion has been used very little in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.049" offset="14504305">So the... this limited discretion has no effect on it.</text>
