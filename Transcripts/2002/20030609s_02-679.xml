            <label>Justice Clarence Thomas</label>
            <text syncTime="9.561" offset="123551">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.711" offset="148106">Respondent was employed by petitioner as a warehouse worker and heavy equipment operator.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.523" offset="171303">In 1996, she filed this lawsuit asserting a claim for sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.307" offset="214457">The case was tried before jury and after hearing the evidence, the District Court gave the jury a mixed motive instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.349" offset="250611">The District Court rejected petitioner's argument that under this Court's decision in Price Waterhouse versus Hopkins, a mixed motive instruction is appropriate only when a plaintiff has presented direct evidence of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.743" offset="312260">A Ninth Circuit panel vacated and remanded agreeing with petitioner that the District Court had erred in giving the mixed motive instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.059" offset="353533">On rehearing en banc however, the Court of Appeals reinstated the judgment holding that there is no heightened evidentiary requirement in mixed motive cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.693" offset="400031">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we affirmed the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.210" offset="422079">Congress amended Title VII in Civil Rights Act of 1991 which provides among other things that an unlawful employment practice is established "when the complaining party demonstrates that sex was a motivating factor for any employment practice, even though other factors also motivated the practice."</text>
            <text syncTime="111.508" offset="531270">Under this new provision, direct evidence is not required.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.106" offset="553631">Direct evidence of discrimination is not required for a plaintiff to obtain a mixed motive instruction under Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.817" offset="584560">First, the statute on this phase does not mention, much less require that plaintiff make a showing through direct evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.931" offset="621027">Title VII's silence on this point suggest that we should not depart from our conventional rule of civil litigation that a plaintiff must prove his case by preponderance of evidence using direct or circumstantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.272" offset="690304">Second, the use of the term "demonstrates" in other provisions of Title VII tends to show further that the term does not include a direct evidence requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.570" offset="731577">Accordingly, because direct evidence of discrimination is not required in mixed motive cases, the Court of Appeals correctly concluded that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in giving a mixed motive instruction to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.663" offset="787897">The opinion of the Court is unanimous.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.630" offset="795734">Justice O'Connor has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
