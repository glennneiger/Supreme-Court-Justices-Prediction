            <text syncTime="97.355" offset="534459">But what's crucial is that those conspirators who remained liable were entirely unaware that the Government had intervened and frustrated the objective of the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.250" offset="546057">And I think that the hypothetical that makes clear why the Ninth Circuit went wrong is the instance where the Government enters the market in a reverse sting operation and goes into the market as a seller, offering to sell drugs, and a collective of individuals decides to pool their resources and arrange to purchase the drugs that the Government is offering.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.214" offset="569986">It is highly likely that the Government has no intention and never had any intention of delivering actual drugs.</text>

            <text syncTime="110.792" offset="588271">Yet, it's settled in the Ninth Circuit and elsewhere that the conspirators can still be held liable because their agreement to perform an act which, under the facts as they understand them, would be unlawful.</text>

            <text syncTime="117.410" offset="614707">The traditional Federal rule is that in an attempt, you need the intent to perform the illegal act, plus a substantial step towards its completion.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.891" offset="624634">The law of attempt has always required a little bit more activity on the part of the defendant before the Government can intervene and penalize it.</text>

            <text syncTime="366.642" offset="1611644">Courts have worked out a multi-factor test to determine whether you have one agreement or two agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.370" offset="1618541">And it focuses not on literal identity of membership or complete chronological co-existence of the participation of each conspirator, but whether there's a common agreement which each is seeking to advance forward in his own way and whether the excess of one is dependent on the efforts of the others.</text>

            <text syncTime="377.132" offset="1653649">That is the conspiracy in which respondents were involved as substitute couriers brought in to move the truck from the Karcher Mall in Idaho to its ultimate destination.</text>

            <text syncTime="396.491" offset="1731076">And the settled law on variances is that it is no defense for a defendant if the proof varies from the conspiracy charged in the indictment so long as the conspiracy that's proved up is within the scope of the indictment, a lesser included conspiracy, so to speak, and the defendants suffer no prejudice from the variation.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.753" offset="1760124">Now, in this case, everyone knew from the outset that the centerpiece of the Government's proof against respondents was going to be the observation of them driving up after the call was placed to the Arizona supplier of the drugs and getting into the truck and driving the truck away down the highway in Idaho, following which they were stopped and gave completely unbelievable stories about what they were doing driving around with a truck filled with drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.933" offset="1796800">There was no prejudice to the defendants in defending against a conspiracy that was proved up based on the events of the 18th because those events were always going to be at the heart of the Government's proof that they were liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.506" offset="1815086">So absent a showing of prejudice, the variance between the allegations of the indictment and the proof at trial does not warrant any relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="429.374" offset="1862524">What the Ninth Circuit relied on was its holding in Cruz which is that a conspiracy ends when the Government intervenes and renders its completion impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.171" offset="1873809">And the Ninth Circuit, therefore, reasoned that respondents could not have joined the conspiracy alleged in the indictment because that conspiracy was, as a factual matter, over.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.015" offset="1885094">Accordingly, the only way on the Ninth Circuit's view that the Government could win this case is if the Government showed that respondents joined the conspiracy before the seizure of the drugs, or if they were involved in a broader conspiracy that involved other drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.911" offset="1900768">Only under those two assumptions did the Ninth Circuit think that the Government could prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.359" offset="1906514">And the Ninth Circuit held that the evidence was not sufficient to prove either of those other conspiratorial activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.197" offset="1913829">It never questioned that the evidence was overwhelming to prove a conspiracy to participate in the distribution of drugs on November 19th, when respondents showed up and got in the truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.666" offset="1927726">And because the Ninth Circuit was wrong in its holding that a conspiracy terminates when it becomes factually impossible of accomplishment, the rest of its analysis also crumbles.</text>

            <text syncTime="942.678" offset="3915749">The Government suggests that if we allow this decision to stand, that it would cause irreparable injury and damage to the ability of the Government to prosecute crime, to catch people who are miscreants, and that it would make inordinately difficult the choices of the prosecutor in determining what and how to charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.271" offset="3958172">We would suggest simply that that's the obligation of the prosecutors now.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael R. Dreeben</label>
            <text syncTime="957.063" offset="3973323">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="957.948" offset="3976875">To address the jury instruction issue first, the jury in this case was instructed in accordance with the requirements of Cruz, and therefore, the jury was asked to find whether there was evidence of respondents' involvement in the conspiracy before the seizure of the drugs or, alternatively, whether they were involved in a broader conspiracy, not limited to the drugs that were seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.991" offset="4001012">At pages 6 through 8 of our reply brief at the petition stage, we addressed the consequences of what happens if this Court should conclude that the Cruz legal rule is incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.587" offset="4015432">And in essence, our position is that any rational jury that found guilt under the Cruz instructions also would have found that respondents were involved in a conspiracy to distribute the very drugs that they drove to the Karcher Mall to pick up.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.114" offset="4033509">That was the centerpiece of the Government's evidence, that respondents were involved in a conspiracy, and the fact that the jury may have found that respondents were involved in a longer conspiracy, or in other conspiracies wouldn't detract from the rationality of its necessarily concluding that the respondents were also involved in this conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.055" offset="4057332">Even if this Court didn't agree with that rationale or chose not to reach it, it's important to note that the effect of the Ninth Circuit's holding is to find insufficient evidence to prove the crime charged in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.908" offset="4072692">That doesn't leave the Government with the option of pursuing a new trial on correct instructions with the Cruz findings purged from them.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.183" offset="4081783">It would mean that respondents have permanent immunity from the crime that's charged in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.930" offset="4088784">If this Court were to conclude that Cruz is wrong, and either this Court or the Ninth Circuit also concluded that the jury instructions somehow prejudiced the defendants, the remedy would be a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.193" offset="4101845">It is also important, I believe, to note that the... the principle that the Ninth Circuit has adopted would go contrary to what this Court has noted about the evolution of conspiracies.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.939" offset="4116787">In a case called Blumenthal versus United States, which we did not cite in our briefs, but it appears at 332 U.S. 539, the Court noted that conspiracies involving elaborate arrangements generally are not born full-grown.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.328" offset="4134341">Rather, they mature by successive stages which are necessary to bring in the essential parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.936" offset="4140820">And in this case, two essential parties were brought in not at the inception of the conspiracy, but after events that the conspirators were aware of required that new couriers were brought in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.371" offset="4154612">They were not aware that the Government had seized the drugs, but they knew that they needed new couriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.716" offset="4159941">They brought them in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.980" offset="4160986">Under the principles of Blumenthal, that's all one conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.060" offset="4165270">Respondents' counsel has mentioned the Model Penal Code provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.404" offset="4170704">The Model Penal Code at section 5.01 addresses the question of impossibility under attempt law and concludes that the defense should not be recognized and at section 5.03 does the same for conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.667" offset="4187736">Finally... thank you.</text>
