            <text syncTime="86.458" offset="490335">The double jeopardy question presented in this case is whether the statutorily mandated judgment of life that was entered in David Sattazahn's first capital trial is, as a matter of Federal constitutional law, a judgment that precludes the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania from seeking and obtaining the death penalty in a second capital trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.484" offset="578420">Pennsylvania was afforded one fair opportunity to sentence Mr. Sattazahn to death, and the jury in his case decided, in accordance with the trial court's instructions, in accordance with the verdict slip, in accordance with the law of Pennsylvania, to report to the court the presence of circumstances that it knew would compel the court to impose a life sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="216.890" offset="1012052">The traditional hung jury case, the lack of... when there's an absence of unanimity what happens is, the trial court discontinues the proceedings and jeopardy never terminates, and the proceedings are sent back to start over.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.122" offset="1072970">Here, as a matter of Pennsylvania law, the legislature determined in advance, saw the possibility of a nonunanimous jury as one of the foreseeable outcomes of the trial and in so doing it said, well, if that happens, what we're going to do is say, the State only gets one chance.</text>

            <text syncTime="369.014" offset="1620601">In so doing, what the Pennsylvania legislature determined was that unless... unless the prosecution was able to prove its case for death, that is, that aggravating circumstances outweighed mitigating circumstances, and was able to prove its case for death unanimously, then the outcome would be a life sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1009.384" offset="4182064">Justice Breyer, it's not like a hung jury first because in the hung jury cases, the jury fails to reach a decision and, as a result, the trial court then discontinues the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.165" offset="4257192">A hung jury does not result in the entry of a judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.988" offset="4280493">In a hung jury situation, the case gets sent back and the prosecution then has the opportunity to decide whether it's going to proceed with a retrial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1046.741" offset="4331484">It's not a hung jury because 1) it does not produce a mistrial, it produces as a matter of law an entry of judgment, and that judgment is a... what we would say is a... a judgment of acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.785" offset="4391670">The reason it's a judgment of acquittal is because this Court has made clear in the context of Bullington, it's made clear in the context of Rumsey, and even in Monje v. California and Casperri that there is something fundamentally different about a capital sentencing proceeding that has all the hallmarks of a trial of guilt or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.348" offset="4481949">There's something fundamentally different about those proceedings from any other sentencing proceeding and, because of that, because a capital sentencing proceeding is the functional equivalent of a trial on the issue of life or death, and because the State has additional burdens of proof, additional evidentiary requirements, the sentencing phase is, in effect, the functional equivalent of a greater offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.615" offset="4598978">Because of these factors, when a defendant emerges from a capital sentencing proceeding, tried to completion, submitted to a jury and, after the deliberations are done and the law operates, comes out of this with a sentence of life, that life sentence is an acquittal of the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.815" offset="4691765">Now, because of that--</text>

            <text syncTime="1153.699" offset="4759370">You're giving it a different label because Pennsylvania law precludes the claim, but the two juries have done precisely the same thing, so... and the difference between this case and Bullington, of course, is that there was a determination, a fact determination by the fact-finder for life rather than death.</text>

            <text syncTime="1230.688" offset="5067301">Then the judge instructed the jury to take a look at the verdict slip in the case, and the verdict slip... which contained language in bold capital letters that were mandated by the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure... the verdict slip also told the story the same things, and told the jury that if it could not reach a unanimous verdict, it was to report that to the court, and if the court found two facts, 1) that they were not unanimous and 2) that they were not going to be unanimous, the court would have the duty to impose a life sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1728.796" offset="7059713">We would say that Pennsylvania arbitrarily deprives a defendant of this life and liberty interest if it conditions his appeal... if it conditions the enforcement of that right... upon giving up the right to appeal a lesser and distinctly different offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="2954.795" offset="11963732">The question in this case is whether Pennsylvania's imposition of a default sentence of life imprisonment by operation of law when the jury in a capital sentencing proceeding is unable to reach a unanimous verdict constitutes an acquittal within the meaning of the Double Jeopardy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.059" offset="12028725">We think the answer to that question lies in the settled rule that a hung jury is not an acquittal for double jeopardy purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3313.148" offset="13397123">But this case is different in a significant respect, because here, Pennsylvania law draws a distinction between a unanimous jury verdict and a hung jury that results in the imposition of a life sentence, and petitioner had the opportunity to obtain a unanimous jury verdict, and, in fact, when the jury initially past its note to the judge indicating that it had reached an impasse, petitioner immediately moved for declaration of a mistrial and discharge of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.435" offset="13506315">And in that situation it's clear under double jeopardy law that when the defendant invites the declaration of a mistrial and the discharge of a jury, there's no double jeopardy prohibition against the State's conducting a retrial or, in this case, the State's conducting a new sentencing proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="3517.394" offset="14214129">There are three reasons why a State might choose not to conduct a resentencing in the initial round of proceedings, but nonetheless to resentence in the event of a retrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.717" offset="14247357">First, as an interesting closure, the State might determine that after a capital trial and a capital sentencing hearing, at that point, it makes sense to accept what is still a substantial punishment, the imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment, but if the defendant occasions a new trial by successfully appealing his conviction, at that point the balance of considerations changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.092" offset="14336905">And in particular, in terms of the second reason, if a State were to conduct a new sentencing proceeding immediately after a hung jury in the initial round of proceedings, the sentencing jury would come to the new sentencing proceeding without having had the benefit of standing through... of sitting through the capital trial, and the State might reasonably conclude that at that point, it would have to retry much of the underlying case on guilt or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.529" offset="14434602">By contrast, when the defendant occasions a new trial by successfully appealing his conviction, the State will have selected a capital jury to conduct the trial, and the new capital jury will come to the sentencing proceeding entirely familiar with the facts and circumstances of the case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert B. Dunham</label>
            <text syncTime="3595.313" offset="14525822">Your Honors, I would just like to make a couple of points in rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.340" offset="14585904">The first issue I'd like to address is the question of the State's interest in closure, and the policies, the way the double jeopardy policies work out in this statute in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.075" offset="14652777">What Pennsylvania... Pennsylvania's statute as it's written recognizes several different interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.066" offset="14684751">One of the interests it recognizes is the interest in economy, the interests in finality, the interest in giving the State a single opportunity to try and obtain a death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.464" offset="14746400">On the other hand, it balances this against what this Court has in the past said is a desirable goal of trying to achieve jury unanimity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3661.815" offset="14791749">So it has a preference for a unanimous jury, and it balances that against the finality of the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.759" offset="14815572">And that's why the judge is required, when the jury comes back and says that it is not unanimous, why that judge is then required to see if further deliberations are going to be fruitful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3680.557" offset="14866772">When the judge determines that the jury is not unanimous, and determines that the jury is not going to become unanimous, that represents a decision at that point that the interest in finality, imposing the life sentence now and ending it, outweighs the interest in obtaining a unanimous jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3700.619" offset="14947020">And that is... and that triggers, that ties into this Court's long-term double jeopardy jurisprudence that one of the primary interests is against subjecting a defendant to multiple trials, forcing him to run the gamut of a second capital sentencing proceeding after the first has been tried to completion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3722.744" offset="15035523">On another issues, Your Honors, one of the things that I would suggest as a possible structural way of looking at capital sentencing cases to see whether there is a sensible way of determining whether or not what you have is an acquittal is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3742.163" offset="15113159">In Bullington, this Court talked about the binary choice between life or death, and the significance of that when you have a trial-like proceeding, in distinguishing between whether it's an acquittal or a conviction, so there's a binary choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3757.628" offset="15175017">What the Pennsylvania statute has done is create a second binary choice, only it's a procedural one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3764.316" offset="15201767">If this were a hung jury like what you see at trial, the jury has three options.</text>
            <text syncTime="3772.528" offset="15234681">They can acquit, they can convict, or there's limbo.</text>
            <text syncTime="3777.979" offset="15256415">The hung jury in the case goes back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3780.041" offset="15264669">The Pennsylvania legislature has determined that there is a second binary choice... a procedural choice... and that is, unless there is a conviction, a life sentence is entered, and by eliminating that third category, it has made the determination that any failure by the State to prove its case to a unanimous jury constitutes an acquittal, so I would say that the second binary choice, the procedural choice, is a bright line way of saying whether or not there is an acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3814.593" offset="15402909">And a bright line, I think, is what Bullington and Rumsey stand for--</text>
