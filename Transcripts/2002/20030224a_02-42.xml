            <text syncTime="1568.132" offset="6417494">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.139" offset="6449468">In our federal system, it's recognized that the states will sometimes have overlapping jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.735" offset="6479875">When that happens, the Constitution allows each state to apply its own laws against the background principle of comity where they believe it would be appropriate to defer to the laws of another state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.936" offset="6536613">And I submit that the Nevada courts here have applied these principles very carefully.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.963" offset="6560750">Nevada, of course, correctly held that they were not required to apply California's legislative-created law of immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.879" offset="6596485">At the same time, however, they have applied principles of comity to strike out the declaratory judgment count that would have gone to the very issue that is being contested in the Florida... excuse me... in the California tax proceeding, which is the date that Mr. Hyatt moved to Nevada.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.803" offset="6664090">And they have also given California complete immunity for any negligence that it has committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.945" offset="6692721">So in this case, it seems to me, the system is working--</text>

            <text syncTime="1674.347" offset="6842350">So I don't think that the Full Faith and Credit Clause itself speaks to that issue, but I do think principles of comity will traditionally reach that result.</text>

            <text syncTime="1782.049" offset="7273161">--Well, there are two... two factors there, Justice Kennedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.392" offset="7286536">First of all, there is the fact that Nevada has some very real interests of its own, its own sovereign interests to protect here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.444" offset="7318719">I mean, there have been torts which were both committed in Nevada and directed at a Nevada resident.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.881" offset="7344423">So, to begin with, before one gets to the immunity question, Nevada, as a sovereign state, has important interests in assuring compensation and also in deterring that kind of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.564" offset="7391130">So the idea that a legislatively created immunity by another state should be able to prevent Nevada from protecting those interests seems inconsistent with the federal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.453" offset="7438778">Now, if one goes beyond that to the question of inherent immunity, the very idea that a state should have to be subject to sue in the courts of another state, I think, first of all, as you know, we don't believe that issue is properly presented on the question presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.748" offset="7507950">But if you would like me to address it just for a moment, I think there... there are differences if one looks to the... to the way that the... essentially immunity has been resolved in... in the course of... of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.435" offset="7570644">First of all, in its own courts, it has the common-law immunity based on the idea that it is both the king being sued in its own court, and also typically it is also the progenitor of the law, so to speak, to Justice Holmes' point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.442" offset="7638667">In the United States, there's... the courts of the United States, there's a very specific situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.348" offset="7662281">At the time of the convention, the states were, obviously, forming a new sovereign, and the question of whether that sovereign was going to grant them the immunity they had in their own courts or whether that sovereign would be in the same position essentially as foreign sovereigns typically were, which is that they did not have to provide sovereignty except as a matter of comity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.277" offset="7754023">That's The Schooner Exchange opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.490" offset="7762905">But... so the states, at that point, had a very real interest in deciding that question, and they did, in fact, decide that question, as the court has recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.521" offset="7803029">That is not true with respect to the immunity that they have had in the courts of other states.</text>

            <text syncTime="2508.527" offset="10179023">I mean, there have been two cases before this court involving suits against states in the courts of other states.</text>

            <text syncTime="2529.582" offset="10263241">And, for example, under the Full Faith and Credit Clause for years, as the Court may know, there is a doctrine that said that states didn't have to enforce the penal laws of another state, even though Full Faith and Credit, on its face, would make you feel that maybe they would have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.321" offset="10322174">But, in fact, states eventually began, through reciprocal agreements in decisions, and I think in legislation also, saying, you know, we essentially will enforce the penal laws and the tax laws of other states, so long as they do for us.</text>

            <text syncTime="3402.037" offset="13753096">In this particular case, I'd like to go back to Justice Breyer's thumbscrew example.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.016" offset="13796982">I don't think the Full Faith and Credit Clause would actually force Cal... force Nevada to apply... apply a California thumbscrew statute, because that would actually be outside the tax function.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.133" offset="13853406">What I'm saying in this particular case what has happened is that Nevada's failure to give us back to California's immunity statute has resulted in interference with California's tax system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.063" offset="13909204">If this court does not intervene and give us back to our particular proposed test, which would look into California to see whether or not we would grant immunity, then essentially that would permit any defendant any form of taxpayer to run to the border and literally sue the State of California or any other state to prevent the enforcement of that particular statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.028" offset="14005021">In addition, I pointed out that this gives another state the power to intrude into the actual operation of another state, and that's what has happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.660" offset="14055594">There has been some... some discussion as to whether or not Nevada has legislative jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.570" offset="14095196">We concede that they have legislative jurisdiction over the tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.309" offset="14106167">But we... what we complain about is that they won't respect our legislative jurisdiction or our tax process over our immunity laws, and that is our particular complaint.</text>
