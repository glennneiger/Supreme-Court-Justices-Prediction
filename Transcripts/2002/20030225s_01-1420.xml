            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="85113">The opinion of the Court in No. 01-1420, Washington State Department of Social and Health Services versus Guardianship of estate of Keffeler will be announced by Justice Souter.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="11.487" offset="130984">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.367" offset="150524">The State of Washington through the petitioner Department of Social and Health Services pays for foster care by providing funds to those who in turn support children removed from their parents custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.920" offset="204754">The Department also receives and manages two kinds of federal Social Security benefits on behalf of these children and acting as what federal law calls the representative payee or trustee for many of the children as it is permitted to do under the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.910" offset="280718">Under Washington State Law the Department generally uses a foster child's Social Security benefits to reimburse itself for the funds that has already dispersed to the foster care providers.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.437" offset="334844">The respondents who are beneficiary children for whom the Department serves as representative payee file this class action in State Court alleging that the Department's use of their benefits to reimburse itself violates 42 United States Codes Section 407(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="80.674" offset="407777">That Section the so-called anti-attachment provision of the Social Security Act protects social security benefits from what the law refers to as execution levy attachment garnishment or other legal process.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.718" offset="471934">The State Trial Court agreed with the beneficiaries that the state reimbursement violated that Section and enjoined the Department from continuing to reimburse itself for foster care costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.676" offset="519791">The Supreme Court of Washington affirmed concluding that because the Department's reimbursement scheme involved what it called creditor type acts, it involved a form of other legal process prohibited by 407(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="125.966" offset="588963">In an opinion filed today with the Clerk of Court we reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.057" offset="605263">Because the Department's activities do not involved execution levy attachment or garnishment before specific procedures prohibited by 407(a), the case boils down to whether the Department's use of the benefits involves other legal process.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.552" offset="675271">Although the term other legal process is potentially broad, the statute uses the term restrictively for underestablished rules of interpretation, words in the statute are known by the company they keep.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.208" offset="729920">Thus other legal process should be understood to be processed much like execution, levy, attachment, and garnishment and would seem to require at least some quasi-judicial mechanism by which control over the property passes through one person to another in order to secure discharge of a liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.636" offset="811631">This definition is confirmed by the Social Security administration's own interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.907" offset="836708">Applying the definition, it is apparent that  the Department's activities do not involve legal process.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.639" offset="863666">The State has no enforceable claim against its foster children and the Department's scheme operates on funds already in the possession and control of the Department held on terms that allow the reimbursement.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.156" offset="925733">The Department's reimbursement method is permitted under the Social Security administration's regulations and its interpretations of those regs to both of which we owe deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.700" offset="971813">In the final analysis, the beneficiaries argumented and the State Supreme Court's holding rest on the view that permitting the Department to reimburse itself for cost it would otherwise bare, violates provisions in the Act and the regulations that require a representative payee  to use Social Security benefits in the best interest of the beneficiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.974" offset="1060943">Although it is true that the State could not directly compel any other representative payee to pay benefits over to the State, that fact does not render the Department's reimbursement practice antithetical to the beneficiary's best interest within the meaning of the Act and the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.692" offset="1131787">For instance, under her authority the Commissioner of Social Security has read the open ended term best interest in light of the Act's basic objectives to provide for a minimum level of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.142" offset="1181629">Thus, she has decided that a representative payee serves the beneficiary's interest by seeing that basic needs are met not by maximizing a trust fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.329" offset="1226351">For that matter if the beneficiarie's argument prevail many children would actually lose benefits since eligibility for some benefits is lost if resources creep up above a minimum level.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.513" offset="1279118">The opinion of the Court is unanimous.</text>
