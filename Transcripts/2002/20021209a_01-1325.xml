            <text syncTime="2552.748" offset="10357749">They say at page 149 of the joint appendix from the original IOLTA order, in adopting these amendments to the Code of Professional Responsibility, we make clear that those funds available for the IOLTA program are only those that cannot under any circumstances earn net interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="3174.925" offset="12846487">Four, even if you think some compensation might be due, they've never gone to the State... not a single client... and tried to prove up the amount of compensation, which is very much in dispute if you look at their earnings credit analysis, unlike Eastern Enterprises where we knew the exact amount, it's very much in dispute whether some or all of those costs would have been borne down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.866" offset="12926213">And finally, even if you reject all our other positions, you then reach an argument that we don't need to make because we believe in our other arguments, and that is, why not treat this as a valid revenue measure?</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.095" offset="12971143">Unlike the bad revenue measures of Eastern Enterprises, where the State, or the Government was imposing a retroactive onerous burden on a few identifiable, known people, here it's prospective, reasonably broadly based, and raises... and modest in the exaction.</text>
