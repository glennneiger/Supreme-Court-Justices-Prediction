            <text syncTime="65.759" offset="412648">In 1987, the Secretary of the Interior, at the request of the Navajo Nation and Peabody Coal Company, approved a package of lease amendments to two outstanding leases between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.352" offset="463012">With respect to the lease principally at issue here, Lease number 8580, the amendments increased the royalty to be paid by Peabody from 37-and-a-half cents per ton to 12-and-a-half percent of the value of the coal, a more than six-fold increase in the amount of the royalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.852" offset="533020">That new royalty level was the same as the standard royalty on Federal coal leases, and it was well in excess of the then regulatory minimum that the Secretary had prescribed for what a tribe and a coal company could agree to, which was then only 10 cents per ton.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.820" offset="600834">The package of lease amendments also contained numerous other provisions that were of benefit to the tribe, including amendments to the other lease, that more... that approximately doubled the amount of the royalty and a substantial increase in payments for water use at the mines.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.628" offset="664155">The Secretary's approval of the lease package in 1987 fully complied with the Mineral Leasing Act and the regulations that the Secretary has prescribed to govern her approval of lease agreements under that act.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.226" offset="730506">Because there was no violation of any act of Congress or regulation of an executive department, much less one that could fairly be interpreted as mandating the payment of damages by the Government, there is no cause of action in this case under the Tucker Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1306.494" offset="5375600">But it seems to me that they have a stronger argument and it is closer to the termite argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.695" offset="5396393">And the stronger argument is whatever your obligations as a trustee may be under the approval responsibility, you at least have an obligation not to skew the bargaining process in a way that hurts us when you know that is what it will do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.098" offset="5474029">And as I understand the argument about the ex parte communication, it's not that the ex parte communication was per se unlawful.</text>

            <text syncTime="1343.441" offset="5523348">The argument is that the ex parte communication resulted in action by the Secretary that, in effect, induced the tribe to take a different negotiating posture from the one it would have taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.076" offset="5589908">And therefore, their argument is like the termite argument: You're not supposed to introduce bad termites into the forest, and you're not supposed to take action as a minimum that hurts us as negotiators.</text>

            <text syncTime="3323.124" offset="13442107">If that's what the trustee wanted to say, the trustee should have said, I've met with Peabody.</text>

            <text syncTime="3341.179" offset="13514310">If we had been given that information, we would have taken a much different approach.</text>

            <text syncTime="3345.620" offset="13532073">Now, I think Justice O'Connor made the point that if all we have... if... if the trust duty only applies to specific statutory and regulatory violations, then it's meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.366" offset="13587035">The trust duty has to be something greater than that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3398.421" offset="13743247">It gives people... Indian tribes and Indian people the same access to the court, and it uses a different word.</text>

            <text syncTime="3410.225" offset="13790476">And we know from Illinois versus City of Milwaukee and other cases that laws means Federal common law and the... and if there's anything that's grounded in the Federal common law tradition, it's the trust duty owed to Indian tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.343" offset="13847005">And that's what we sue under, the Indian Tucker Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3446.180" offset="13934359">And as this Court indicated in the Shoshone case, the Navajo tribe was entitled to a fidelity at least as constant.</text>

            <text syncTime="3465.499" offset="14011577">Thank you, Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.099" offset="14022026">First, with several factual points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.751" offset="14028609">The tribe did know the substance of... of what had happened with respect to Secretary Hodel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.810" offset="14056821">As I pointed out earlier, Mr. Nelson's deposition, which is excerpted in the joint appendix, makes clear that the tribe had learned, he said, from Washington that... that it was requested there that they go back to negotiations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.640" offset="14112200">And also I would call the Court's attention to page 2370 of the appendix, which are notes of the negotiating session... first negotiating session that occurred after that on August 30th, 1985.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.816" offset="14160893">It's a note in which Chairman Zah of the Nation acknowledges that Secretary Hodel apparently wanted them to go back and try to reach an agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.195" offset="14194329">So it's clear that the parties entered into these negotiations with a full understanding of... of what the Secretary's preferred course was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.369" offset="14227035">Secondly, I think it's... it's completely not true that Secretary Hodel directed a subordinate to lie to the Navajo Nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.914" offset="14261203">The... on page 117 of the joint appendix, there's a copy of the directive that... or the... the memorandum that Secretary Hodel sent to the Assistant Secretary about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.857" offset="14320971">And he makes four very significant points entirely reasonable under the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.770" offset="14340720">He... he referred to the fact that affirming the decision outright unilaterally might lead to prolonged litigation, during which the... Peabody might well put the... the royalties into escrow and the tribe wouldn't get them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.055" offset="14397771">It would impair the future ongoing contractual relationship between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.885" offset="14417102">Peabody has a huge presence on the reservation, and it was obviously beneficial for the parties to resolve this peaceably and not just this isolated royalty increase under this one lease, but a whole host of issues that were... that were facing the two parties: taxation, payment for water, other... other leases in which there was a significant increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.607" offset="14500067">And those other leases, by the way, did not have an adjustment clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.155" offset="14514173">So the tribe here got the benefit not only of an increase on this lease, but an increase on a lease that did not have an adjustment clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.585" offset="14543952">And Secretary Hodel then said it would be preferable to allow the parties to negotiate, and then importantly at the end, he said, I haven't reached a final decision on the merits of the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.495" offset="14583554">I just think it would be better if the parties went back and negotiated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.641" offset="14592122">And since, as Justice Scalia pointed out, this was a lease provision that was... protected both parties, what is reasonable for both parties, it was certainly an appropriate resolution of that for the Secretary to say... in the normal situation where you have a... a disagreement, or differing views under a lease, to send the parties back and seek to have them negotiate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.818" offset="14676863">Also, I would point out on page 125 of the joint appendix, there's a letter from Mr. Vollmann in which he points out that the Secretary is aware of each party's concerns about the settlement, again making it clear that... that the Department in Washington was aware of the state of affairs out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.880" offset="14757111">So the only... the only... aside from all of that, the claims about the negotiations that preceded the 1987 lease amendments are essentially procedural or tort claims, or claims about improper regulation of... of a negotiating process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.309" offset="14822836">They aren't the sort of money-mandating statutory or... first of all, there's no claim... no... no identification of a statutory or regulatory provision that... that specifically regulates this and was violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3678.424" offset="14863273">But in any event, just like the Due Process Clause that this Court held in Testan is not money-mandating, the same is true here as well.</text>
