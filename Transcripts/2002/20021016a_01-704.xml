            <text syncTime="154.272" offset="764598">So what we have here is an express prohibition against ATF exercising the power that Congress conferred on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.083" offset="799916">Under the Administrative Procedure Act, the only power a court has in judicial review of agency action is to review what the agency did, and it may only set aside the agency action if the agency action is arbitrary or capricious or contrary to law.</text>

            <text syncTime="193.060" offset="919766">Would that be a violation of Article III?</text>

            <text syncTime="194.977" offset="927393">Well, I think there would be a question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.199" offset="940350">As I recall, there was, and I think it still may be true that courts may grant applications for naturalization, but the court I believe concluded that there was at least an implicit adversarial process in the sense that the Government could appear on the other side of the case and oppose it, but I think you raise a very good point in terms of what would be the traditional way that something like this would be accomplished, and that is that it would be natural, and this is what Congress did in 925(c), to confer this authority on the executive branch, and it did it in very broad and general terms and then provided that a person whose application is denied may file a petition in district court for judicial review of such denial.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.566" offset="1141806">In other words, under 925(c) it is the denial by the ATF, not the application itself, that is the subject of judicial review.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="257.886" offset="1179109">Is the refusal of the ATF to act on an application pursuant to this provision in the appropriation a de facto denial that's reviewable?</text>

            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="273.269" offset="1240654">We think it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.457" offset="1245356">As we explained in our brief, we believe the word denial in that context means a denial on the merits, and this is what a number of the courts of appeals that have looked at the question have held, and what Congress said in the Appropriations Act is that ATF is barred from even acting upon the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.231" offset="1316409">In other words, it can't either grant or deny the application for relief, and therefore the predicate for judicial review under 925(c) is missing.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.280" offset="1352667">We're not saying that there is no judicial review at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.893" offset="1367086">The general provisions of the APA remain available and, under 5 U.S.C. 703, the avenue for judicial review, or the form of the judicial review is either the special statutory review procedure, in this case 925(c), or in the absence of that or its inadequacy, then another appropriate form, in other words, the general provisions of the APA.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.901" offset="1459142">But once again, the power of a court under the general provisions of the APA is simply to review the agency's action and to set it aside if contrary to law, and here the action was not contrary to law, it was compelled by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.150" offset="1512118">The most direct avenue that respondent could have challenged the agency's approach in this case, its failure to act, was under section 706(1), which provides for a court in reviewing agency action to set aside agency action that is... or excuse me, to compel agency action that is unreasonably delayed or unlawfully withheld; and, again, there was nothing unlawful about ATF's withholding of a decision on respondent's application for relief, because Congress compelled that withholding.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="378.209" offset="1660389">Mr. Kneedler, there was an alternate argument that a foreign conviction shouldn't count for this purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.475" offset="1701454">Has the United States ever taken a position on that?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="392.457" stopTime="512.482">

            <text syncTime="393.191" offset="1720262">Yes, we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.734" offset="1722456">It is the position of the United States that foreign convictions are covered by the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.508" offset="1741578">Now, that is not before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.196" offset="1748370">The... in fact, below respondent conceded that a foreign conviction is a proper predicate under 922(g)(1), and the Eleventh Circuit expressly declined to reach that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.922" offset="1807197">It wasn't presented in the petition and it's not before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.243" offset="1824543">Indeed, the question of whether a foreign conviction would be a proper predicate is something that would be raised under 922(g) in a prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.384" offset="1865085">As we point out in our brief, there is a circuit conflict on that question, but that conflict has arisen in cases, criminal prosecutions brought under 922(g), and that would be the proper place to begin to make that claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.660" offset="1914195">Neither the general provisions of the APA nor 925(c) provides someone who is wondering whether he may or may not be covered by a provision of the Federal criminal laws to bring a declaratory judgment against the United States to determine whether conduct he hopes to engage in would be covered by a particular criminal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.544" offset="2001757">So even though it... it isn't before this Court, but we also believe that this would not be the proper avenue in which to raise such a claim in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.805" offset="2038747">Respondent has argued that what is going on here is an implied repeal of the judicial review provisions or the jurisdiction of the Federal courts to act in a case such as this and, as I've said, there's nothing implied.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.286" offset="2108650">What Congress did was expressly bar ATF, and it otherwise left the court's authority unaffected.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.726" offset="2134459">925(c) remains in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.351" offset="2144908">It's just that, by virtue of Congress's prohibiting ATF from acting on applications for relief, there is no denial which could be the predicate for review under that, under that special statutory review procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="515.092" offset="2207916">I mean, in Robertson, the amendment of a prior statute was affected not by the simple means of withholding appropriations.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.964" offset="2247413">I mean, it set forth different language that was going to govern the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.418" offset="2273222">Here, the only thing that has happened is they're not given any appropriations, and you think it is not a matter... you think it's entirely clear that when the Secretary receives an application and says, I cannot act on this application because the appropriations rider forbids me, do you think it's entirely clear that that does not amount to a denial of the application?</text>

            <text syncTime="557.730" offset="2378443">Well, it may be the better one, but is it clear?</text>
            <text syncTime="559.496" offset="2385548">I mean, the law is that unless you make it quite clear in the appropriations statute that you are intending to amend the prior law, the prior law is not amended.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="572.691" offset="2438316">Again, the... our position is not that Congress amended the judicial review provision of 925(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="579.402" offset="2465170">What it did was prohibit ATF from acting.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.063" offset="2475828">925(c)'s judicial review procedure is still in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.370" offset="2492964">The question is whether the... whether Congress's directive to ATF not to even act upon applications for relief constitutes a denial and, as I say, ATF is barred from either granting or denying relief, and I would refer the Court also to the general definition of agency action under the APA, which we cite in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.272" offset="2584602">This is 5 U.S.C. 551 (13).</text>
            <text syncTime="612.441" offset="2597349">It defines agency action as an agency rule, order, license, sanction, relief, or the equivalent, or the denial thereof, or a failure to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.887" offset="2639041">So under the APA, which is the general statute governing traditional review of agency action, Congress itself has defined a denial of relief as something different from a failure to act, and I think there's every reason to look at 925(c)'s reference to a denial as being consistent, rather than inconsistent with the general definitions that Congress has applied under the APA.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.105" offset="2747919">I would also add, though, that it doesn't matter, that even if the ATF's decision were viewed as a denial within the meaning of 925(c), the general APA standards for reviewing that denial still apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.914" offset="2807165">As we point out in our brief, this Court's decision in Zurko and the prior decision in the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers both make clear that, even where you do have a special statutory review procedure that establishes the form for judicial review, the nature and character, as the Court said in Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, of that judicial review is defined by the general provisions of the APA, section 706; and again, under those provisions the court can only set aside agency action that is contrary to law; and again, here, the ATF's action was compelled by law, not contrary to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.663" offset="2966198">So whichever avenue this suit was thought to have been brought under, there was no basis for the district court to grant relief at all, and we also think that that is entirely consistent with the Congress's purposes in enacting the appropriations bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.931" offset="3039237">The legislative history which respondent has produced as an appendix to his brief explains that Congress had become concerned about the inherently subjective nature of the inquiry that ATF was undertaking, and the severe consequences that could result if ATF had made a mistake, and also that Congress believed that the money that was being spent for that purpose, $4 million a year for 40 positions at ATF, would be better served--</text>

            <text syncTime="1751.481" offset="7153418">The delegation here provides that... and this was in 19... when the BATF was created, the Secretary provided that the Director shall act under the general supervision of the Secretary and under... excuse me, and under the supervision of the Assistant Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.357" offset="7220918">The parallel that's drawn by the Solicitor General is to United States v. Nixon and to the Accardi case, and those were exclusive delegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.054" offset="7255713">In United States v. Nixon this Court said... and this is at page 695 of the opinion... that the special prosecutor had plenary authority, and the regulation provided that the Attorney General shall not interfere with the special prosecutor's decision, and in Accardi, and this is at page 266, the Court said that... the scheme in Accardi was that the Attorney General would act only after the Bureau of Immigration Affairs, and that clearly contemplated that the AG would stay out of the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.917" offset="7379220">In any event, not only is this not an exclusive delegation, but our fundamental point is that it's an illegal delegation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2257.761" offset="9178535">Under that provision, ATF said that any person who is a firearms licensee... let me briefly draw the distinction here, and that is, there are people who are allowed to have firearms under State law, but there are federally licensed dealers, importers, collectors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.880" offset="9235064">In the latter class, any person who submits an application to ATF is allowed to continue operating for 30 days, until 30 days after the denial.</text>

            <text syncTime="3068.685" offset="12422316">That seems to me the most powerful argument, that there's no point sending it back to the Secretary, really, even though that's the correct procedural route, if the Secretary under the law has no choice, and what he's saying is, the Secretary under the law has no choice, and the reason is because literally this appropriations measure doesn't cover the Secretary's action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.617" offset="12530045">And given the absence of that, the Secretary's under a statute that tells him, act, and moreover, he adds, this is a very bad way to repeal a statute, that really under normal legislative principles if they want to repeal it, repeal it; and therefore it isn't wrong for us to consider this literally in this circumstance.</text>

            <text syncTime="3142.091" offset="12715932">We point out on page 4 and 5 of our reply brief general principles of appropriations law that are really a particular application of the general principle that the specific governs the general, and under appropriations law, when Congress appropriates a pot of money for a particular task, that's all that can be spent for that task.</text>

            <text syncTime="3169.817" offset="12826796">We think that principle should apply a fortiori, or at least it's a reasonable interpretation for the Secretary to make, that when Congress has prohibited the expenditure of any funds by the agency to whom the Secretary has delegated that authority, that Congress did not expect money to be drawn from some other pot.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.776" offset="12910597">That is a general principle of appropriations law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3295.130" offset="13328033">The Secretary, in deciding whether to take this power back to himself, could at the very least take into account what Congress has said about not wanting these applications to be acted upon by ATF, and also the reasons the Congress gave, which is that this is a very subjective undertaking, with high risk, and Congress decided, we don't want this function being performed because of the potential consequences.</text>

            <text syncTime="3374.737" offset="13646518">It establishes several preconditions, whether the person would be dangerous to the public safety, and whether granting it would not be contrary to the public interest, and even then the Secretary is not required to grant relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.101" offset="13699913">This is a very broad discretionary power, and I think it ties into what Justice Ginsburg was asking earlier, wouldn't this be an extraordinary power to give to the Federal district courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.155" offset="13740141">Indeed it would, because the question is not just whether the person might be dangerous, but whether granting relief would be contrary to the public interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="3457.914" offset="13979214">He was just testifying as to what he had looked up in the records, but an investigation involves far more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.940" offset="14007322">In fact, the AUSA in this case cross-examined Mr. Bean and a couple of other witnesses, but that's far short of the investigation that Congress expected ATF to undertake when it was performing these functions, and that it did undertake, which involved an investigation of the crime, neighbors, not just the people whom respondent has put forward, but ATF would go out and develop its own independent leads.</text>
