            <text syncTime="3577.753" offset="14460058">Justice Souter, the tie-breaker is the intent to intimidate which is in our statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.433" offset="14478867">If there's no intent to intimidate, there's no violation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.099" offset="14489525">Opposing counsel's problem is how does the Klan go out in public and burn a cross and have it viewed not as its common, ordinary meaning backed up by 100 years of history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.276" offset="14538217">Well, one thing they could do is not talk about shooting blacks with a.30/.30.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.395" offset="14558697">That might suggest there's no intent to intimidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.078" offset="14569355">Opposing counsel suggests that there should be a broader law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.332" offset="14586387">Well, Congress could pass a broader law, one that didn't focus on threats against the President, one that focused on threats against any Federal employee, but this Court has said a broader law is not needed because threats against the President are especially problematic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.140" offset="14649603">So is cross-burning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.453" offset="14658903">It is not just hate speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.682" offset="14667784">It doesn't just say I don't like you because you are black.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.942" offset="14680845">In the hands of the Klan, the message is the law cannot help you if you're black or Catholic or Jewish or foreign-born, or we just don't like you, and if you try to live your life as a free American, we are going to kill you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.886" offset="14740614">That is the message of cross-burning backed up by 100 years of history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3652.650" offset="14759735">That's why it is especially virulent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.233" offset="14769975">And that's why under R.A.V., this Court can allow us to proscribe it without having to pass any other law, or pretend it is the same as something quite different than what it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.115" offset="14821593">We have not interfered with freedom of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.695" offset="14839879">We have not tried to suppress any idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="3675.750" offset="14852104">All we have tried to do is to protect freedom from fear for all of our citizens by guarding against this especially virulent form of intimidation.</text>
