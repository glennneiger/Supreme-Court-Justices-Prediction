            <text syncTime="64.888" offset="405313">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="68.716" offset="420673">Petitioner comes before the Court asking one thing and one thing only, that the State of California be bound by its decrees and its laws that have guided it throughout the history of California, that the State and the Federal Government be bound by the laws of the land that have been in place essentially since the State's foundation.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.202" offset="498623">Since early on in this country's history, Chief Justice Marshall looked at a matter similar and said it would be repugnant to the genius of our laws to allow the prosecution to continue after the statute of limitations had expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.486" offset="571765">Such has been the law that only a few times in the history of this Nation has any State had the trepidation to attempt to revive an expired cause of action in a criminal matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.198" offset="618577">In each such instance, the States have been... the State has not been permitted to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.158" offset="646476">In each such instance, such as in State v. Sneed, Moore v. State, and other such cases--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <text syncTime="137.665" offset="696422">And... however, as I said, in Adams v. Wood, it involved a Federal matter and it involved a matter that we might consider equally repugnant.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.310" offset="739054">It had to do with the prosecution of an individual who was involved in the slave trade and laws that prohibited that.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.350" offset="787223">However, the attempt to punish that occurred after the statute had run, and Mr. Chief Justice Marshall indicated in that particular case that even if the case had been treason, it could not be prosecuted, for under the Federal law, treason was only prosecutable for a 3-year period.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="180.753" offset="868830">Did he base his decision, the one that you're referring to, on the Ex Post Facto Clause?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="roberto_najera" startTime="187.315" stopTime="248.453">
            <label>Mr. Roberto Najera</label>
            <text syncTime="187.315" offset="895057">No, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.051" offset="897983">He based it on the law that the statute of limitations in that case, the Federal law had in fact called for an expiration of the cause of action, and the Court there decided that, no, it could not be prosecuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.729" offset="952735">But no, he did not decide it on the ex post facto basis, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.633" offset="964334">As the Court knows, we raise two issues here, the Ex Post Facto Clause and the Due Process Clause, and I would like to point out that the two clauses, while they both deal with arbitrariness and unfairness, are not coextensive and that similarly, in addressing the matter, neither is petitioner's claim as to each, for under the Ex Post Facto Clause, we are not looking as to whether rights have vested.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.386" offset="1075406">Such is not a concern of the Court for ex post facto concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.367" offset="1091289">However, in this particular case, Mr. Stogner has been vested with a right.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.998" offset="1113754">The State of California has given him a substantive right, a defense that is neither waivable nor forfeitable.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="248.453" stopTime="266.682">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="248.453" offset="1139667">We've said in Graham against Connor that if a provision of the Constitution speaks directly to a subject matter, such as I think the Ex Post Facto Clause does to your case here, then we don't go to substantive due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.276" offset="1202884">We analyze it just under that provision.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="roberto_najera" startTime="266.682" stopTime="321.315">
            <label>Mr. Roberto Najera</label>
            <text syncTime="266.682" offset="1212497">That is correct, Your Honor. However, as I indicated, the two claims are... are not necessarily coextensive, and I would like to point the Court out to the case of Sacramento v. Lewis.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.423" offset="1251472">There, the Court may recall, involved a high-speed chase.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.646" offset="1268399">The police were after individuals on a motorcycle.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.512" offset="1279893">The motorcycle crashed.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.572" offset="1288147">There was in that case no Fourth Amendment claim because no seizure had occurred of the person prior to the crash taking place.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.844" offset="1329212">The Court, nevertheless, was able to analyze that case under the substantive due process principles because it fell outside of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.285" offset="1362962">Here we clearly believe that the case falls well within the... the Ex Post Facto Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.968" offset="1385636">However, should the Court decide otherwise, it strikes me that it should not render this Court impotent to examine the matter as a substantive due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.489" offset="1427746">It seems--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="321.315" stopTime="352.846">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="321.315" offset="1431089">That... that would render the rule quite pointless.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.755" offset="1440807">I mean, the rule is if it is analyzable under... under a very specific provision of the Constitution and is not valid under that one, you then don't move on to analyze it under another one.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.782" offset="1512905">And... but you're saying unless you win under the narrow one, it's not over.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.761" offset="1540908">If you lose under the narrow one, you then can go on to the Due Process Clause.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="roberto_najera" startTime="352.846" stopTime="353.642">
            <label>Mr. Roberto Najera</label>
            <text syncTime="352.846" offset="1557209">--Well--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="353.642" stopTime="357.487">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="353.642" offset="1560343">That doesn't make it much of a... much of a safeguard, it seems to me.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="roberto_najera" startTime="357.487" stopTime="450.921">
            <label>Mr. Roberto Najera</label>
            <text syncTime="357.487" offset="1575808">--Well, Justice Scalia, as I've indicated, the causes are not... are not absolutely coextensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.231" offset="1618753">We have in this case a vested right.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.026" offset="1629934">The State of California has guaranteed to the petitioner the right that he be free from prosecution, the right that he be free from conviction, and the right that he be free from punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.495" offset="1675805">This is vested to him under State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.859" offset="1693254">As such, that can be analyzed, whether or not the Court deems it sufficient, under the Ex Post Facto Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.061" offset="1722094">As the Court said in Weaver, we are not concerned under the Ex Post Facto Clause with vested rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.339" offset="1747171">That's not necessary for analysis under the Ex Post Facto Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.648" offset="1764412">It is an additional factor that the Court certainly should and, we urge, must consider under the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.387" offset="1791370">If I may continue, analyzing the matter first under the Ex Post Facto Clause, I think the first question perhaps that should be addressed is whether or not this is a rule of evidence and whether or not it falls within Calder four.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.826" offset="1857094">Clearly this is a rule of evidence as the State of California has defined it.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.085" offset="1878201">It is a rule of evidence because it is required of any finder of fact, whether it be a judge sitting pretrial examining the matter as a demurrer or in analyzing the matter as sufficiency of evidence under Penal Code 995.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="450.921" stopTime="457.748">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="450.921" offset="1949463">But it doesn't... it doesn't go to the kind of evidence necessary to prove the substantive offense certainly.</text>

          <turn speaker="roberto_najera" startTime="457.748" stopTime="489.638">
            <label>Mr. Roberto Najera</label>

            <text syncTime="458.737" offset="1980810">I... I would beg to differ, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.120" offset="1990319">And the reason is, is California has injected the statute of limitations into every offense in which it applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.247" offset="2026786">In such cases it becomes a material ingredient of the offense, and in such cases the prosecution is barred if that material ingredient is not proven by the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.276" offset="2070881">And if the matter should proceed to trial, a jury must acquit if the prosecution is not able to overcome its burden in that particular case.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="489.638" stopTime="499.145">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="489.638" offset="2104317">But that... that simply says there is another substantive element there.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.731" offset="2120722">It doesn't say what rule of evidence you follow to decide how that was made out.</text>

            <label>Mr. Roberto Najera</label>
            <text syncTime="499.145" offset="2142352">It does, Your Honor, in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.169" offset="2158443">If the evidence comes before a jury, for example, and the evidence shows that the prosecution is barred, that no public offense is stated, the jury must acquit.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.222" offset="2198672">It is a rule that guides the jurors, as much as it would guide a court, in deciding what must be done with the particular facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.703" offset="2228660">If the facts before the court show that the case is barred, then the prosecution cannot continue.</text>

            <text syncTime="528.190" offset="2258544">It... it would seem to me to be one of the most clear rules of evidence and applicable throughout, not just to California and not just to the Federal Government--</text>

Your Honor, whether comfortable or not, I believe it fits, and I believe that it fits within each of the four categories, not only because of the nature of the Ex Post Facto Clause, but because of the multifaceted nature of the statute of limitations at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.513" offset="4779883">For example, if we look at Calder category three, which deals with punishments and the laws that are annexed to the punishment, in the case of Lynce, which I believe was authored by Your Honor, in that case what was at stake was not what the State had defined as the punishment per se, the number of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.412" offset="4859504">What was at stake there was that the State itself had granted credits, overcrowding credits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.206" offset="4882596">They did not even intend to... to give a benefit to the defendant there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.102" offset="4898270">And yet it fell within Calder three because the punishment had been reduced by laws that were annexed to the crime, the laws dealing with the overcrowding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.396" offset="4935364">And in that way, one can say if the Court rejects the principle that this is a material ingredient of the offense itself, as California has defined it, certainly as a matter of punishment, it is a law that's annexed to that punishment and says, after a certain period of time, no punishment shall be had.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.119" offset="5010283">And that's quite clear under California law because it is not a waivable right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.154" offset="5030449">In other words, a person can go ahead and proceed to trial or go ahead and plead guilty and be languishing in prison and suffering the punishment and years later discover that he has a statute of limitation right and assert it then and punishment shall be had no more.</text>

            <text syncTime="2880.284" offset="11666910">In Collins, the Court resolved that debate and said that the Ex Post Facto Clause is limited to the four Calder categories.</text>

            <text syncTime="3072.426" offset="12435537">And that is the limit of what those two categories involve, and neither of those are implicated in this case because the punishment is exactly the same in form and amount as that which was prescribed at the time of the offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="3307.476" offset="13375736">Now, explaining further why the fourth category needs to be read in this way, there are several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.302" offset="13399037">The first is that's the way the Court has applied the fourth category.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.040" offset="13413979">In situations where there's been a change in what evidence is sufficient to prove the first... to prove the defendant committed a crime, it found a violation, as in Carmell and as in Cummings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.628" offset="13464343">But where the change was... there was a change in what was sufficient to establish some other precondition that doesn't go back to whether the defendant acted criminally at the beginning, the Court hasn't found a violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.255" offset="13518783">And... and the example is Gut v. Minnesota where there was a change in the venue rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.629" offset="13536337">What was changed there... change was... was sufficient to prove venue, which was a precondition to guilt, but it didn't change what was sufficient to prove that the defendant acted in a criminal manner when he acted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.087" offset="13590149">And the Court said that there was no fourth category violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.712" offset="13604673">Also, the statutes of limitations for over 100 years... all the courts have concluded that if you retroactively amend an expired limit... I'm sorry... an unexpired limitations period, there's no Ex Post Facto Clause violation, and in terms of the Calder category four, there's absolutely no difference between those statutes and this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.030" offset="13705924">In both cases, it changes what's sufficient to show that there is a timely prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.636" offset="13728389">In neither case does it change what's sufficient to show that the defendant committed... when he acted, he committed a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.541" offset="13759945">And that is what category four is about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.520" offset="13771857">Finally, in Carmell, this Court noted that category four is a mirror image of category one, and it said they both work together to prevent subversions of the presumption of innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.858" offset="13833297">And that description of category four supports the conclusion of the linkage between four and one that the... what you're talking about are rules that change what evidence is sufficient to show that the defendant's conduct was a crime when he acted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.230" offset="13898707">And that's not... and the statute of limitations here doesn't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.518" offset="13915844">It changes what's sufficient to show that there's been a timely prosecution. It doesn't change in any way what's sufficient to show that the defendant committed a crime when he acted.</text>

            <text syncTime="3525.661" offset="14248435">Turning to the Collins question, the real import in Collins was not to get caught up in distinctions or labels such as substantive versus procedure, and it would seem that if we began to draw such distinctions here, we run ultimately into the same problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.479" offset="14311756">And it would seem to me that if Collins stands for the proposition that affirmative defenses, defenses which the defendant has the burden of establishing, are protected, why are not defenses that the district attorney must disprove such as the statute of limitations?</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.530" offset="14383958">For this has always been, in California, the burden upon the prosecution to show that the statute has in fact not run.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.151" offset="14414469">Also, it seems that the State wishes to shift the burden and foist it upon the petitioner and says, well, we can address this in procedural due process, while in fact that, as I said, foists the burden onto the petitioner when the burden in fact lies with the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.673" offset="14484477">And in the Marion case, Supreme Court case, the Court reaffirmed that an irrebuttable presumption of harm occurs by such delay, and that's by way of the legislative act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.832" offset="14533169">Finally, I'd like to note that not only would finality be upset in these particular cases, but really what we're talking about is respect for the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.595" offset="14572144">Every day in this country citizens make bargains with... with the State, and the State makes bargains with its citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.514" offset="14599834">It did so by creating a statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.476" offset="14611746">And every day, particularly in the criminal field, most, the vast majority of the accused enter into bargains.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.556" offset="14644033">They plea bargain. They give away their rights and accept a bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.382" offset="14663364">And we hold them to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.117" offset="14670260">We hold them accountable for what they bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.172" offset="14682485">Are we here... if we accept the State's position, are we here to hold the State to a lesser standard than we hold to what many consider the meanest and lowest amongst us?</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.284" offset="14726998">I would think not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3646.414" offset="14731491">I think we would expect the State and the Federal Government to stand for something more, to be the leader and not the follower, to have a standard higher or at least equal to that of which we expect of each of our accused, each person who pleads in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.087" offset="14794185">I would ask, as I said in the beginning, that this Court hold the State to the bargain that it chose to make, to the terms that it chose to define by creating the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.173" offset="14834518">And if there are no further questions, I will submit the matter.</text>
