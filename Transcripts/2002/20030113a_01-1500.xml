            <text syncTime="59.695" offset="380217">Paragraph 6 of section 2255 provides that, quote, a 1-year period of limitation shall apply to a motion under this section.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.285" offset="414594">The limitation period shall run from the latest of... and it identifies four events, the first of which is, quote, the date on which the judgment of conviction became final.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.232" offset="450330">Congress did not define or otherwise explicate when the judgment becomes final in that provision, and the question presented by this case is that, given that final can mean many different things in different contexts, when does it... judgment become final here?</text>
            <text syncTime="90.488" offset="503306">Petitioner agrees with the clear majority of circuits and the United States that the judgment becomes final upon the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of time for seeking such review.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.126" offset="549909">As applied to this case, petitioner's time to seek 2255 relief began to run when his time to seek certiorari in this Court expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.949" offset="585226">Congress most likely intended that interpretation for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.712" offset="644263">First, it is the one that this Court has consistently used in the most analogous context, and that is the dividing line between direct and collateral review; and, second--</text>

            <text syncTime="146.875" offset="728900">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and that is, in effect, our point.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.836" offset="740707">Those... most of those contexts, however, do deal with the dividing line between direct and collateral review.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.952" offset="765262">The amicus quite rightly points out that there are other meanings of final.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.226" offset="782294">We do believe, however, that they don't... they aren't as close as this one, and they aren't the one that Congress most naturally looked to, and since Congress didn't tell this Court what it meant, you would look to the dividing line between direct and collateral review, because that's the point of this provision in section 2255.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.869" offset="844883">I mentioned there was a second reason that I'll come to, and that is that the... the minority rule doesn't work textually and would produce anomalous results.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.327" offset="874663">The... as I mentioned, the Court has picked up the notion of final... the judgment of conviction becoming final, and that language appears almost verbatim in Linkletter, in contexts like Teague, Barefoot, and Bell.</text>

            <text syncTime="200.652" offset="944044">Mr. Chief Justice, but I think the point still would favor us.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.156" offset="958046">You're absolutely right, because although the Court has changed the line for retroactivity and changed the test, it has never changed the definition of what is final, and so for 40 years plus the Court has consistently included the time to seek certiorari, and that's a perfectly sensible result, as it would be applied in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.006" offset="1037458">The... the minority rule, by contrast, would produce anomalous results.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.356" offset="1058878">It would mean, for example, that in the couple of months after the mandate issues in the court of appeals, a judgment of conviction would be both final and non-final at the same time, because you wouldn't... although the statute refers to the judgment of conviction becoming final, you wouldn't actually know at that point.</text>

            <text syncTime="245.676" offset="1124080">I thought that their... amicus wrote, you know, a pretty good argument on that side, and I thought one of his better points, which is that if we're looking at the... the 1-year limitation from a person in State proceedings, what it says is, it runs from the latest of the date on which judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review, or the expiration of time for seeking such review; and then when you look to the parallel for somebody in Federal proceedings, it says it becomes final from the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.335" offset="1258767">In other words, they use the first half of the sentence, doesn't use the sentence... the second; and in... in the State proceeding it has two, and here it has one, and he says you have to give some meaning to that difference.</text>

            <text syncTime="292.385" offset="1310908">Justice Breyer, that is exactly what has caused the Fourth and Seventh Circuits to scratch their head.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.987" offset="1329402">It's a conceivable inference.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.689" offset="1336194">We don't dispute that.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.533" offset="1339538">Of course, the majority of courts have applied another canon of construction here, and that is that when Congress uses the same phrase in a statute, it's interpreted generally, absent some strong contrary indication, to have the same meaning.</text>

            <text syncTime="407.828" offset="1772753">--Justice Ginsburg, it is correct that we think it would mean the same thing even if it weren't there, but it's not surplusage.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.684" offset="1796158">It does have a role, and so I have several reasons to articulate to the Court why there's no negative pregnant... our view is, and this Court has said, not every silence is pregnant.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.464" offset="1831267">What we have in 2255 is silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.823" offset="1840671">My point, Justice Ginsburg, is that the inference that the minority of courts draw, that Congress was doing something special in 2244, and therefore impliedly didn't intend to do the same thing in 2255, is not correct, and I have several points.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.682" offset="1892185">The first one goes to yours, Justice Ginsburg, and that is, it's reasonable for this Court to ask, okay, why did it put it in 2244 and it didn't put it in 2255?</text>
            <text syncTime="446.759" offset="1928442">It would have been easier, obviously, if it had put it in 2255.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.228" offset="1942340">The reason we think they put it in 2244 is not to specify which among the Federal interpretations of "judgment becomes final" applies, but to say that it's the Federal one, not the State one.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.687" offset="1992181">That's the real difference of force between 2244 instead of 2255.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.233" offset="2010362">2244 cases come out of the State courts, and State courts define finality differently, and so what Congress did there in 44 was make quite clear that they were applying the Federal rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.298" offset="2054562">That was very important in particular, because State proceedings have the added complication of not just State direct review, but State post-conviction review, and so Federal habeas courts could be terribly confused on when the judgment and--</text>

            <text syncTime="517.399" offset="2210983">Well, but you can also say that they had to give a special meaning of finality so that we could respect the processes of the States and make it clear that the... all of the State procedures had to be exhausted, as the Chief Justice indicated, because of the intrusive nature of... of habeas jurisprudence, of habeas orders from the Federal courts, and so you can read this as... as being an exception to this general Federal rule when, in fact... that brings me to another point... you can address both.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.422" offset="2339087">I... I had... I had thought, as the amicus brief does indicate, that finality usually does mean from the date of the issuance of the mandate, and then you go back and you toll if there's... if there's discretionary review.</text>

            <text syncTime="566.338" offset="2406797">--Justice Kennedy, this is the second point on the question of do... does this Court have some reason to believe that the presence in 24... excuse me, 44 but not 55 creates a negative inference, the sort of Russello presumption, and I agree with you that it would rest on a view that this interpretation in 44(d)(1) is unusual, and our point is that it's not unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.102" offset="2489866">You are correct that the... the... as they said in Melconian, for example, that the term of art, final judgment, does generally mean the judgment of the district court, but everyone agrees that that's not the interpretation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.446" offset="2539185">In fact, it's very clear that the... the phrase here, if I could again take you back to... take you back to it in 2255, is judgment of conviction becomes final.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.651" offset="2571995">That phrase, judgment of conviction, picks up Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.671" offset="2592057">Judgment of conviction includes the conviction, the judgment of conviction and the sentence, and it is by necessity already final and appealable.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.880" offset="2620896">If this Court were to say that the baseline rule is final judgment in the sense of a district court, that would mean in the 2255 context that, although your... your direct appeal could be sitting here in the Seventh Circuit for 2 years, after the first year, you need to be back in the district court on 2255, because the judgment of conviction would have become final when it was entered by the district court, and no one thinks that's sensible.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.891" offset="2720998">In fact, the... the notes to rule 5 of the... of the 2255 rules make quite clear you're not supposed to be in on your 2255 until the direct review process is over, so that... my point was that the... what you're describing as the normal background rule of when a judgment of conviction becomes final actually describes the term "final judgment", which couldn't apply here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1418.808" offset="5816612">There are four points that are dispositive of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.162" offset="5830091">First, the most natural and logical inference is that the textual language in section 2255 cannot mean exactly the same thing as the very different textual language enacted at the same time in the same statute in section 2244.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.502" offset="5903443">Second, the text of each provision has an ordinary and accepted meaning that is not, in fact, the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.108" offset="5937820">Third, there are at least three reasons why Congress logically used a different trigger for the limitation periods in section 2244 and 2255, and fourth, no harmful or absurd consequences flow from a determination that Congress did not intend these very different provisions with their very different texts to mean precisely the same thing, as the parties here contend, and for these reasons, I submit the judgment of the court of appeals in this case is correct, and it should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.621" offset="6067910">The Russello presumption in this case is particularly strong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.438" offset="6091107">Congress, in fact, used three different formulations in AEDPA in identifying triggers for time limitations under the statute, 2244, 2255, as we've talked about, and also 2263.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.955" offset="6149203">In each of those formulations, enacted in the same statute at the same time, Congress explicitly chose different words to describe what the triggering event was and what the consequences of subsequent events were.</text>

            <text syncTime="1730.649" offset="7064011">That is, if someone actually files a petition for cert, then the finality rule would not kick in.</text>

            <text syncTime="1741.953" offset="7109256">It is not clear that Congress in 2255 intended either formulation to be the defining point in all cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.301" offset="7146558">Under Rule 33, there was very similar language that triggered a time bar to... to when the judgment became final and, as interpreted by the courts there, finality was not always coextensive with the conclusion of direct review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.437" offset="7219179">The rule there, universally established, was that if a court of appeals issued its mandate and a stay of the mandate was not obtained, the 2-year clock under Rule 33 began to run from the date of the mandate whether or not the defendant, not having obtained a stay, petitioned this Court for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.808" offset="7304651">So although the question is not presented in this case, it is not automatically clear that Congress in 2255 meant either of the triggers that appear in 2244, but, as this Court recognized in Russello, these provisions do not need to be mutually coextensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.704" offset="7388243">One can be a subset of the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.541" offset="7395558">In this instance, Congress could include the words, the conclusion of direct review, simply to provide clarity that it also wanted to include the unusual event, which was the expiration of the time for seeking such review.</text>

            <text syncTime="2495.329" offset="10122741">The most analogous rule, as it existed both under the Speedy Trial Act and under Rule 33, was that simply petitioning this Court for certiorari did not automatically arrest the finality of a judgment for either of those two statutes: only if you got a stay of the mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.933" offset="10197138">That's the whole purpose under Rule 41(c) for providing for a stay of the mandate; and, of course, it's that rule that the simple filing of a petition, that's what may engender meritorious petitions, which the Government contends is a reason not to interpret 2255 the way the court of appeals did below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.173" offset="10274147">It makes sense, I submit, not to have a rule that the automatic filing arrests the finality of the judgment, and that was, in fact, the rule under Rule 33, and that's the way the Speedy Trial Act has been interpreted, and other statutes of limitations, that the filing for cert does not automatically trigger the... or disrupt the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2572.170" offset="10430046">Yes, but first I must correct you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.044" offset="10437569">Under this overall statutory scheme, I submit Federal prisoners have more time, not less, and the reason for that, it is wrong for the parties to argue, as they do, that this construction of 2255 is necessary to ensure parity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.716" offset="10512279">There is no parity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.294" offset="10518549">As the Court knows from its decision in Duncan versus Walker, and just last term in Carey versus Saffold, the 1-year statute under 2244 applies to the preparation of two different things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.663" offset="10568077">It applies to the preparation of your State collateral petition, and then once that is filed, but only after it's filed, there is tolling, as was at issue in Duncan versus Walker and Carey versus Saffold; and then after the State petition is resolved, but not including certiorari, that's very clear, then you've got to file your Federal 2254 petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.733" offset="10660341">So a State inmate has one year to do both, prepare his State collateral claim, assuming total exhaustion under Rose versus Lundy, and then, after the State collateral petition is resolved, the Federal collateral petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.294" offset="10714571">The Federal inmate, by contrast, has a full year simply to bring his 2255 motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.701" offset="10740171">So it is not true that only by forcing this different language in 2244 and 2255 to mean the same thing, will you achieve parity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.581" offset="10779773">There isn't parity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.982" offset="10785311">Federal inmates have more time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.116" offset="10793879">But there are, in any event, reasons for that difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.276" offset="10806522">Again, claims coming from State court by definition must be exhausted, previously litigated claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.424" offset="10839123">By definition, 2255 claims cannot be the same claims that were litigated on direct review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.215" offset="10866291">I submit it makes logical sense for Congress to allow the State claim, previously litigated in State court, to run its full course at least through cert on direct review before starting the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.545" offset="10919580">If this... and I submit Teague here really provides a reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.238" offset="10942359">Since this Court has recognized that if it were to issue a new rule of constitutional procedure before the time expired to file for cert, and if one of the petitioner's State claims was litigated on direct review, it is less an affront to the State system for this Court to simply grant, vacate, and remand than for a lower Federal court to take up that claim on habeas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.012" offset="11045491">So Congress logically could have said that the time to begin the statute will not run until the expiration of time for the conclusion of direct review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.574" offset="11079659">There are reasons such as that that could provide an explanation for why Congress did what it did, which is to provide very different triggers in these two statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.472" offset="11123336">Fourth, it's important that there are no harmful consequences that follow from granting these two different provisions, with their very different text, different meanings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.599" offset="11195851">As I mentioned, Federal defendants will always have at least one full year from the issuance of the mandate to bring their claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.071" offset="11225736">As this Court has recognized, in a non-capital case, the defendant has no interest in delaying the adjudication of any collateral claims that may exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.146" offset="11265964">The construction of the court of appeals in this case is clear and easy to administer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.280" offset="11286549">The Federal inmate has one year from the issuance of the mandate if not--</text>

            <text syncTime="2814.204" offset="11398248">The courts of appeals have held universally that if you petition for cert, the 1-year period does not begin to run until the petition is resolved, and that rule is not presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.507" offset="11459479">There is, in fact... authority goes both ways, that subsequent filings in a different court at times do arrest the finality of a prior judgment, and at times they do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.202" offset="11518202">My only point was, in looking at the language of 2244 and asking whether the language there, the conclusion of direct review defeats the Russello presumption, my point simply is, it does not defeat it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.559" offset="11579642">One interpretation is that Congress didn't mean either to apply here, and instead embraced a rule much like the established practice under Rule 33, but even if... the Court does not need to accept that to affirm the court of appeals here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.464" offset="11643277">The rule logically could be that if the court of appeals issues its mandate, the case is over in the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.887" offset="11676922">Nothing else happens, no motion to stay, no petition for cert. The case is final.</text>

            <text syncTime="2958.038" offset="11973569">There... there are established rules that a judgment is final, but yet, if you file a motion for reconsideration, for instance, the finality of the judgment, even though it was final and the time bars were running, finality is arrested; and then once the petition for reconsideration is decided, you have a full period, again, and so Justice Ginsburg, that would be a perfectly permissible construction, and in fact, perhaps the most logical construction, that if you petition for cert, the finality of the judgment is arrested and you have a full year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.149" offset="12101987">The point is, finality will always be affected by what the defendant does and does not do, and there will always be a series of different rules, depending on whether a petition for cert was filed, whether an appeal was filed, and there will be different rules from State as well as Federal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.447" offset="12163218">There's a whole series of different rules; but the rule of the court of appeals in this case was, if nothing happens after the court of appeals issues its decision, the judgment is final within the meaning of 2255.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.654" offset="12215985">That's consistent with the fact that judgments routinely are final without being dependent upon the expiration of the time for review.</text>

            <text syncTime="3139.826" offset="12700714">Mr. Chief Justice, there were no contrary cases, you're quite right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.256" offset="12710431">This Court never passed on it, and there's no contrary authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.599" offset="12719835">And so my point is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.727" offset="12728299">Even under Rule 33, it could mean a lot of different things, and I do think it's perfectly clear that among all the analogies, the closest one is this Court's collateral review precedents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.358" offset="12770826">I do want to pick up on Justice Breyer's and... and the Chief Justice's question about, well, didn't they explicate something in 2244 that they didn't in 2255, and if I could give a contrary... give a hypothetical where I think that reasoning would apply, if 2255 said, when the judgment of conviction becomes final by the expiration of direct... by the conclusion of direct review, it would be very difficult for a 2255 petitioner to say,</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.329" offset="12870718">"and that includes the time for seeking cert. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.538" offset="12879600">because then you would have a real contrast with 2244.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.478" offset="12891303">You would have one of the phrases in 55, but both in 44, and there you could have a genuine inference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.569" offset="12915649">Here we don't have anything, and my point is that this silence is not pregnant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.261" offset="12934457">You don't draw the inference that Congress meant nothing at all, or that Congress meant... as Justice Scalia points out, an even narrower universe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.830" offset="12964759">The final point I want to make is about--</text>

            <text syncTime="3223.514" offset="13035499">Justice Scalia's point is that look, if you use the word by, it could either mean it's explicating things, or more naturally it means, we've picked a subset, and so you don't have the subset here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3235.487" offset="13083355">Interest in an enterprise is a... a smaller part of the bigger ball.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.310" offset="13094640">The final point is about policy reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.415" offset="13103104">There really is no reason Congress would have intended this period of time, the time when you could have sought cert but didn't, to be available to a State prisoner versus a... a Federal prisoner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.226" offset="13146362">There's no explanation given by amicus that makes any sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.630" offset="13155976">For example, GVRs apply only when a cert petition is filed.</text>
