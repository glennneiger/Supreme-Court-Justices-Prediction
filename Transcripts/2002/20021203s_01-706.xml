            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="84942">I have the opinion to announce in No. 01-706, Sprietsma against The Brunswick Corporation, a case that comes to us from the Supreme Court of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.443" offset="134679">Petitioner's wife suffered fatal injuries when she fell off a motorboat and was struck by its propeller.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.604" offset="163309">Petitioner brought a state law tort suit against respondent, the manufacturer of the motorboat alleging that it had manufactured an unreasonably dangerous product, because, among other things, the motor was not protected by a propeller guard.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.812" offset="228093">The State Court's held that the action was preempted by the Federal Boat Safety Act, a statute enacted by Congress in 1971 to improve the safe operation of recreational boats.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.550" offset="283055">The statute gives the Secretary of Transportation authority which has been delegated to the Coast Guard to issue regulations establishing minimum safety standards for recreational vessels and associated equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.066" offset="341151">We granted certiorari to decide whether petitioner's action is preempted either by the federal statute itself or by a decision of the Coast Guard in 1990 not to promulgate a regulation requiring propeller guards on motorboats.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.744" offset="407815">For reasons stated in a unanimous opinion filed with the Clerk, we hold that petitioner's action is not preempted and therefore reverse the judgment of the Illinois Supreme Court.</text>
