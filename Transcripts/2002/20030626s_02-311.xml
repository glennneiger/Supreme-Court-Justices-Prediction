            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="85353">The second case I have to announce is No. 02-311, Wiggins versus Smith which comes on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.634" offset="139792">In 1989, the petitioner, Kevin Wiggins was convicted of capital murder by a Maryland judge and was sentenced to death by a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.936" offset="181066">The Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.569" offset="191619">Represented by new counsel, petitioner sought state post conviction relief arguing that trial counsel had rendered ineffective assistance by failing to investigate and present mitigating evidence of his troubled childhood.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.623" offset="251805">To support his claim that petitioner presented testimony by a social worker who discussed petitioner's long history of privation and physical as well as sexual abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.213" offset="298199">The State Court denied the petitioner relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.453" offset="311155">The Maryland Court of Appeals emphasized that counsel did investigate petitioner's childhood concluding that counsel had made a legitimate tactical decision to challenge petitioner's direct responsibility for the murder rather than to present the mitigation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.586" offset="379596">Petitioner then sought habeas relief in Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.052" offset="397464">The Federal Court granted the writ but the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that counsel had made a reasonable strategic decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.033" offset="437484">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we reverse the decision of the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.022" offset="461412">To prevail on an ineffective assistance claim, the petitioner must show that counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that the deficiency prejudice his defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.348" offset="518672">Our principal concern in evaluating petitioner's claim is not whether a counsel should have presented a mitigation case, but whether the investigation that counsel directed supporting that decision, not to introduce mitigating evidence was itself reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.520" offset="595368">In our review of petitioner's claim as circumscribed by the requirements of 28 United States Code Section 2254, which authorizes Federal Courts to grant habeas relief only if a State Court decision was contrary to or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.875" offset="680840">Counsels investigation of petitioner's life history fell below the performance standard set by Strickland versus Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.641" offset="715844">Counsel's investigation consisted of two sources that contained only a fraction of the mitigating evidence revealed during state post conviction proceeding, a pre-sentence investigation report and a state social services record.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.793" offset="776449">Counsel's decision to end their investigation with these sources was neither consistent with the professional standards that prevailed in 1989, nor reasonable in light of the evidence contained in the records.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.856" offset="832769">Evidence that would have led a reasonably competent attorney to investigate further.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.696" offset="856070">In assuming that counsel's investigation met Strickland standards and in deferring that counsel's strategic decision despite the unreasonable underlying investigation, the Maryland Court of Appeals unreasonably applied Strickland.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.793" offset="924511">Section 2254(d) therefore poses no bar to the relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.362" offset="946767">Given the nature in the extent of the available mitigating evidence, we also find that counsel's deficient performance, prejudiced petitioner's defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.176" offset="986055">There is a reasonable probability that a competent attorney aware of this evidence would have introduced it at sentencing in an admissible form.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.370" offset="1022731">Moreover, had the jury been able to place petitioner's bleak history on the mitigating side of the scale, there is a reasonable probability that at least one juror would have struck a different balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.594" offset="1067662">Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.950" offset="1081141">The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.747" offset="1100262">Justice Scalia has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Thomas has joined.</text>
