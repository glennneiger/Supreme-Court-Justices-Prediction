            <text syncTime="7.085" offset="113855">The Alaska Sex Offender Registration Act requires convicted sex offenders to register with law enforcement authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.447" offset="147291">We must decide if the Act is retroactive punishment that is prohibited by the Ex Post Facto Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.303" offset="174668">Neither States nor the Federal Government can enact an Ex Post Facto law.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.808" offset="192745">The Alaska law requires any sex offender present in the State to register and provide his name, address, place of employment, and other information even if the offense was out of State if the offender moves to Alaska, the offender is required to register.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.068" offset="253767">Some of the information is kept confidential but most is made available to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.585" offset="271843">Now, both of these respondents were convicted of the sexual abuse to the minor which is an aggravated sex offense in the State of Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.656" offset="300160">They challenge the Act's retroactive application as unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.749" offset="316460">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed and invalidated the statute as to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.801" offset="332656">We granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.082" offset="341851">The framework for our Ex Post Facto inquiry is well established.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.265" offset="358570">First, the Court must ascertain whether the legislature meant to enact a civil regulatory scheme; second, even if that intent is present, we examine whether the Act is so punitive in effect as to negate the State's intention to deem it civil.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.726" offset="424398">In ascertaining the legislative intent, we consider the statute's text and structure, here the statute sets forth the legislative findings that sex offenders pose a high risk of reoffending that protecting the public from sex offenders is the law's primary interest, and that release of certain information about sex offenders will assist the public safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.414" offset="503184">We have held in an imposition of restrictive measures on sex offenders that judged to be dangerous is a legitimate, non-punitive governmental objective and the text of the statute suggest us that in this case, the legislator sought to create a civil scheme designed to protect the public from harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.350" offset="574864">Also, probative of the legislature's intent is the manner of the statute's codification.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.032" offset="593567">The notification provisions of the Act are codified in Alaska's Health Safety and Housing Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.797" offset="616660">This confirms our conclusion that the statute was inteded as a non-punitive regulatory measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.184" offset="646230">On the other hand, the Act's registration provisions are codified in the State's criminal procedure code and this might seem to point in the opposite direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.436" offset="679249">The location and labels of the statutory provision do not however by themselves transform a civil remedy into a criminal one and the partial codification of the Act in the State's criminal procedure code does not negate our conclusion that this is a civil, not a criminal scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.467" offset="747376">In analyzing the effects of the Act, we first consider whether in our nation's history and traditions the regulatory scheme has been regarded as punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.597" offset="775902">Sex offenders registration statutes are fairly recent origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.894" offset="793038">Any initial resemblance to the shaming punishments of the colonial period is misleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.711" offset="820310">In contrast to those punishments, the Act's stigma results not from public display for ridicule, but from the dissemination of accurate information about a criminal record, most of which is already public.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.906" offset="869107">Second, the Act does not subject respondent's to an affirmative disability or restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.522" offset="887602">The Act does not require the updates to be made in person.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.732" offset="900454">The registration system does not resemble probation or supervise release because the registrants are free to move where they wish and to live and work with other citizens with no supervision or need for prior permission from authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.565" offset="955729">Third, the Act does not promote the traditional aims of punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.873" offset="968999">The fact that it might deter future crimes is not as positive as any number of regulatory programs might deter crime without imposing punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.850" offset="1000869">The Act's registration obligations are not retributive.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.197" offset="1022289">Fourth, the Act has a rational connection to a legitimate non-punitive purpose of public safety which is advanced by alerting the public to the risk of sex offenders in their community.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.114" offset="1061891">Fifth, the regulation is not excessive with respect to its non-punitive purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.864" offset="1080908">Alaska may legislate with respect to convicted sex offenders as a class rather than require individual determination of their dangerousness, because the conviction for a sex offense provides evidence of substantial risk of recidivism.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.009" offset="1137541">Why dissemination is easy accessibility of the offender information does not render the Act excessive given the general mobility of our population and the passive nature of the notification system.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.785" offset="1184666">The regulatory means chosen are reasonable in light of the non-punitive objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.906" offset="1209117">Respondents cannot show, much less by the clearest proof which is what our precedents require that the effects of the Act negate the State's intention to establish a civil regulatory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.896" offset="1253107">The Act is non-punitive and its retroactive application does not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.957" offset="1277349">The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed and the case is remanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.102" offset="1297933">Justice Thomas has filed a concurring opinion; Justice Souter has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment; Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion; Justice Ginsburg has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Breyer joins.</text>
