            <text syncTime="1016.260" offset="4202808">Local governments apply for and use Federal funds for the benefit of their residents and, as this Court noted in Stevens, in City of Newport, the Court was concerned with the imposition of punitive damages on local taxpayers under any circumstances, and here we have a statute that imposes three times the amount of damages and imposes statutory fines, which get very hefty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.263" offset="4302804">Punitive damages against a local government have got to come from someplace, and there are only two places, reduction in services, or an increase in taxes, and the victims of punitive damages are not the wrongdoers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.571" offset="4364035">They're... they're the innocent, and some of those innocents are not even taxpayers or voters, such as schoolchildren or homeless medically indigent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.484" offset="4395696">The United States significantly... significantly has other means to stop fraud by local governments, and to deter local governments from committing fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.783" offset="4444910">The United States has common law causes of action to be made whole, and the most effective deterrent is the threat of debarment from participation in Federal funding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.069" offset="4498096">With no indication that Congress ever intended to include local governments in the... in the 1863 act, and with the Dictionary Act not being enacted until 1871, where Congress for the first time created a statutory presumption that the word, person, includes bodies politic and corporate, this case is in a very different posture from the Monell case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1151.385" offset="4743333">A review of the circumstances around the 1863 enactment, together with the text and the historical context, leads the other way.</text>

            <text syncTime="1204.292" offset="4954925">I really can't contribute much more to the discussion of what Congress meant by a person in section... in 1863, other than to point out, as we did in our brief, that in fact, the law in the States prior to Letson... and... and indeed, Letson is the origin of the... of the doctrine, because in Letson, what the Court actually said was, a corporation is a natural person for purposes of the suit where it's incorporated or where it does business, and the Court then goes on and says, and that doctrine also applies to all corporations and body politic.</text>

            <text syncTime="1253.923" offset="5153456">The... that's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.943" offset="5157531">They... they defined corporations by the... by the members, and... and they could have jurisdictions all over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.552" offset="5183967">That then gets cleared up, and... and the law was absolutely clear in all of the States as we... that we could find.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.646" offset="5216359">We found no dissenting opinions that... that held, that didn't hold that a local government, whether it was a corporation, whether it was a quasi corporation, a city, a county, wasn't held responsible for any obligations it had, whether by contract, whether by charter, whether... whether by statute, wherever they came from, and they were also responsible for all their wrongful torts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.544" offset="5311967">So that then brings us to really what was Ms. Lach's starting point, this whole question of the implications of the criminal provisions and, in fact, not only the Sherman Act, but the Elkins Act also includes criminal provisions, and this Court has recognized that person, in that act, includes municipal corporations, but the... the question of what is the significance of including criminal penalties in 1863 has to be answered in the context of what was... what was the... the view in 1863.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.096" offset="5462223">Unfortunately, this argument really doesn't surface until the reply, and so we haven't had a chance really to brief it, but the simple reality is, in... in the period of 18... in the era of 1863, indeed in the 19th Century, local governments were treated just like private corporations, and they were, indeed, subject to indictment, and they were subject to criminal punishment on the same terms as local governments, and they were often found liable for acts that involved both fraud and deceit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.398" offset="5595343">Since... since this was... now, I'd like to read to the Court from Dillon, who is cited repeatedly as... as one of the... the scholars of the era, although we... we have not cited this passage because the issue hadn't come up before, but in his treatise on the law of municipal corporations he states, English law, and in this country... in the English law and in this country, quote, all corporations, municipal as well as private, which owe duties to the public are liable to indictment for malfeasance as well as nonfeasance in respect to their duties.</text>

            <text syncTime="2164.463" offset="8795657">The False Claims Act is the primary mechanism for addressing deliberate efforts to cheat the Federal Government out of money and property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.077" offset="8822092">Petitioner has identified no legitimate ground for excluding local governments from the coverage of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.880" offset="8841319">Local governments receive very substantial amounts of Federal money, and fraud by local governments causes precisely the same harms as comparable misconduct committed by a private party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.756" offset="8880816">Moreover, local governments are presumptively encompassed by the term, person, and qui tam suits against local governments raise no constitutional concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.718" offset="8916656">Now, with respect to the 1863 act, to begin, it's true that as of 1863, there was no square holding of this Court to the effect that a municipal corporation would presumptively be treated as a person for purposes of Federal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.801" offset="8976946">However, given the materials available at that time, Congress would certainly have reasonably concluded that municipalities were covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.593" offset="9008189">As Justice Souter pointed out, as early as 1826, this Court quoted with approval Lord Cook's observation to the effect that the term, person, presumptively includes both municipal and private corporations and, again, because fraud by municipal corporations in the procurement of Federal--</text>

            <text syncTime="2241.526" offset="9103901">There was no square holding to that effect, but certainly all the indications in the Court's opinions would have supported Congress in its view that the term, person, would include local governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.543" offset="9147996">The... the Court in Monell held that as of 1871 a clear understanding to that effect had been established, and petitioner has identified no evidence that would suggest that the prevailing consensus changed during the years between 1863 and 1871.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.144" offset="9214347">It... it may also be the case that, as Justice Ginsburg suggested, the question would have been a largely academic one in 1863, because local governments wouldn't have received a significant amount of Federal money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.411" offset="9263457">The Congress deliberately drafted the act in a broad fashion so that it would encompass spending programs that were adopted in the future, even if they were unknown in 1863, and... and the Court--</text>

            <text syncTime="2306.038" offset="9361991">I'm saying Congress wrote the statute in a way that would cover whatever spending programs came to be adopted in ensuing years, and... and the Court addressed essentially that situation in U.S. ex rel. Marcus versus Hess, in which it said the type of financial assistance that we're dealing with here would not have been undertaken in 1863, yet Congress drafted the act broadly, and these funds are in... as much in need of protection as other Federal money, and Congress did, in some significant, some relatively minor respects, continue to amend the False Claims Act at intervals during the period between 1863 and 1986, and during that period, it became increasingly apparent that local governments were beginning to receive enhanced shares of Federal money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.212" offset="9562612">It also became increasingly apparent that the term, person would be construed generally to encompass local governments, yet Congress retained the word, person, even as it amended other features of the act, and I think petitioner's primary argument is that even if the statute included municipalities up to 1986, the 1986 amendments took local governments out of the act's coverage by adding a punitive component to the damages available, and... and this seems implausible for, essentially for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.946" offset="9689567">First, the whole thrust of the 1986 amendments generally was to make the act more effective, to expand its coverage, to give the Government greater weapons in fighting fraud, so it seems very unlikely that at the same time Congress would have removed from the act's coverage--</text>

            <text syncTime="2579.194" offset="10454537">Now, if we're correct about the law as it existed before 1986, that local governments were covered, and that they were subject to the double damages remedy that this Court had held to be essentially remedial, if Congress had wanted to exclude municipalities from the act's coverage, it... it really seems outlandish to think that Congress would have attempted to achieve that objective by leaving the word, person, in the act unchanged, and by amending the act's liability provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.582" offset="10568117">If Congress had believed that it was appropriate either to take the municipalities out of the scope of the act altogether, or at least to subject them to remedies less than those available against private corporations, the natural thing to do would have been to amend the act so to provide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.203" offset="10626631">It... it seems unlikely that Congress would have attempted to achieve that objective by so indirect a means.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.094" offset="10654217">The other point we would make is that there may be isolated situations in which an award of treble damages under the act will far exceed the harm that was done to the United States, but the alternative that petitioner contends we believe is much worse, because it would leave the act entirely unavailable for redressing all manner of fraud committed by local governments against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.080" offset="10754109">When we have a contract action, when we have an ordinary suit of a dispute about money, and we regard it as a good faith controversy, even if we prevail at the end of the day, it's often the case that the United States won't be made completely whole, because we incur costs of investigation, costs of prosecuting the suit, we may lose the time value of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.638" offset="10836342">When we're dealing with good faith disputes, Congress and the executive branch have been content to treat that undercompensation simply as a cost of doing business.</text>

            <text syncTime="2784.763" offset="11276871">The first point I'd like to address is Mr. Miner's point that local governments were sued in all types of tort actions across the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.644" offset="11316368">Congress' understanding of the suability of municipalities, and municipalities as persons in 1863 was really dependent on State law, because there had been no Federal expression up until that time, and across the board in the States, local governments were viewed differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.262" offset="11382824">Some... some local governments were viewed as quasi corporations and some as municipal corporations with different levels of liability and, as I noted earlier, some States made a distinction between proprietary and Government functions, so Congress' understanding based on State law at that time was not consistent enough to be evidence that Congress understood person to include local governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.370" offset="11483239">As for State criminal actions, in some States there were misdemeanor actions against local governments for nuisance actions such as failure to maintain a bridge, but there is no common law with respect to... to Federal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.475" offset="11579683">When... when Congress enacts a criminal statute, the States' understanding of... of who is a person subject to State criminal statutes is not dispositive of what Congress had in mind, and if it is ambiguous and it is inconclusive, as Justice Breyer suggested, it might be what... what Congress was actually thinking in 1863.</text>

            <text syncTime="3148.273" offset="12730847">In that case, it is... in that scenario, the whistleblower is blowing the whistle on someone else and yet is employed by the local government and, under this... under the Court's reasoning in... in the Eighth Circuit case and in the two cases that we cited, Satalich and Erie County, an action can still proceed against a local government under 3730(h), even though a local government is not necessarily a person subject to suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.514" offset="12847875">To get... to get back to the points, a lawsuit under the False Claims Act can be brought if a statement is made in reckless disregard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.519" offset="12915898">Mr. Miner suggested that the statement has to be clearly false, deliberately false, and under the 1986 amendments, the standard has been reduced to reckless disregard.</text>

            <text syncTime="3229.444" offset="13055601">When... when in 1986 Congress expanded the coverage of the False Claims Act, it did not expand the fraudsters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.258" offset="13114847">As this Court noted in Stevens, the False Claims Act covers just all kinds of fraud, but it does not cover all kinds of fraudsters, and there's no indication, under our view, that local governments were among fraudsters that are included under this act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.728" offset="13176705">In response to Mr. Stewart, we are not aware of any dismissals of False Claims Act actions that are brought against local governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.910" offset="13217456">The... the Government has not intervened, obviously, in... in a number of these False Claims Act actions, but we're not aware of any situation in which the Government has actually dismissed a claim against a local government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.089" offset="13274194">These actions proceed and, even if... even if the United States wanted to dismiss an action, they would have to justify their dismissal before the court, and the same with a settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.590" offset="13328110">It has to be approved by the court. In sum, I would like to say that Congress knows what language it needs to impose punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.061" offset="13366040">If this Court finds that local governments are included in the 1863 act, Congress did not use the requisite language to indicate that it meant to impose punitive damages on local governments in 1986.</text>
