            <text syncTime="81.015" offset="477629">The Coal Act states that the Commissioner of Social Security shall, before October 1st, 1993, assign each beneficiary to a signatory coal operator or related person that remains in business.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.317" offset="526844">That provision understood, in light of this Court's precedents, establishes the deadline that is mandatory but not jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.951" offset="557355">It does not deprive the commissioner of the power or the obligation to complete the assignments after that date, if necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.063" offset="589851">That understanding comports with the text and structure of the Coal Act, as well as with... with one of its central purposes, that to the maximum extent possible, each coal retiree's benefits would be paid for by a coal operator that actually employed that miner or a related person.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>

            <text syncTime="129.305" offset="670726">In fact, if later research has showed that somebody should have been assigned somewhere else, you... you don't shift the beneficiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.838" offset="708865">It... it isn't the case that... that this is designed to assure a perfect system in which somebody who is responsible, no matter that a mistake was made in the past, in the future that person will be reassigned the way he should be.</text>

            <label>Ms. Barbara B. McDowell</label>
            <text syncTime="156.954" offset="781381">Well, the statute does provide for administrative review of assignment so that a coal operator who was assigned a miner in error could challenge that before the commissioner, and if the commissioner found that the assignment was erroneous, the miner could be assigned to a... a more appropriate coal operator.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.596" offset="847941">In addition, the regulations promulgated by the commissioner for the administrative review process allowed the commissioner herself to reopen an assignment if she found that it had been erroneous within a 1-year period.</text>

            <text syncTime="193.781" offset="928711">Congress did provide a fallback position for all of those who weren't assigned by October 1st or... or at any time because they had no former employer or related person who remained in business, and that is, that they will be treated as part of the unassigned beneficiary pool.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.205" offset="990360">The benefits for those miners are paid from an appropriation from the AML Fund, a fund originally created to ameliorate the problems of abandoned mines, and if that fund proves insufficient, the funds will come from a... a premium imposed on all of the coal operators to whom beneficiaries who have been assigned.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="232.320" offset="1082834">Ms. McDowell, there... there is a section, 9704(f)(2)(B), that deals with annual adjustment of unassigned premiums.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.099" offset="1125988">And it says that if there's an assigned miner and the operator goes out of business in any given year, then that assigned miner becomes part of the pool.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.312" offset="1174785">And it doesn't matter really whether the initial assignment was before the October 1 deadline or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.836" offset="1204878">They just go into the pool in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.885" offset="1213133">And that seems to work somewhat against your interpretation.</text>

            <text syncTime="270.150" offset="1234135">I think the situation addressed in that provision is quite different, even assuming that it unequivocally establishes that the commissioner couldn't reassign somebody after a company went into bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.114" offset="1278021">But assignments at the outset of the process, the sorts of assignments that we're concerned with here, are quite different from an assignment after bankruptcy that could occur 20, 30, or 40 years down the road, and Congress may well have been interested only in achieving a correct initial assignment at the outset and not with continuing to readjust the assignments--</text>

            <text syncTime="304.612" offset="1371957">Well, it does show at least that much, that Congress didn't want to continue perpetually to adjust these things for the--</text>

            <text syncTime="313.134" offset="1406125">But the fact that the... that Congress directed that the applicable percentage for calculating the assigned beneficiary premium shall be adjusted in certain circumstances doesn't suggest to us that Congress would not have permitted it to be adjust in other... adjusted in other circumstances as well that Congress may not have explicitly contemplated at the time that the Coal Act was enacted.</text>

            <text syncTime="353.354" offset="1566935">And indeed, since Congress was legislating in light of this Court's opinions in Pierce County and Montalvo-Murillo, the provision could not readily be understood as providing coal operators with that sort of assurance.</text>

            <text syncTime="417.824" offset="1824816">That's simply a message to the agency to get going.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.738" offset="1836519">And we... I think we said quite properly that didn't mean that you couldn't ferret out this sort of thing after the 4 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.861" offset="1860969">But this thing has... has somewhat different ramifications, I think.</text>

            <text syncTime="430.840" offset="1876956">Well, I think it's clear that Congress imposed deadlines, not only this deadline, but other deadlines in the statute, because it wanted to get the new funding mechanism established by the Coal Act into place.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.642" offset="1920110">Congress wanted the assignments to be made promptly so that the Combined Fund could then send bills for premiums to assigned operators.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.202" offset="1950413">But it wasn't essential to that scheme that every last assignment was made by October 1st, and there's no indication that Congress adopted the deadline in order to provide any sort of certainty to coal operators.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.108" offset="1997955">To paraphrase the Court's decision in James Daniel Good, it would seem somewhat curious that a deadline that was intended to expedite the collection of premiums by the Combined Fund could be construed to prevent the Combined Fund in some circumstances from collecting premiums at all.</text>
