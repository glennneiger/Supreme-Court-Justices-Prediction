            <text syncTime="1597.809" offset="6515191">He... as was later acknowledged, Judge Sand had been perhaps misled by certain representations made by the Archdiocese of New York and therefore he did not include a provision that would allow for a subsequent injunction or... or a retention of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.513" offset="6574019">That may have led the court in that circumstance to invoke All Writs Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1717.765" offset="6995008">I would credit, Justice Ginsburg, that it may have been equally appropriate to go back to the Federal court, seek a declaratory judgment or some kind of decision in that fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.994" offset="7035864">But I believe that this course was certainly honest and forthright on the part of counsel below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.945" offset="7055717">I... I hardly think it may be necessary to indicate that the All Writs Act does not confer jurisdiction under 1441, as was already made clear in certainly the questioning and certainly in view of petitioners' discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.303" offset="7113081">Original jurisdiction has always been required and has been upheld in countless cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.055" offset="7132099">And moreover, the All Writs Act textually demands that Federal courts issue writs, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.196" offset="7148712">"in aid of their respective jurisdiction. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.556" offset="7158117">Petitioners' argument essentially would read out 1651.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.498" offset="7193957">Clearly the All Writs Act does not independently grant original jurisdiction, and this has been consistently upheld by this Court for nearly 200 years from the McIntire decision in 1813 to as recently as Clinton v. Goldsmith in 1999.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.919" offset="7251635">Moreover, issuance of writs under the All Writs Act is certainly conditioned by the statutory requirement that such be necessary or appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.670" offset="7286639">And as this Court indicated in Pennsylvania Bureau of Corrections, this is essentially a threshold requirement for invocation of the All Writs Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.554" offset="7322166">And in the Goldsmith case, as recently as 3 or 4 years ago, this Court made clear that the All Writs Act can't be used as a form of cure-all to... to fix what would otherwise be the availability of other statutory mechanisms which are not otherwise complied with.</text>

            <text syncTime="1864.368" offset="7581405">And other courts of appeals that have so held have indicated that there are profound federalism concerns that are implicated in allowing essentially a common law writ of removal to be used to evade what is Congress's role in dictating the mechanism for removal and... and patrolling the boundary and the balance of authority between State courts and Federal courts in this country.</text>

            <text syncTime="1964.746" offset="7982855">And as this Court clearly said in the Pennsylvania Bureau of Corrections case, although the All Writs Act empowers Federal courts to fashion extraordinary remedies when the need arises, it does not authorize them to issue ad hoc writs whenever compliance with statutory procedures appears inconvenient or less appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.722" offset="8054848">If I can say just a word or two about ancillary enforcement jurisdiction, to the extent to which petitioners appear to be relying on it.</text>
