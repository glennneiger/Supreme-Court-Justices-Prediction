            <text syncTime="56.823" offset="369056">The complaint in this case alleges that a national bank charged excessive interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.571" offset="392044">This Court has held repeatedly and consistently since 1875 that section 30 of the National Bank Act of 1864 provides both the exclusive standards governing the interest that a national bank may charge and the exclusive judicial remedies for any violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.957" offset="473546">And as a result, any claim that a national bank charged excessive interest necessarily arises under Federal law, whether that claim is brought in State court or Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.819" offset="529030">Any well-pleaded complaint would reflect that, and therefore, any claim of usury against a national bank, whether pleaded well or mistakenly or deceptively, falls within the original jurisdiction of the Federal courts and may either be filed there by a plaintiff or removed there by a defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="550.335" offset="2343078">Mr. Waxman, one thing that troubles me about... about the proposal that you make and that the Government makes is that it seems to me in the LMRA case that established this principle and in the ERISA case, which is the only other case that has... has held to the same effect, those cases refer to this as being an extraordinary, an unusual event.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.756" offset="2456762">But I don't think it's going to be an unusual event if we say that whenever there is created a Federal cause of action, and at the same time, State causes of action are preempted, it may be removed to Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.913" offset="2513396">I don't think that will be unusual at all--</text>
            <text syncTime="594.277" offset="2518829">And I sort of looked upon the... the Labor Management Relations Act case as really sort of a... a platypus, I mean, a very strange case in which the courts just didn't want these labor things to go into State courts because they didn't trust State courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.245" offset="2586748">And so they said, boy, we're going to have Federal courts create this whole new law of... of contracting, of collective bargaining.</text>

            <text syncTime="864.792" offset="3600926">The very difficult... this Court made clear in Metropolitan Life, if it wasn't clear before, that it wasn't going to infer from congressional silence very lightly that when Congress created a Federal cause of action, it meant it to be exclusive so that it would displace State causes of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.485" offset="3679711">There's a very strong and longstanding presumption to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.701" offset="3692563">But that difficult question was decided in the context of section 30 of the National Bank Act beginning in 1875 for reasons that are explained in this Court's opinion and in the Comptroller's report that the Government cites that precipitated the enactment of section 30, which is that this was war legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.661" offset="3780335">This was a... the creation of the national banks was hoped by Congress and President Lincoln that it would provide the means with which the Government could continue to fund the war, and national banks would knit the country together when the war was finished.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.495" offset="3843760">And the one thing that comes out of the history of this case and is reflected in this Court's opinions is that they feared, based on their experience with the first bank of the United States and the second bank of the United States, that jealous States, States that were jealous of their State-chartered banks, which were issuing paper at the time, would engage in predations against the national banks that were created at the very same time that section 30 was enacted and, in essence, smother this important Federal infant in its crib.</text>

            <text syncTime="3044.578" offset="12320077">And the answer to that is this Court has provided, for right or for wrong, since 1887 that we follow the well-pleaded complaint rule and it follows the language in the... at the end of the Gully opinion saying that what you need is a clear bright line limitation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3096.986" offset="12529683">--Your question was if... if you... you said this would take time, and it will.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.871" offset="12545252">You pleaded all the elements of a Federal cause of action, but it also... it also satisfies a State cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.330" offset="12571061">If the Federal cause of action is not exclusive except in that rare instance, it is not removable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.150" offset="12594362">Justice Breyer, yes, indeed we say that you stop at point 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.860" offset="12613171">That is, you determine whether or not this is the rare instance in which there's not only substantive preemption but exclusive Federal remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.594" offset="12648070">And the reason you stop is because we have Federal question jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.609" offset="12664162">It says that removal is tied to original jurisdiction, and therefore, the question is, does the complaint well-pleaded necessarily state a cause of action?</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.916" offset="12709406">Justice Holmes indicated in a statement that is oft repeated and, if it's anything, is under-inclusive, as this Court indicated I think in Merrell Dow, that a suit arises under the law that creates the cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.054" offset="12761964">If the cause of action is exclusively Federal, in that rare instance, it's under arising-under jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.688" offset="12788504">Justice Kennedy I think asked what for me is the most difficult question in this Court's sometimes not fully explicated arising-under jurisdiction, which is the question that was addressed in Merrell Dow and in particular in footnote 1 in this Court's opinion in Merrell Dow, which is if you have a State cause of action misrepresentation, but it has embedded with it as a necessary matter a conclusion about whether Federal law was or was not satisfied, does that State claim arise under Federal jurisdiction?</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.784" offset="12948896">In Franchise Tax Board, this Court repeated dicta that suggests that the answer is yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.115" offset="12974183">And in Smith versus Kansas City Title and Trust, this... this Court seemed to indicate yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.321" offset="12999051">But in Moore versus Chesapeake... the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway, the Court suggested that the embedded Federal question has to be central to the State cause of action and really important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.790" offset="13056939">And the result, as I... as I think things stand now, is we have a very long footnote 1 in this Court's opinion in Merrell Dow that says many people have difficulty resolving our jurisprudence in this area, but in the Merrell Dow context, where there was a State tort claim that could... may I finish my--</text>
