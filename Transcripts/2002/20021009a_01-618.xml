            <text syncTime="12.558" offset="193992">Petitioners are before you this morning challenging Congress's 1998 Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, which extended the term of subsisting and future copyrights by 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.783" offset="238923">Petitioners submit such a blanket extension of existing terms exceeds Congress's power under the Copyright Clause and it violates the First Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3184.446" offset="12881561">But compare that to the 1793 Patent Act under the same clause, where there is that exchange there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.448" offset="12909564">The other thing, as this Court has said, there is no implied abrogation of common law rights which would be a doctrine which would be inconsistent with what the petitioner is arguing.</text>

            <text syncTime="3210.387" offset="12985319">That is, suppose you have a statute, as this one arguably is, where 99.9 percent, many billions of dollars of benefits, are going to the existing holders of copyright on grounds of equity, and the effect of the statute in eliciting new works is near zero.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.202" offset="13056581">I mean, that would seem... where this equity idea is the camel and the production idea is the gnat, and is there any... can we say something like that, or does Congress have total leeway in respect to--</text>

            <text syncTime="3244.499" offset="13121783">--Justice Breyer, it's conceivable that the Court might do that if that situation was present, but it's not remotely the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.555" offset="13149995">We have the adoption of copyright terms which are consistent, generally speaking, with copyright terms which exist in the European Union, our principal competitor, and in connection with international treaties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.621" offset="13202240">We have a copyright term that's consistent with the concept of the creator plus the creator's first generation heirs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.933" offset="13231497">We have a copyright term, remember, which supersedes the earlier copyright provisions that were added to the period between creation and publication, so that the limited number of years in the first, the 1790 and the 1831 statute were the number of years plus the relatively unlimited period of time between creation and publication, so we don't have anything remotely like that in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.576" offset="13354064">We have a process which, as you suggested, or one of the questions suggested, is... may not have been the policy that you as a Member of Congress would have supported.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.756" offset="13390844">You might have made the balance, that delicate balance that this Court has referred to, in another way, but that is something that Congress, through its ability to gather facts and make balances, is quintessentially capable of doing, and that is where the Framers vested the responsibility, and what this statute does is to favor, if at all, the creator with respect to the utilization of these rights, as opposed to the person who wishes to copy the creator.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.016" offset="13519889">That's an entirely rational distinction for Congress to make.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence Lessig</label>
            <text syncTime="3354.461" offset="13561581">General Olson has been perfectly clear in setting out the structure of the Government's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.134" offset="13588330">It is that there is no effective limit on Congress's power under the Copyright Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.373" offset="13609228">Now, were this the first time this Court had considered Congress's copyright authority, that might be a plausible argument, but the very first time this Court ever struck down a law of Congress as exceeding Article I, section 8 power was in the context of the Copyright Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.311" offset="13677042">We have 125 years of history of this Court making sure that the limits, both express and implied, in the Copyright Clause, have some meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.702" offset="13722599">The Feist opinion very clearly sets out the implied limits, a per se limit for originality, for the reasons Justice Breyer was trying to get me to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.356" offset="13761261">The Harper as well as Graham set out very clear limits on the context of the ability to extend works in the public domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.974" offset="13795638">Those limits make no sense under the reasoning the Government has offered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.755" offset="13818835">The Government's reasoning would make all of those opinions irrelevant and wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.217" offset="13840673">Now, we offer a simple way to make this clear, express limit make sense, and that is precisely the understanding we suggest that existed in 1790.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.820" offset="13887066">The only precedents that existed in 1790 were precedents of setting a term, and then when parliament was asked in 1735, '37, and '39 to extend it, they rejected it, and as amicus historians said, they rejected it because, as a pamphleteer described it, that would be effectively a perpetual term.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.822" offset="13967106">Now, this delicate balance that the Government invokes, Justice Breyer, let me give you the numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.753" offset="13990825">The delicate balance is that, under the most reasonable assumptions of copyright royalty income and under our interest rate of 7 percent, as the amicus economists note at page 6, note 6 of their brief, the current term gives authors 99.8 percent of the value of a perpetual term.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.054" offset="14084030">Now, that might be a delicate balance, that they give the author 99.8 percent and the public.2 percent, but in my mind, that's delicate in a very different sense of that term.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.341" offset="14129169">Thank you very much.</text>
