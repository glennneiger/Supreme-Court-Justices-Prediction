            <label>Mr. Paul M. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="51.286" offset="351051">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.779" offset="365053">The State of Texas in this case claims the right to criminally punish any unmarried adult couple for engaging in any form of consensual sexual intimacy that the State happens to disapprove of.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.973" offset="413745">It further claims that there's no constitutional problem raised by a criminal statute that is directed not just at conduct, but at a particular group of people, a law that criminalizes forms of sexual intimacy only for same-sex couples and not for anyone else in the State who has... has the right to make a free choice to engage in the identical conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.362" offset="507368">Petitioners are two adults who were arrested in a private home and criminally convicted simply because they engaged in one of the forms of sexual intimacy that is on the banned list in the State of Texas for same-sex couples.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.987" offset="561807">They bring two constitutional claims to the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.195" offset="578630">First, among the fundamental rights that are implicit in our concept of order of liberty, must be the right of all adult couples, whether same-sex or not, to be free from unwarranted State intrusion into their personal decisions about their preferred forms of sexual expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.740" offset="648847">Second, there's no legitimate and rational justification under the Equal Protection Clause for a law that regulates forms of sexual intimacy that are permitted in the State only for same-sex couples, thereby creating a kind of a second class citizenship to that group of people.</text>

            <text syncTime="151.336" offset="751247">Now you point to a trend in the other direction, which would be fine if you're talking about the Eighth Amendment, but I think our case is like Glucksberg, say, if you're talking about a right that is going to be sustained, it has to have been recognized for a long time.</text>

            <text syncTime="173.089" offset="838287">And I think that it's important to look at history as a whole and one of the errors that I think that the Court made in Bowers v. Hardwick was only looking at the issue in terms of homosexual sodomy and not looking at the issue in general terms, which is the right of everyone to decide for themselves about consensual private sexual intimacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.429" offset="907564">If you look at the history as a whole, you find a much more complicated picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.366" offset="923342">First of all, you find that sodomy was regulated going back to the founding for everyone and indeed the laws in the 19th century didn't focus on same-sex couples, they focused on particular--</text>

Justice Scalia, that it's been conceded here by this State, it was conceded by the State of Georgia 17 years ago, that married couples can't be regulated as a matter of substantive due process in their personal sexual expression in the home.</text>

            <text syncTime="314.668" offset="1404518">I think the Court in... has moved from Griswold to Eisenstadt... has moved in the contraception area outside of the marital context to the unmarried context, certainly the right... the qualified right to abortion applies to unmarried people, as well as married people.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.011" offset="1453941">And I think that the Court in... in looking at this issue of the scope of the fundamental right to make choices about sexual intimacy ought to take into account not just the state of law on the books in the 19th century but a couple of other factors, one the change in enforcement in the last 50 years because the Court's fundamental rights cases all do look at current laws, as well as 19th century law and also even in the 19th century, the fact that there's no record of active enforcement of these laws against conduct... of adults consensual occurring in the private setting and that's true for married couples, it's true for different-sex couples who weren't married, it's true for same-sex couples.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.426" offset="1595629">The enforcement of the sodomy laws of this country going back to the founding involves coercion, it involves children.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.281" offset="1623006">It involves public activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.683" offset="1628648">It doesn't involve the kind of conduct that's at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.564" offset="1644113">So you really have a tradition of respect for the privacy of couples in their... in their home, going back to the founding and I think then what began to happen in 1960 was a recognition that we should take that tradition and... and turn it into positive law on the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.053" offset="1702105">And so you now had three quarters of the States who no longer regulate this conduct for anyone based on a recognition that it's not consistent with our basic American values about the relationship between the individual and the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="402.222" offset="1754767">Well, it depends on what you mean by our basic American values, to revert to what the Chief Justice was suggesting earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.958" offset="1785696">Really what's at issue in this case is whether we're going to adhere to... in the first part of the case, not the equal protection aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.340" offset="1811296">It's whether we're going to adhere to what... what we said in... in Glucksberg, mainly that before we find a substantive due process right, a fundamental liberty, we have to assure ourselves that that liberty was objectively deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.121" offset="1886320">That's what we said in Glucksberg and we've said it in other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.391" offset="1903456">Or are we going to depart from that and go to the approach that we've adopted with regard to the Eighth Amendment, which is it evolves and changes in... in social values will justify a new perception of what is called unusual punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.693" offset="1980674">Now, why should we... why should we slip into the second mode?</text>
            <text syncTime="464.433" offset="2003662">I'm... I mean, suppose all the States had laws against flagpole sitting at one time, you know, there was a time when it was a popular thing and probably annoyed a lot of communities, and then almost all of them repealed those laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="1347.530" offset="5536044">We're asking you to overrule it and we think that the right of... of the fundamental right of unmarried people to make these choices about private adult consensual intimacy applies to different sex couples as well as same sex couples and that Bowers was wrong for essentially three reasons, first it posed the question too narrowly by focusing just on homosexual sodomy, which is just one of the moral choices that couples ought to have... that people ought to have available to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.390" offset="5631443">And second in its analysis of history, which I think I explained already and third, and perhaps most importantly, in the assumptions that the Court made in 1986 about the realities of gay lives and gay relationships, the Court simply asserted in the Bowers case that there's no showing that has been demonstrated between the opportunity to engage in this conduct and family.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.824" offset="5713154">And certainly while it may not have been shown in that case or even apparent to the Court this 1986, I submit it has to be apparent to the Court now that there are gay families that family relationships are established, that there are hundreds of thousands of people registered in the Census in the 2000 census who have formed gay families, gay partnerships, many of them raising children and that for those people, the opportunity to engage in sexual expression as they will in the privacy of their own homes performs much the same function that it does in the marital context, that you can't protect one without the other, that it doesn't make sense to draw a line there and that you should protect it for everyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.937" offset="5861634">That this is a fundamental matter of American values.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.114" offset="5874382">So those are the three reasons we ask you to overrule Bowers v. Hardwick as to the fundamental rights aspect of the case and that we think that that is an area where the Court should go... should go back and reconsider itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.117" offset="5926314">The Court has now left open for nearly 30 years the question of whether anybody outside has a right... has a privacy right to engage in consensual sexual intimacy in the privacy of their home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.090" offset="5974274">And I submit to you, you know, while the Court has left that unanswered, the American people have moved on to the point where that right is taken for granted for everyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.006" offset="6009905">Most Americans would be shocked to find out that their decision to engage in sexual intimacy with another person in their own home might lead to a knock on the door as occurred here and a criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.530" offset="6052015">And that... that reality is something that the Court needs into account and certainly in so doing, it shouldn't... in constructing its fundamental rights edifice draw distinctions between gay couples and other couples.</text>

            <text syncTime="3145.319" offset="12727136">And by so doing, they excluded a certain class of people from the political debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.263" offset="12750960">Now, on the contrary, Texas welcomes all into the political debate and... in the last Texas legislature, fortunately our legislature meets only every other year, but in the last Texas legislature, there was a hate crime statute passed which made it a more heinous crime to make someone a victim of crime based upon their sexual orientation and it included all sexual orientations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.558" offset="12856077">It included homosexuals, bisexuals and heterosexuals, all, so I don't think we can say across the board that there's some sort of Texas policy that we're trying to overall discriminate against... against homosexuals as a group.</text>

            <text syncTime="3239.042" offset="13102046">And then, again, the State does not allow any disabilities to come from class C misdemeanor acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.487" offset="13135796">I'm sure it's obvious to this Court that the issues of homosexual rights are highly emotional for the petitioner in these quarters but equally anxious in this Court's... for this Court's decision are those who are, number one, concerned with the rights of States to determine their own destiny, and, two, and possibly more important, those persons who are concerned that the invalidation of this little Texas statute would make... would make marriage law subject to constitutional challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.638" offset="13284485">Then again, how far behind that can there be other acts of sexual gratification brought for constitutional challenge also.</text>

            <text syncTime="3314.089" offset="13402245">The State of Texas is asking this Court to be mindful of the far-reaching aspects of your decision in this case, so as not to disenfranchise 23 million Texans who ought to have the right to participate in questions having to do with moral issues.</text>

            <text syncTime="3338.592" offset="13500256">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.988" offset="13509869">I just have a couple of points to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.640" offset="13516452">I thought I might address this question of what it was that we proved in the record below and whether or not we have, as a result, adequately teed up the issues before the Court without having put into evidence directly that this was a noncoercive act or a noncommercial act or a nonpublic act or things of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.679" offset="13588550">Our position is that this is a criminal statute that has only two elements, it has a list of particular kinds of sexual intimacy that you're not allowed to engage in and it they have to prove as well that the two people involved were of the same sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.074" offset="13634212">There was a complaint that was filed that listed those two elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.168" offset="13646542">My clients pleaded no contest to those two elements but said that there is an insufficient basis for imposing criminal liability on them, because, first of all, they invade fundamental rights and second of all, because the law is discriminatory, while it's supposedly got a moral basis, it's a discriminatory morality, a morality imposed only on one category of couples in a State which does not penalize in any way adultery, fornication or sodomy for people of... of couples that are different sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.004" offset="13769945">Those are the arguments that were made and... so our position is that that the statute is unconstitutional both facially and as applied here, because the State purports to impose liability based on those two elements alone and that they are constitutionally insufficient bases both for fundamental rights reasons and because it's a discriminatory state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.263" offset="13854895">The other point I thought I might just address for the moment is the public health rationale which didn't come up before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.465" offset="13875793">Essentially, what the facts are... and I think this comes out to a large extent, it's undisputed in the amicus briefing... the issue is not briefed in here because the Texas brief doesn't even attempt to make this argument, but it is... the facts are that if this was the line between safe and unsafe forms of sexual intimacy it's as if the law cuts right across it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.113" offset="13962310">Regulating some of the most safe forms of sexual activity possible, including, for example, lots of safe sex... same-sex activity involving women and leaving completely unregulated all sorts of forms of unsafe sexual activity involving different sex couples.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.617" offset="14024377">So if there was ever a case of a law where the fit is egregiously improper and insufficient to justify the law under the rational basis test, this would be such a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.929" offset="14069621">Unless the Court has further questions, thank you very much.</text>
