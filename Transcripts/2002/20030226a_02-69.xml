            <text syncTime="16.884" offset="213718">When parties knowingly and voluntarily proceed to trial before a magistrate judge, they consent within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. section 636(c)(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="29.516" offset="264187">The plain language of the statute confers case-dispositive authority on full-time magistrate judges upon the consent of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.804" offset="301385">Congress did not specify in section 636 what form that consent should take.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.575" offset="328448">It did not include adjectives such as express or written, and the omission of such qualifiers is significant.</text>

            <text syncTime="65.553" offset="408383">However, a violation of that rule did not divest the magistrate judge of authority to preside over the case, and that is because the authority emanates from the statute, specifically the requirement that the consent be voluntary in 636(c)(1), and although it was error not to follow the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure or the local rules for the Southern District of Texas, which may have had writing requirements, these rules were related to procedural safeguards to protect the voluntariness of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.990" offset="542130">They are not the consent requirement themselves, and it is the voluntariness of the agreement that gives a magistrate judge authority to preside, not compliance with technicalities of statutory referral procedures.</text>

            <text syncTime="1942.028" offset="7914303">Congress was clearly very concerned that consent be voluntary, willing, and knowing.</text>

            <text syncTime="3183.857" offset="12881643">That is what Congress said consent is for, and that is why Congress said consent cannot be something that simply is implied as you go along.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.659" offset="12912781">Consent must be something you communicate to the clerk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.888" offset="12921767">It must be something clear, and that is why eight courts of appeals, we respectfully submit, have already reached the conclusion there must be express consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.940" offset="12953950">They've reached the conclusion that without it, the court has no jurisdiction, and both... and all of these decisions came before amendments to the Magistrates Act in 1990, in '96.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.804" offset="12993343">If Congress had an issue with both the consent requirement being read as express consent and with courts concluding they had no jurisdiction without it, then Congress could have take action, taken action, and because it didn't, I believe that that is a sign that Congress meant what it said in the Magistrates Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3235.953" offset="13089996">Because the statute was designed to protect the voluntariness of the parties, and the local rules and the Federal rules also serve that purpose, and here you have no party suggesting that they were coerced or involuntarily dragged before a magistrate judge rather than an Article III judge, to reverse in these circumstances, as the Fifth Circuit did, to sua sponte investigate consent when there is no question, where no one is claiming to have been involuntarily dragged before the magistrate judge, would be to import some sort of automatic, per se, plain error, subject matter jurisdictional principle into a context that is not based on subject matter jurisdiction but, rather, the particularity of a particular officer presiding and, as Justice Breyer noted, the de facto officer doctrine exists to insulate judgments from attack that have a technical deficiency, for example, not signing a consent form.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.096" offset="13338577">And because all parties voluntarily proceeded in this fashion, their consent should not have been questioned after the judgment was entered, and there is no basis to find any sort of harm to any of the parties when their Article III rights were not violated in any respect, and for these reasons we would ask that you reverse the judgment of the Fifth Circuit.</text>
