            <text syncTime="12.736" offset="205345">First in Volt and then again last term in Waffle House this Court made clear that, quote, arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act is a matter of consent, not coercion.</text>

            <text syncTime="82.318" offset="483705">But second of all, the... the court went further than that and said what was going to inform its judgment about how to interpret or how to apply this particular situation, it wasn't anything with respect to the language or understanding of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.486" offset="540339">What it was was, without any contractual directive whatsoever, staying it twice, the court simply coerced Green Tree to defend a class arbitration proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="3435.821" offset="13897687">Justice Breyer, with respect to whether or not the arbitrator thought he exercised independent authority, I think it's pretty clear that both parties in this case have taken inconsistent positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.216" offset="13935304">If you read the respondent's briefs below, they say that the arbitrator had no authority to go beyond the class certification of the decision that had already been made by the State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.612" offset="13972816">Whether he did or not I say at the end of the day doesn't matter, because I don't think it's a question for the arbitrator, but if it is, he exceeded his authority, because he clearly doesn't have the authority under this contract to make a decision with respect to the third parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.426" offset="14024120">That takes us to the question Justice Scalia raised, which is, you know, what... what do you do with the fact that the South Carolina Supreme Court has said not word one about arbitrator selected by me?</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.928" offset="14074066">There's nothing that interprets that language of this agreement, and if the Federal Arbitration Act doesn't have at least some component here to say, look, the terms of the contract cannot be categorically ignored or disregarded by the State court, those are rights that are there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.008" offset="14150448">We said as plainly as we could we would not consent to this, and the court rejected it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.818" offset="14169674">And the final point I would make with respect to hostility, while it is true that this Court has consistently struck down efforts to be hostile to arbitration, it has never said that that's the only basis on which preemption will arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.291" offset="14227562">Preemption in this context exists in the same way it does in every other context, does it interfere with the full achievement of Congress' objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.528" offset="14256505">That's Hines v. Davidowitz, and the answer to that here, and it's the same answer that would arise if they were to... if we had an agreement that said class action has, that of course this is manifest hostility to this arbitration agreement as written.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.513" offset="14308437">It's a bilateral agreement, and all the South Carolina Supreme Court had to say about that bilateral agreement is, it would be judicially inefficient for us to have to go through each one of these individually.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.446" offset="14360159">Well, that's all well and good, but that's coercion, that's not consent, and if the Federal Arbitration Act has any meaning, it means that you apply the consent of the parties here, and if you do that, the South Carolina Supreme Court has to be overturned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.806" offset="14417629">Thank you, Your Honors.</text>
