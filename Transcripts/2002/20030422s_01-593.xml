            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="85565">The opinion of the Court in No. 01-593, Dole Food Company against Patrickson and the companion case will be announced by Justice Kennedy.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="12.357" offset="134989">This case requires us to interpret the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, and under that Act foreign states can claim certain immunities and rights when they are sued in the State or a Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.787" offset="180651">A corporation that is an instrumentality of a foreign state can also claim some of those same rights, and the right that is in question here is the right to remove a suit that is filed in State Court to a Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.640" offset="244076">These are two cases and in 01-594, the petitioners are two foreign corporations organized under the lawsuit of State of Israel.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.497" offset="283469">They were sued in State Court of Hawaii and they invoked the Act in order to removed the Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.964" offset="305412">And there are two questions: the first is, Does Israel's relationship to these companies make them instrumentalities of a foreign state so that they can come within in this act?</text>
            <text syncTime="65.727" offset="348461">The statute says a corporation is an instrumentality of a majority of its shares or other ownership interests as owned by the foreign state.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.645" offset="380122">The problem for these petitioners is that Israel did not own their shares directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.069" offset="401751">Instead, Israel, at the relevant time, owned the majority of shares in the corporation that was removed from these corporations by several tiers of ownerships. They were subsidiaries several years then.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.043" offset="457653">So they were subsidiaries of a corporation that was owned by Israel and we hold that this indirect ownership does not suffice to bring the companies under the Act, and the petitioners say, well, since you can trace down the corporate latter, and show that each parent own the majority of the subsidiary immediately beneath then in effect and certainly in common parlance these companies were owned by Israel.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.562" offset="559740">In matters of corporate law, the structure is of great importance, and as a general rule, a corporate parent that owns shares of this subsidiary does not own the subsidiaries assets, and if those assets happen to be shares in some other corporation, the parent does not own them either.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.137" offset="630061">The same rule applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.057" offset="637689">These petitioners could not claim to be instrumentalities of Israel for a second alternative reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.668" offset="664229">That is because even if they are indirect ownership theory had been correct, Israel had divested itself of its ownership in the corporate parent by the time the suit was filed, and we hold that at the time of filing suite, not the time of the alleged wrong that is controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.605" offset="731939">This is the same rule we follow in other cases where jurisdiction is being tested, for instance, in the diversity cases as the time of suit has filed that is controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.013" offset="773526">So it follows that under the relevant provision of the Act which is 28 U.S.C. Sections 1603(b), the petiioners cannot claim instrumentalities status under the Act and they cannot invoke its protections and they cannot invoke the right to remove.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.610" offset="839981">In No. 01-594, then the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.238" offset="862447">The portion of the opinion for the Court referring to the time for assertaining ownerships status is unanimous.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.073" offset="885852">As to the portion of the opinion discussing direct ownership, Justice Breyer has filed a dissenting opinion which is joined by Justice O'Conner.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.612" offset="919916">In No. 01-593, the petitioners relied on a different theory for removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.005" offset="957532">That theory involves an issue which is not the subject of our writ of certiorari, so that case is dismissed by order of the unanimous Court.</text>
