            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="85227">The second case I have to announce is Moseley against Victoria's Secret Catalogue, No. 01-1015.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.669" offset="123888">In 1995, Congress amended Cection 43 of the Trademark Act of 1946 to provide a remedy for the dilution of famous marks.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.436" offset="166938">That amendment known as the Federal Trademark Dilution Act describes the factors that determine whether a mark is distinctive and famous and defines the term "dilution" as the lessening of the capacity of a famous mark to identify and distinguish goods or services.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.721" offset="240081">The question we granted certiorari to decide is whether objective proof of actual injury to the economic value of a famous mark as opposed to a presumption of harm arising from a subjective likelihood of dilution standard is a requisite for relief under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.365" offset="318657">Petitioners, Victor and Cathy Moseley own an operate a retail store named Victor's Little Secret in a strip mall in Elizabethtown, Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.992" offset="361185">They sell a variety of products including women's lingerie and adult novelties.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.723" offset="384068">Respondents are affiliated corporations that own the Victoria's Secret trademark and operate over 750 Victoria's Secret stores, two of which are in Louisville, Kentucky, a short drive from Elizabethtown.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.626" offset="439656">In 1998, they spent over $55 million advertising lingerie bearing the Victoria's Secret trademark.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.565" offset="471421">They brought this action alleging the petitioner's use of the name Victor's Little Secret in a store-handling tawdry merchandise was likely to blur and erode the distinctiveness and tarnish the reputation of the Victoria's Secret trademark.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.614" offset="539653">The District Court found that there was no likelihood of confusion between the marks but held that the two marks were sufficiently similar to cause dilution and enjoined petitioner from using the name Victor's Little Secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.543" offset="591376">The Court of Appeals affirmed, expressly disagreeing with a case decided by the Fourth Circuit involving Barnum &amp; Bailey's claim that the use by the state of Utah of the phrase, the "greatest snow on earth" on its license plates diluted the value of the phrase "the greatest show on earth."</text>
            <text syncTime="147.376" offset="674654">The Fourth Circuit had held that the statute requires proof that the junior mark not only gave rise to a mental association with the senior mark but also cause some actual harm to the famous mark's economic value.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.071" offset="733482">We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.598" offset="747588">Our examination of the text of the statute convinces us that it does require proof of actual dilution rather than just a likelihood of dilution.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.197" offset="785936">In the language of the Act, there must be evidence of a "lessening of the capacity of the mark to identify and distinguish goods or services."</text>
            <text syncTime="184.315" offset="822403">That does not mean that the plaintiff must prove an actual loss of profits or sales, but as the facts of the Utah case demonstrate, the mere fact that consumers mentally associate one mark with another does not necesarrily prove that there has been any reduction in the capacity of a famous mark to identify the goods of its owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.566" offset="911428">There being no evidence in the record of this case of actual harm to Victoria's Secret mark.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.378" offset="934729">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.089" offset="957508">Justice Kennedy has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
