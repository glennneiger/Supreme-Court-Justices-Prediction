            <text syncTime="133.062" offset="683066">--Yes, Justice Ginsburg, because the information that's precluded from being distributed is the names of the individuals who are being investigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.942" offset="714621">Now, I know that the allegation is made that in the letter that was sent by the district attorney and by the Department of Health and Human Services stated that this was a welfare fraud investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.418" offset="756522">However, that letter actually did not so state.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.387" offset="768434">It stated that the investigation was a confidential investigation that required the payroll information being sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.204" offset="795706">The fundamental right and responsibility of government is to protect its citizens, and one of the main ways it does that, of course, is through the investigation and prosecution of crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.086" offset="859235">The Federal Government and the State government have together an integrated law enforcement regime that allows for search warrants and subpoenas to be executed and issued in connection with the investigation of these crimes or alleged crimes whether the criminal conduct occurs on the reservation or off the reservation and regardless of whether the evidence or proceeds of crime is thought to be on the reservation or off the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.112" offset="983265">For instance, in a Public Law 280 State, such as California, if there is a crime committed off the reservation, frankly as well as on the reservation, the Federal Government does not have jurisdiction over that crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.475" offset="1044705">Thus, the Federal Government does not have the ability to issue a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.698" offset="1061632">If the States do not have the ability to issue a search warrant under those circumstances and there is evidence of crime or proceeds of crime on the reservation, then that property or evidence remains immune from law enforcement.</text>

            <label>Mr. John D. Kirby</label>
            <text syncTime="243.549" offset="1125057">Yes, Justice Kennedy, California is a Public Law 280 State.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.669" offset="1137492">Now, in a non-Public Law 280 State, the same situation presents itself because in that situation, the Federal Government has the right to... and the... the duty, if you will... as a responsibility to its citizens to enforce the criminal law with regard to crimes that occur on the reservation that would be State crimes if they occurred off the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.114" offset="1231323">And under the Major Crimes Act, as well as the General Crimes Act, the Federal Government prosecutes that crime and, of course, does the investigation prior to prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.912" offset="1266537">In order to conduct those activities and to fulfill that mission, if you will, the Federal Government needs to have the right and does have the right to execute search warrants and to issue subpoenas.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.991" offset="1318781">Now, as we have seen, there may be a situation where a crime is committed on the reservation in a Public Law 280 State and a crime committed in a... the same crime in a non-Public Law 280 State, and in those situations, there must be parity with regard to the law enforcement regime.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.299" offset="1395999">If not, what we end up with is gaps in the criminal justice system, and that wasn't the intent of the legislature in enacting Public Law 280.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.129" offset="1431317">As the Court will recall, Public Law 280 was passed by Congress because of a perceived lawlessness on certain reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.606" offset="1469247">That lawlessness arose because Congress felt that the Federal Government... due to the vast distances, if you will, of Federal Government law enforcement agencies, and the lack of density of those agencies... simply wasn't able to enforce criminal laws throughout the vast acreage of reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.825" offset="1550122">And so--</text>

            <text syncTime="435.672" offset="1893580">And the solution that we believe would address that distinction would be a solution that Justice White presented in the Brendale decision when he talked about a tribe having a unique protectable interest in certain situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.086" offset="1955229">And the tribe ought to have a right to go to court... in this case, it would be a State court... to present that protectable interest so that a... an interest-balancing assessment can be accomplished.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.849" offset="1998279">In this case the interest of the tribal record may very well outweigh a minimal interest of the State if it was a simple minor misdemeanor.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.176" offset="2031506">On the other hand, it may be that if it's a large serious felony of multiple murder and there is very direct evidence in the records of the tribal government, perhaps under those facts the court may find that the interest weighed in favor of the State's police power.</text>

            <text syncTime="1895.021" offset="7730902">There are three principles of Federal law that bar this search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.329" offset="7752114">The first is tribal sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.404" offset="7760473">The second is the longstanding principle that States may not infringe the right of tribes to govern themselves or internal affairs on their reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.402" offset="7796417">And the third is that there's no act of Congress that authorizes this search warrant, though two statutes, Public Law 280 and the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, do provide a framework for some assumption of State jurisdiction over tribes and Indians on reservation... the... reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.055" offset="7871023">The county doesn't claim that either applies here to authorize this act, and they do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.134" offset="7891399">I... I want to address, if I may, Justice Scalia's question about the commercial and governmental distinction because basically the Indian Gaming Act by Congress sets up a framework for tribes to operate gaming.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.524" offset="7960989">This is a tribal enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.934" offset="7970602">It has to be, under the Gaming Act, owned and controlled by the tribe.</text>

            <text syncTime="2193.446" offset="8924594">First, the Finnish government, if it wanted to could decide to invest the proceeds of the shipping line in the U.S. stock market.</text>

            <text syncTime="2218.398" offset="9024486">The second distinction really was I think pointed out in... in Justice Souter's question to... I forget whether it was to Mr. Kirby or Ms. McDowell.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.926" offset="9054579">But... but Congress has enacted the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act which provides that a commercial enterprise of a foreign nation operating in the United States is stripped of its sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.657" offset="9097524">Congress has never done that for a tribe, and it's very important to note that while sovereign immunity in the tribal context is a common law doctrine developed by this Court, it has been adopted by Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="3294.804" offset="13330092">Well, I certainly think in footnote 27 of our brief, we cited a number of Indian cases, the Chickasaw case, the Sac and Fox case, New Mexico Apache Tribe v. Mescalero, where the Court had entertained similar claims under 1331.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.664" offset="13397488">We're only seeking here prospective injunctive and declaratory relief against the county, and we only brought the action when they threatened the second search and seizure.</text>

            <text syncTime="3353.241" offset="13563836">I would like to address very briefly the flip side, if you will, of the categorical rule being proposed by the tribe and the problems with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.079" offset="13607199">And that flip side involves not the police power of the State, which we have already talked about, but the constitutional rights of a defendant who is faced with criminal prosecution in a State court when that defendant feels there is exculpatory evidence in the possession of the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.081" offset="13671147">For instance, it may be a video surveillance of the parking lot or whatnot that shows perhaps a self-defense defense for this particular person.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.192" offset="13703643">Under the tribe's rule--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="3389.750" offset="13709808">It's odd for you to be raising a tribal member as a defendant when you have potential tribal members here who might be subject to suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.513" offset="13752858">You seem a strange champion for such people.</text>

            <label>Mr. John D. Kirby</label>
            <text syncTime="3403.970" offset="13766755">--It doesn't necessarily need to be a tribal member who might be a criminal defendant, Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.174" offset="13787549">It could be anyone, a non-tribal member or even a patron, who feels that there is exculpatory evidence that the tribe possesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.038" offset="13819000">And under the Sixth Amendment, that person has the right to have the State issue compulsory process to obtain that exculpatory evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.830" offset="13850138">Under the tribe's rule that's being proposed, the tribe would have the ability to trump the Sixth Amendment right of the accused in that situation and not produce the exculpatory evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.678" offset="13889531">The tribe would also have the right to trump the Fourteenth Amendment rights to a fair trial of that particular person.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.994" offset="13910847">And that's the flip side of the categorical rule that's being proposed and why we believe it's another reason it should not be adopted by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.104" offset="13947314">With regard to the 1983 action, I would like to say that not only is the tribe not a person within the meaning of the statute and the interpretive presumption that this Court has set forth in, I believe, the Vermont Agency it was acknowledged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.973" offset="14010739">But also the right that the tribe is asserting, the right to self-governance, is not a Federal statutory right and it's not a constitutional right, and as such, it cannot support a 1983 action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.405" offset="14060476">And that is another reason why 1983 provides no relief for the tribe in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.889" offset="14082419">In... in closing, I would like to say that this case does not implicate traditional sovereign immunity which is sovereign immunity from civil suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.387" offset="14128395">And there was a question raised with regard to that, I believe by Justice Scalia, pointing out that the tribe's treasury is not at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.189" offset="14155562">It's not at stake here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.322" offset="14160159">What we're dealing with is process, in this case the criminal process of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.023" offset="14178968">And that's a totally different situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.237" offset="14187745">This Court has never addressed criminal process as being subject to tribal immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.737" offset="14205821">All of this Court's decisions have addressed the tribe's immunity to civil lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.191" offset="14227660">That is not what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.938" offset="14234556">The doctrine of tribal immunity should not be extended in this case to include criminal process for the reasons that we have set forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.499" offset="14264858">While there may not be any wholly satisfactory result, Justice Breyer, we believe that our position is the best position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.489" offset="14300803">Even if one has to choose between either of the two categorical approaches, simply even looking at the rights of an accused and compulsory process, that should mitigate toward the county's position here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.963" offset="14346674">We've also suggested a procedure, as presented by Justice White in Brendale, as being a potential resolution of this problem, maintaining the dignity of the tribe and also allowing the State to exercise its police power and protect its citizens as it investigates and prosecutes crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.899" offset="14414488">If there are no further questions--</text>
