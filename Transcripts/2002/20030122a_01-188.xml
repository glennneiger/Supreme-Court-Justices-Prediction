            <text syncTime="430.133" offset="1872022">But what... what... what Maine is doing is using Medicaid recipients to further completely unrelated purposes of the State, then it seems to me what you've done is essentially ask the Federal Government to subsidize a program that... that's not an appropriate one to subsidize.</text>

            <text syncTime="3571.854" offset="14438905">Justice Stevens, I want to focus on the narrowest basis on which this case can be decided, which is, we have a preliminary injunction that was issued by the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.556" offset="14473700">A preliminary injunction was issued on the basis of two bases, 1) the State has not put forward any Medicaid-related purpose to be served by Maine Rx, and 2) that no matter how you want to define it, there is an obstacle to the full achievement of the recipient's primary interest of receiving medicine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.992" offset="14547366">As I said, there's a clear debate as to exactly the extent of the obstacle, but that there could be no question that there is an obstacle, and it seems to me that what this Court can do is simply say, those two findings are not an abuse of discretion on the record in this particular case, therefore there is a basis for affirming.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.476" offset="14613299">If the Court wants to go further from that and say, on remand, some guidance might be useful from the Secretary of HHS and propose some mechanism by which to have primary jurisdiction or some other mechanism devised by which to obtain the review by the Secretary, I think there's probably no problem with that and, as I said before, I can't imagine that we would have any complaint about that, but the importance of this is to... is to retain the injunction in place so that the unquestioned harms that are going to happen are not allowed to take place, and then try to undo them after the fact, which was the reason for issuing the injunction.</text>
