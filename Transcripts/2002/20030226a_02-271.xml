            <label>Mr. Seth P. Waxman</label>
            <text syncTime="74.940" offset="437623">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="78.475" offset="451833">We rely on four propositions in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.097" offset="470328">First, there is a long final judgment in the Agent Orange litigation that binds a class which by its terms includes respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.620" offset="512333">Second, all of the judges in the direct proceedings, the trial judges and the appellate judges, concluded that all veterans should be included in the class and settlement, because all of the veterans, whether they were symptomatic or not, face the overwhelming prospect of legal defeat on issues common to the entire class, first and foremost, the Government contractor defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.786" offset="621002">Third, adequacy of representation was expressly considered several times, both generally and with specific respect to asymptomatic veterans, by both the district court and the court of appeals, and fourth, there is simply no question that Judge Weinstein, whose scholarship on class actions the 1966 Rule 23 Advisory Committee repeatedly cited, and who literally wrote the book on mass tort litigation, conscientiously applied the procedures of Rule 23, including, in particular, the obligation that he certify and thereafter ensure adequacy of representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.946" offset="813682">Now, the respondents may certainly challenge the res judicata effect of the judgment against them, and the question presented for this Court is the permissible scope and standard of that review.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.040" offset="870106">In our view, due process does not require and finality principles do not permit de novo relitigation from scratch of the adequacy determination made in this case.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="197.731" offset="928829">What about notice, notice to these respondents?</text>
            <text syncTime="203.981" offset="953802">It's sort of hard to find, looking back at the settlement agreement and the orders that were entered, that the people in respondent's category were thought to be covered.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="seth_p_waxman" startTime="220.404" stopTime="315.072">
            <label>Mr. Seth P. Waxman</label>
            <text syncTime="220.404" offset="1019526">Well, Justice O'Connor, notice in this case... I think as the case comes to this Court, the Court certainly cannot decide this case on the principle that the notice was constitutionally inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.673" offset="1076578">In the first place, both the trial court and the court of appeals three times found the notice adequate under Rule 23 and under the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.643" offset="1120464">The Second Circuit below suggested that this Court's decision in Amchem might have made the notice defective, but notice issues were not presented by the respondents in this case as an alternative grounds for affirmance in their brief in opposition, and what is more, their factual record in this case is completely inadequate to conclude that the notice was unsatisfactory with respect to the content.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.652" offset="1228506">I completely understand the argument that they're making with respect to how the words, injured by exposure, would have been read at the time, but one cannot answer that question either in a vacuum, without looking at the external circumstances, or in hindsight.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.057" offset="1302171">One has to determine whether, in 1984, an asymptomatic veteran, a healthy veteran, would, whether all of them, many of them, most of them, some of them, or some significant number would have understood that that includes me because exposure itself has been said to be injurious.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.391" offset="1391510">Now, at footnote 12--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="315.072" offset="1398197">Mr. Waxman, I'd like to stop you right there, exposure itself has been said to be injurious.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.807" offset="1413139">This Court in Metro North said, exposure only people have no claim, and it did so purporting to use traditional common law in interpreting the FELA, so according to this Court's decision in Metro North, isn't it clear that these people had no ripe claim to state, and how could they be adequately represented when their claim had not yet accrued?</text>
            <text syncTime="356.090" offset="1562246">As I understand the law of both Louisiana and New Jersey, where these cases come from, the claim doesn't accrue until the exposure has manifested itself in an injury, in an illness.</text>

            <text syncTime="371.781" offset="1625045">--Justice Ginsburg, before I answer that, let me just give one more answer to Justice O'Connor, and I'll directly address your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.262" offset="1670916">The only other point I wanted to make... I'm afraid I'll forget it... is that in footnote 12 of our reply brief we point out that at the time, that is, at the time of certification and before settlement, publications ranging from The New York Times to Penthouse Magazine, which we put at the end of our footnote, and newspapers, local newspapers in the states that these two respondents reside in, understood that the class included all veterans in Vietnam who were... were or may have been exposed, and that's the factual issue that, without which you can't resolve the notice issue in this case adverse to us.</text>

            <text syncTime="430.778" offset="1860983">I mean, you could have, if you really thought this was the class, given mail notice to all the veterans, all the people who had served in Vietnam, and newspaper service is very nice, but it's rarely seen by anyone, but anyway, let's get back to--</text>

            <text syncTime="458.118" offset="1970384">They may never have a claim, but they certainly have no ripe claim at this stage.</text>

            <text syncTime="484.156" offset="2074560">Now, at the time, in 19... I mean, our submission essentially is, here the adequacy determination and the Article III claims sort of mesh together, but our... our submission here is that injury in fact, which is what is necessary in order to include them in the class, is not dependent on the existence of a mature cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.246" offset="2170899">They clearly alleged that they were injured in fact because, as New York State and other states recognized at the time, there was a mature tort for exposure, injury by exposure, and many, many states recognized that and applied that rule at the time, and in any event, whether or not they had a mature cause of action, they plainly had a present right at the time and a cognizable interest in the establishment of a... of a fund that would be available to compensate them.</text>

            <text syncTime="558.492" offset="2371833">Your... your friend on the other side has said, the first time that in writing we saw anything that made it plain, even though it was buried in language somewhere, that the injured class included the exposures only was in the notice of settlement, and so my question is, is that correct, and number 2, aside from that point, why would, why should we understand that the parties involved, including the representative plaintiffs, understood that injured included exposures only, so that they knew they were supposed to be representing them?</text>
