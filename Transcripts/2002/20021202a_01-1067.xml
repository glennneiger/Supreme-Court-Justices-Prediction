            <text syncTime="124.769" offset="654288">It's also true that the tribe itself has engaged in historic restoration efforts at the fort with the support of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Department of the Interior, and with the assistance of private, State, and even... in some cases...

            <text syncTime="156.226" offset="780094">--Well, when Congress places land in trust for Indians, it has two well-settled meanings that this Court has recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.028" offset="811336">First, it places a restraint on the alienation of property, and second, it immunizes the property from State taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.035" offset="843310">And if you look at pages 6 and 7 of the respondent's lodging, that indicates that in 1958, when there was discussion about what to do with Fort Apache, the tribe itself encouraged the Department to have Congress place the land in trust so that it was in a nontaxable status like the surrounding reservation lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.663" offset="913841">Now, we know from the first Mitchell decision decided by this Court that simply placing property in trust does not in itself create a substantive right to money damages.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="198.663" offset="949890">But there was an enormous difference in that case in that the Indians managed the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.805" offset="978416">Under the General Allotments Act, the idea was to make the individual owner autonomous.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.371" offset="1004643">Here, I think it's not disputed that this land has been operated by the U.S. Government, and the U.S. Government has exclusive control.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gregory G. Garre</label>
            <text syncTime="222.606" offset="1045603">Justice Ginsburg, that... that may be true in the factual sense, but the 1960 act... that is, that the Federal Government is using the property, but the 1960 act... quite unlike the General Allotment Act... specifically reserves to the Government the right to use the property for Government uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.037" offset="1111327">And in that respect, we think the trust relationship created by the statute in this case is much more limited than the one that was created by the statute in Mitchell I, and the existence of factual Federal control cannot in itself give rise to a damages action under the Tucker Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="265.536" offset="1217384">Well, I... I think generally, the "administrative use" can refer to executive uses, and is a very broad term.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.481" offset="1241103">In that respect, I think it's instructive that Congress used that term.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.331" offset="1252492">Nevertheless, I think that... that "administrative purposes" has to be read with school purposes, and can be read to refer to both uses for storage and the like, and also for administrative purposes used by the Bureau of Indian Affairs to undertake activities at Fort Apache or... or on the surrounding reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.052" offset="1335353">So in that respect, it's administrative for the purpose of the Department of the Interior, who operates activities there through the local agent of the Bureau of Indian Affairs.</text>

            <text syncTime="327.254" offset="1464189">The... the vast majority of the property has been within the Government's control, but it's important to recognize that the court of appeals' decision remands for building-by-building, in a sense, trial on the existence of Federal use and control.</text>

            <text syncTime="3429.210" offset="13872038">If they kept using for 100 years, then of course, there's going to be normal... you know, even normal wear and tear, but there's still... that's something for the trial court to sort out as to the measure of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.508" offset="13921253">I mean, what is reasonable... what is reasonable to repair, what is reasonable not to under the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.504" offset="13941211">That's... that's a question for the trier of fact as to the measure of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.334" offset="13960541">But, you know, the reality of the situation is that the need has expired except for about 10 buildings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.010" offset="13999203">In this... I mentioned the Bostwick case because in the Bostwick case, the United States had open, free use... unrestricted use of a private home, and they... they committed waste.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.025" offset="14075271">And there was... and this Court... Court... they were sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.469" offset="14089064">The United States was sued and the Court said that there's an implied covenant against waste even those the lease is silent as to that duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.389" offset="14116754">And I think the analogy is here in the trust situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.899" offset="14130755">When... when... it doesn't matter if the statute doesn't say you have to repair buildings when you're using them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.132" offset="14155728">It would be unnatural for a statute to say so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.378" offset="14164714">That's all I have, Your Honor.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gregory G. Garre</label>
            <text syncTime="3514.166" offset="14211839">Thank you, Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.190" offset="14219989">May it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.138" offset="14223751">The Government is not using the property, and is not required to use the property for the benefit of the tribe as the court of appeals acknowledged at page 14a of the appendix to the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.335" offset="14264502">It's using the property for its own Government purposes, and in that respect, this case is completely unlike Mitchell II, where the statutes and regulations specifically required the Government to manage the property as an economic resource for the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.166" offset="14319882">There are no trust assets to pay for any historic restoration efforts because Congress directed that the property would be used for Government purposes, not for any... any kind of economic purposes that would generate assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.713" offset="14370037">Congress has a separate regime for historic preservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.935" offset="14382889">It grants millions of dollars each year for historic preservation projects, and as Mr. Brauchli alluded, Congress has granted funds for historic reservation at Fort Apache.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.473" offset="14421132">The tribe has engaged in its own historic preservation efforts there with millions of dollars of private, State, and Federal funding, and the Department of the Interior has put millions of dollars of its own maintenance and repair efforts into the fort.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.823" offset="14466481">Thank you very much.</text>
