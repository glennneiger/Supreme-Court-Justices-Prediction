            <text syncTime="3162.978" offset="12803924">I don't... I don't see it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.136" offset="12808627">I see that the question about if you need... if an individual has to prove that the Government's argument is frivolous, that's not the same thing as showing that you have a non-frivolous claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.999" offset="12851990">And that's all that we're saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.664" offset="12858677">I think that they're completely different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.561" offset="12866305">One is showing that the Government's argument is frivolous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.284" offset="12877172">I don't... most of the cases where individuals were found not deportable, it wasn't that the Government's claim was frivolous, but those individuals prevailed in their proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.360" offset="12921475">And that's the issue here, whether... whether an individual can be detained for a substantial period of time without any opportunity to show that... that there's no purpose that's served by their detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.390" offset="12969645">And I think that... that this case is a perfect example because in this case, once the district court... our client was detained for 6 months without any individualized determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.532" offset="13006217">The district court then said due process requires an individualized determination, and the INS, the Immigration Service, on its own decided he poses no danger and he can be released on 5,000-dollar bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.102" offset="13056476">And he's been out for the past 3-and-a-half years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.483" offset="13065985">He's now getting his college degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.230" offset="13072986">He's working.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.799" offset="13075284">If the Government prevails in this appeal, it will have no choice but to re-incarcerate him throughout his proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.615" offset="13106527">It's not a question of discretion like Carlson, where they can make that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.424" offset="13121782">And going back to your question about burden, I think it's important to recognize that the regime that was in place prior to this statute, and that is now in place in those circuits where they've said that the statute needs to be interpreted to... or that the statute... due process requires an individualized determination, still requires that an individual show that they are not a danger of flight risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.104" offset="13216450">They bear that burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.118" offset="13220525">And so under this system, no individual who's a danger of flight risk is going to be released except for those cases where there's, you know, obviously going to be error.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.088" offset="13256365">But in general, individuals who are a danger of flight risk aren't going to be released.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.347" offset="13273397">I think it... there's one last point that I would like to make because I realize my time is short, which is that this case poses a serious constitutional problem, and we believe that there is a way that this Court can avoid that problem by construing the statute to not apply to individuals like our client who are, in fact, not deportable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.132" offset="13348525">The statute says that individuals shall be mandatorily detained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.228" offset="13364930">An individual who is deportable on one of these grounds is subject to mandatory detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.560" offset="13386246">As we've been talking about here, in fact, the question of whether he is deportable remains very much to be decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.027" offset="13416130">He doesn't have any order of deportation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3376.241" offset="13656979">One is when... is deportable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.083" offset="13668369">It says, when released.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.514" offset="13674115">Our point is only that there are individuals who have deportation proceedings while they're in prison, and there will be an immigration judge decision or a BIA decision that says they are deportable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.826" offset="13723330">Now, they may still be seeking review of that decision in the Federal courts, in which case, that decision is not final and they would not fit under the next statute, the statute that you... that this Court construed in... in Zadvydas, which was 1241, but they would... or excuse me... 1231.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.966" offset="13795951">But they would still have an order of deportation, and then, that would be a way to say that individual is deportable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.735" offset="13830955">Whereas, here you have a situation where anybody who the Government charges with being deportable... in this case, our client, even though he may not actually be deportable... is subject to mandatory detention for possibly a year, 2 years, however long.</text>

            <text syncTime="3491.933" offset="14119764">Let me just deal with a few things that were raised during my colleague's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.831" offset="14143379">First of all, the date of the offense that's involved in this case was after the enactment of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.676" offset="14162710">On page 8 of the respondent's brief, it is asserted that he was convicted of petty theft with priors and sentenced to 3 years' imprisonment in 1997.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.636" offset="14202625">That was when that conviction took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.499" offset="14214014">Secondly... and I think a lot of time has been expended with respect to the question that focused in large part by Justice Breyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.297" offset="14241182">What happens if it's not the individual?</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.596" offset="14250377">What happens if he's really a citizen?</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.472" offset="14257900">What happens if he wants to challenge whether this crime was one that should be covered?</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.459" offset="14277858">As we said on page 26... and we cite the relevant provision of the INS regulations... those types of things can be challenged in an individualized bond hearing at which the... which is what the Ninth Circuit was talking about and which is what our opponents are talking about here, and that those issues may be raised at that point, which is precisely what the respondents are talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.584" offset="14374406">So that's already built into the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.608" offset="14382452">Now, one might quarrel with whether... what the burden of proof is, and where it should be and how it should be written, but that's a... this is a determination by the executive branch with respect to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.602" offset="14422471">If the alien can show that the INS is substantially unlikely to prevail on its underlying charge of removability, then the individual may be released on bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.591" offset="14466357">If the decision goes against the individual, that can be taken to the Board of Immigration Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.145" offset="14484643">So there's a process that takes care of precisely those... that category 2, as you put it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.732" offset="14507004">Now, that does not deal with the question of dangerousness or risk of flight, but that's what Congress was concerned about when it... when it enacted the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.615" offset="14542530">Congress was concerned about a situation in which large numbers of individuals who commit serious crimes... and Congress went to the effort of define what it thought... defining what it thought was serious crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.172" offset="14592685">Now, if there is some question about that in an individual case, or if there's some question about an aberrational lengthy detention, that should be brought to this Court or the courts below in an as-applied challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.181" offset="14644721">The respondent is saying here today that this is an as-applied challenge, but that has never been the way this case has been litigated from the petition, which I cited as a facial challenge, through the district court's decision to the... to the as... the... the facial challenge in part of the decision of the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.347" offset="14717446">This has been a challenge to the congressional determination that people who commit serious crimes are to... to be deportable as rapidly as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.954" offset="14755898">They... and... and to the... in order for that policy to be effectuated, for our borders to be protected, to avoid the acculturation of a criminal alien class in the United States that's operating freely, for a limited period of time, that individual will be detained during that process until the final order of deportation is entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3673.449" offset="14845864">85 percent of the aliens that are brought into these procedures don't even challenge the immigration decision... immigration judge decision, and more than half of those cases are resolved within 30 days.</text>
