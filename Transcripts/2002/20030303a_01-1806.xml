            <text syncTime="1050.133" offset="4349035">Indeed, while striking down broad prophylactic laws, every time this Court has addressed the issue of charitable solicitation, it has reaffirmed the constitutional viability of individual fraud actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.720" offset="4399399">Now, part of the reason that this Court has distinguished between individual fraud actions and broad prophylactic rules is that an individual fraud action can bring into bear the entire context of a misrepresentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.959" offset="4456346">The difficulty with a statute like that before the Court in Riley was that it necessarily focused on a single factor, fundraising costs, and didn't take into account what was told to individual donors or anything else, and then categorically--</text>

            <text syncTime="1462.876" offset="5999974">I mean, if a start-up charity avoids fraudulent statements, then that's going to have a reasonable effect on the mind of the donor, and the donor's going to recognize that, okay, a) start-up charities may have higher cost, but more importantly, the representation that I received was not that you were going to provide food baskets in DuPage County, but that you hoped to provide special services that weren't being provided currently by any extant charity, and I think that context can make all the difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.442" offset="6106240">And there are many elements of common law fraud actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.186" offset="6117211">You have to show knowledge of falsity, intent to deceive, materiality, and reasonable reliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.420" offset="6142184">In Illinois, as is typical, you have to show those factors by clear and convincing evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.660" offset="6163082">All of that is going to provide substantial breathing room for First Amendment values.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.690" offset="6183249">Indeed, much of this Court's jurisprudence in the libel and deformation area has been a process of taking the requirements of the common law for fraud, which were much more onerous, and superimposing them on the law of libel and defamation, where things like falsity was presumed, and damages could be presumed, upon a showing of defamation, and I think if you put it in that context, that all of the safeguards that this Court has carefully constructed over the years in the libel and defamation context are in place to protect the... the First Amendment rights and provide breathing room, then I think that the idea that the sky is falling is really mistaken in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.117" offset="6332983">And I think to the contrary, if this Court were to suggest in a case where the reality is that not just 85 percent is going to the professional fundraiser, but fully 97 percent is going to something other than program services, because VietNow only spends 20 percent of the money they receive on program services, if this were... Court were to suggest in this case that there's not a fraud action, then it really will be open season for charitable solicitation fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.224" offset="6437368">And I think this Court has been particularly concerned about broad prophylactic rules in the First Amendment area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.714" offset="6463386">This is reflected in... in, most critically in its prior restraint doctrine, and that... that instinct is reflected in Schaumburg, Munson, and Riley, but at the same time, there's a corollary principle, which specific instances of fraud can be prosecuted by the Government, and that instinct is also reflected in Munson, Schaumburg, and Riley, and there's simply nothing in the First Amendment that suggests that charitable solicitation fraud need go unpunished, and with respect, I think what the Illinois Supreme Court did here in creating a broad prophylactic immunity for charitable solicitation from the law of fraud is just as unjustified as the broad prophylactic rules limiting charitable solicitation that this Court struck down in Schaumburg, Munson, and Riley.</text>

            <text syncTime="3261.613" offset="13194932">I'd like to first correct two clarifications in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.240" offset="13213427">In fact, the Illinois Supreme Court never said that the affidavit should not properly be treated as part of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.677" offset="13231190">They refer to the affidavits, but our allegations stand on their own without the need for those affidavits, which would simply be an elaboration of the types of misrepresentations made to donors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.379" offset="13270060">A second, the web site that the Illinois Attorney General keeps does not hold up 90 percent kept by fundraisers as the ordinary and usual thing that's regularly practiced in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.380" offset="13314050">They indicate that as another one of several egregious examples that people should be warned against, but that is not the only weapon they should have in their arsenal against actual fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.597" offset="13346860">This case is not a claim based upon a mere nondisclosure of a high fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.425" offset="13366191">It is a claim based upon a particular instance of actual deception based upon statements made to donors that constitute misrepresentations under the common law of fraud, not explicit misstatements as the Illinois Supreme Court said, or affirmative misstatements, not explicit lies, but misrepresentations in the form of half-truths, and we ask this Court not to hold that half-truths are constitutionally protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.392" offset="13454067">I think the Court said as much in Milkovich and the Masson cases, and no different rule is warranted here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.521" offset="13474547">There is that semantic distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.917" offset="13484160">Let me point out, however, that the key allegation in this complaint, in the body of the text at joint appendix page 9, paragraph 34, says that the effect of representations that were made was that people were told that a significant amount of each dollar donated would be paid over to VietNow, and the defendants knew that was false because 15 cents or less of each dollar would be given to VietNow for its purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.747" offset="13571513">The allegation is that people were told that their money was going to be paid to VietNow and used to buy food baskets, to provide job training for veterans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.453" offset="13598263">That is an actual representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.004" offset="13608503">Whether it constitutes a misrepresentation turns upon whether it reasonably led people to believe something that was false, and we ask the Court to continue to uphold those principles in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.796" offset="13651657">There is no plausible claim that in this case what these defendants are alleged to have done is beyond the State's power to prohibit by a properly drafted law, that these circumstances are egregious, and there is also no possible claim that... that any law invoked here cannot be applied against anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.067" offset="13732741">The fallback position of the defendants in this case is that the Court should take the draconian step of saying that unless there is an explicit misrepresentation of fact, not an implied one, that there should be blanket immunity for charitable fundraisers to lead people to believe that their money is going to be used for specific purposes and have no liability if that is 1 percent true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.396" offset="13810063">That is not something that's justified by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.858" offset="13823961">They have conjured up dire scenarios about all sorts of charities disappearing from the landscape simply by the type of examples that they have given for a chilling effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.822" offset="13863771">There is nothing in the record to show that, and there is nothing in common experience to show that, but what they're asking the Court is to say no, it's not enough for as-applied claims of that variety to be brought in other cases, but that there should be no prosecution ever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.720" offset="13915389">The State is categorically prohibited from bringing a fraud claim in such circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.451" offset="13934302">That is not a value that the First Amendment supports.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.155" offset="13945064">The First Amendment value that's most important here is the donor's right to be able to make informed decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.844" offset="13967843">I see the light's on.</text>
