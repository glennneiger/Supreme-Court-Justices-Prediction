            <text syncTime="306.931" offset="1374787">If you're looking at the text, then just a few lines above, in the text, where it talks about findings, it says that, due to the nature of the roles of men and women, primary responsibility for family care-taking often falls on women, and then it says employment standards that apply to just one gender have serious potential for encouraging employers to discriminate against people of that gender.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.910" offset="1490770">So what I take that to mean is that, without this, State employers as well as others tend to say to the woman, You go take care of your sick mother, and because employers know that, they won't hire women.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.932" offset="1558793">That's what it says in (5) and (6), and I would have thought that sounded like equal protection of the laws, as if this statute is designed to help remove one of the major reasons why employers discriminate against women.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.513" offset="1625144">That's what (5) and (6) says, and then the... 10 lines down it says, pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul G. Taggart</label>
            <text syncTime="376.134" offset="1651580">Well, Justice Breyer, the statement here, in our view, indicates why Congress adopted a gender-neutral statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.002" offset="1683136">If it adopted a gender-specific statute, the statute itself would have been subject to challenge under the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.863" offset="1706542">Our... our concern here is that any everyday economic legislation that may have a disparate benefit to one suspect classification or another will all of a sudden be... have the power to abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity, and then State immunity will be subject to abrogation at... at any expense where Congress deems that Commerce Clause legislation is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.345" offset="1792432">Congress should not be allowed to do indirectly what it's prohibited from doing directly.</text>

            <text syncTime="425.817" offset="1850320">I think you can distill those statements down to something like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.730" offset="1869964">We know for a fact historically that, whenever burdens of family responsibility are allocated, they are allocated to the woman, not to the man.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.476" offset="1925030">If we do not have an employment standard that expressly says you have got to treat them exactly alike, the women will always get the short end, and that will be reflected in hiring decisions, among others.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.421" offset="1984798">Secondly, in order to make this determination a practical one, we can't simply leave it that whatever you do for men you should do for women, or vice versa.</text>

            <text syncTime="490.711" offset="2109977">That doesn't sound to me like simply an end run, a phony Commerce Clause argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="1571.617" offset="6433556">The Family Medical Leave Act is an appropriate response to enduring problems of State sex discrimination bias against women in hiring and promotion because employers assume that women are more likely than men to leave their jobs to go take care of their family members, and bias against men in the dispensing of family leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.508" offset="6533134">Congress gathered ample recent evidence of these mutually reinforcing problems, and Congress also built on a known foundation of State laws and decisions fostering different roles for men and women in work and family.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.112" offset="6595515">Those different roles and beliefs about them persist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.033" offset="6611188">Offering a threshold amount of leave to men and women alike is responsive to the problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.342" offset="6640445">The act has successfully encouraged more men to take the leave, and in narrowing the gap between men's and women's leave rates, the act erodes the very basis of employers' bias against women.</text>

            <text syncTime="3217.038" offset="13015263">--Well, the... the key here, Justice Scalia, is that after the period that is recognized as pregnancy disability, and therefore constitutional under Geduldig, beyond that, parental leave, infant care leave is simply parental leave, and there's no difference whether the mother or the father takes care of the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.415" offset="13084749">Indeed, the law would not countenance such a difference, because that would be relying on the very presumptions that the law condemns.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.254" offset="13108050">And so the key here is that if there is an additional grant of leave to either sex beyond the period of pregnancy disability, that would constitute a violation of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.640" offset="13149637">It would not constitute a violation of the FMLA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.157" offset="13159668">The reason for that is very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.015" offset="13167192">The FMLA was enacted as part of the overall antidiscrimination scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.678" offset="13185791">It supplements and does not supplant Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.476" offset="13200942">It paints a little bit more broad... more broadly than Title VII in the sense that it grants affirmative leave rights, but in one further, in one important respect it paints very much more narrowly, as your... as your question to my colleague, Mr. Taggart, had indicated, Justice Kennedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.763" offset="13274085">That is because it is very narrowly tailored to the particular problem that Congress was facing, which is the problem of employment discrimination based on leave-taking propensities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.562" offset="13325285">And so in that sense it is perfectly congruent to the constitutional problem that Congress was addressing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.908" offset="13354751">Congress could not very well have addressed the problem of gender-based differentials and the presumptions in law and in practice that arise from those differentials by granting additional leave rights only to women, or granting leave rights only to men that would perpetuate the discrimination and the presumptions, rather than eliminate it root and branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.259" offset="13436148">The key to the money damages is the same key as it is in our general antidiscrimination statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.599" offset="13469480">That should not be a surprising... Title VII has the same type of damage remedies, and the reason for that is that discrimination, whether it be for race or for gender, is pervasive and pernicious and historically recognized by this Court, and so Congress has made a judgment that it needs as many hands on deck as possible in order to enforce the effort to eradicate discrimination, and money damages is part of the normal remedy in order to ensure that plaintiffs are made whole and State actors are deterred from acting unconstitutionally or, in this case, in violation of the section (5) legislation that is at the... the... at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.446" offset="13640844">The fact that... if I may return to the point that the fact that it should not be surprising that this Court assumed in Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer that the... that Congress had authority under section (5) to include gender discrimination in Title VII, because in the same year was the year that the Court for the first time extended heightened scrutiny in Craig v. Boren, so--</text>

            <text syncTime="3399.331" offset="13744393">First, it's important to distinguish that paternity leave and leave for childbirth and when a child is adopted is not the question that was presented to this Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.021" offset="13787129">The question presented to this Court is family leave, and there's certainly no record of family leave differentials, as has been argued with respect to parenting leave, and second, it is not possible under any jurisprudence of this Court to simply presume that State managers discriminate based upon some stereotype.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.059" offset="13859332">Title VII doesn't do that, the Equal Protection Clause, this Court's section (1) jurisprudence that interprets the Equal Protection Clause doesn't do that, the heightened scrutiny test does not do that, it does not allow someone to simply presume that State managers are using some... some outdated stereotype in making their decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.399" offset="13928713">The third point I want to make is, it's our position that one who reads the text and the history of the Family and Medical Leave Act would hardly recognize the statute that has been described here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.294" offset="13972285">This was simply every-day economic legislation, and upholding the FMLA would simply tear section (5) from any remedial moorings by allowing a general legislative power of Congress to grant economic benefits so long as there is some incidental benefit to some suspect class.</text>

            <text syncTime="3492.582" offset="14117422">We also have our own State medical leave laws, so States have joined, and have actually led the Federal Government in providing family leave for their employees, and to simply say, and ignore that... that pattern and say instead that States are engaged in a pattern of discrimination, or were engaged in 1993 in a pattern of discrimination, in our view does not stand up to any of this Court's section (1) jurisprudence.</text>
