            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="85435">The opinion of the Court in No. 01-1289, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company against Campbell will be announced by Justice Kennedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="9.208" offset="122215">In this case from the Utah Supreme Court, we addressed once again the subject of punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.030" offset="149487">Curtis Campbell was insured by State Farm Insurance Company and he ended up suing his own company.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.534" offset="179476">The background was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.241" offset="186372">Campbell and his wife were driving on a two-lane high way in Utah; Campbell decided to pass six vans traveling ahead of him.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.444" offset="219182">This resulted in an accident that caused one driver his life and rendered another permanently disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.667" offset="244051">Campbell escaped unscathed.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.898" offset="257007">Campbell was sued and the insurance company State Farm turned down a settlement offer for the $50,000 policy limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.074" offset="293683">The jury found Campbell a 100% at fault and returned a verdict for about $185,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.380" offset="318865">So, there is an excess amount over the policy limit of $135,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.664" offset="340077">At first, State Farm refused to pay the excess, later it agreed to do so but Campbell sued State Farm nonetheless alleging bad faith, fraud and intentional infliction of emotional distress.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.937" offset="389082">In Campbell's suit against State Farm, the jury awarded him $2.6 million in compensatory damages and $145 million in punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.035" offset="429520">The Trial Court ordered the compensatory damages reduced to $1 million and the punitive damages reduced to $25 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.969" offset="465255">Utah Supreme Court reinstated the $145 million punitive damage award and this is the decision we now review.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.667" offset="508096">Sstate have discretion over the imposition of punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.601" offset="527740">It is well established though that there are procedural and substantive constitutional limitations on those awards.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.849" offset="556788">In BMW of North America versus Gore, we instructed courts reviewing punitive damages to consider three guideposts: first, the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant's misconduct; second, the disparity between the harm sufferend by the plaintiff and the punitive damages award, and third, the difference between the punitive damages awarded by the jury and civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.452" offset="687192">Under these principles, this case is neither close nor difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.284" offset="702552">It was error to reinstate the jury's $145 million punitive damages award.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.723" offset="732227">In applying the first Gore guidepost, we must acknowledge that State Farm's handling of the claims against Campbell merits no praise.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.615" offset="771828">While we do not suggest there was an error in awarding any punitive damages based upon State Farm's conduct toward Campbell, a more modest punishment for this reprehensible conduct could have satisfied the State's legitimate objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.093" offset="821775">The Utah Courts should have gone no further.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.472" offset="835254">The case instead was used as a platform to expose and punish the perceived deficiencies of State Farm's operation throughout the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.002" offset="869422">The Utah Supreme Court's opinion makes explicit that State Farm was being condemned for its nationwide policies, rather than for the conduct directed to Campbell.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.314" offset="906620">From opening statements onward Campbell framed this case as a chance to rebuke State Farm for its nationwide activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.710" offset="940266">The State cannot punish a defendant for conduct that may have been lawful where it occured nor as a general rule does a State have a legitimate concern in imposing punitive damages to punish a defendant for unlawful acts commited outside of the State's jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.676" offset="1004109">Lawful-out-of-state conduct maybe probative where it demonstrates the deliberateness and culpability of the defendant's action in the State where it is tortious, but that conduct must have a nexus to the specific harm suffered by the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.094" offset="1069729">Also, the the Utah Courts erred in relying upon this and other evidence for a fundamental reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.909" offset="1093030">Punitive damages were awarded to punish and deter conduct that borne no relation to Campbell's harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.287" offset="1118526">The defendant's dissimilar acts independent from the acts upon which liability was premised may not serve as the basis for punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.473" offset="1163247">Due process does not permit courts in the calculation of punitive damages to adjudicate the merits of other parties' hypothetical claims against the defendant under the guise of the reprehensibility analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.659" offset="1219985">Turning to the second Gore guidepost, we have been reluctant to identify concrete constitutional limits on the ratio between the harm that the plaintiff usually reflected in the compensatory damages award and the punitive damage award.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.457" offset="1287172">Our jurisprudence and the principles have now established demonstrate, however, that in practice, few awards exceeding a single-digit ratio between punitve and compensatory damages will satisfy due process, and compensatory damages are substantial moreover than a lesser ratio perhaps only equal to compensatory damages can reach the outermost limit of the due process guarantee.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.437" offset="1391139">In the context of this case, we have no doubt that there is a presumption against an award that has 145:1 ratio.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.359" offset="1426771">With respect to the third Gore guidepost, the most relevant civil sanction under Utah Law for the wrong done to Campbell appears to be a $10,000 fine for an act of fraud, an amount dwarfed by the $145 million punitive damages award.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.038" offset="1493539">An application of the Gore guidepost to the facts of this case likely would justify a punitive damages award at or near the amount of compensatory damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.927" offset="1537112">The punitive award of $145 million was neither reasonable nor proportionate to the wrong committed, and it was an irrational and arbitrary deprivation of the property of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.211" offset="1582251">The judgment of the Utah Supreme Court is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.372" offset="1594895">Justices Scalia, Thomas and Ginsburg have each filed disserting opinions.</text>
