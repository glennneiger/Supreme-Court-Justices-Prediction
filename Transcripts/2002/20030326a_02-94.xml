            <text syncTime="9.166" offset="188248">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the lower courts in this case were wrong for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.968" offset="219491">First, because the Constitution does not give prison inmates a right to receive in-person visits since that activity is inherently inconsistent with the status as a prisoner and with legitimate penological objectives and second, because the Michigan visitation rules are rational and reasonably related to legitimate penological interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.138" offset="308203">The Court has recognized the right of intimate association with certain people in certain circumstances outside of the prison context in cases such as Roberts v. United States Jaycees.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.748" offset="366613">In Turner v. Safley, the Court examined the question of how to evaluate a right which is recognized outside of the prison context and determine whether it applies inside the prison.</text>

            <text syncTime="81.695" offset="478417">In Roberts, the Court also identified several attributes of the right of intimate association which respondents assert.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.240" offset="512585">These rights include a high degree of selectivity and decisions regarding the affiliations, seclusion from others, relative smallness of the group.</text>
