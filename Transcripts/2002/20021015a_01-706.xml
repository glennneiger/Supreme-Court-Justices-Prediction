            <text syncTime="66.432" offset="416834">The question presented in this case is whether State common law tort claims that a boat engine was defective because it lacked a propeller guard are preempted either by the Boat Safety Act of 1971 or by an unpublished Coast Guard letter stating that the agency had decided not to take any regulatory action with respect to propeller guards.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.457" offset="512860">There is no express preemption here because the Boat Safety Act includes a savings clause that expressly preserves the availability of common law claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.789" offset="550267">And in light of this clause, this case boils down to the question of whether our claims are impliedly preempted because they conflict with some valid expression of Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.958" offset="594884">And the answer to this question is no for two distinct reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.799" offset="610244">First, as the United States has argued, the Coast Guard letter itself lacks the force of law regardless of its content.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.417" offset="644726">And second, even if the Coast Guard could preempt State law in this fashion, there's no preemption here because our claims are entirely consistent with the Coast Guard's stated reasons for not taking any regulatory action with respect to propeller guards.</text>

            <text syncTime="213.133" offset="1003648">In our view that statute would be valid because we read 4306 as not even preempting State positive law, that is, laws and regulations, unless there's an actual Coast Guard standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="244.741" offset="1129976">One, our reading of the statute is that it only kicks in where the Coast Guard has regulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.895" offset="1146695">The United States disagrees on this point and reads 4306 as expressly preempting all forms of State positive law, that is, laws and regulations, even where the Coast Guard hasn't regulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.752" offset="1190058">But the United States and we agree that however you read 4306 with respect to State positive law, common law claims are preserved, and the reason is that 4311(g) would be stripped of any meaning if 4306 is read as encompassing common law claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="332.163" offset="1479704">You can... it not only is a savings clause for common law, it's also a savings clause for State law.</text>

            <text syncTime="358.333" offset="1584403">Now, you can't read the savings clause portion that says under State law to mean all State law because then the savings clause would totally cancel the preemption clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="408.352" offset="1784500">Second, the reference to State law can easily be understood as a reference to, as the statute itself says, liability imposed under State law, which we read to mean a reference to State damages statutes such as wrongful death and survival.</text>

            <text syncTime="904.291" offset="3768239">I respectfully disagree, Justice Ginsburg, and... and here's why.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.681" offset="3785794">The respondent here does contend that the savings clause applies to breach of warranty and negligent manufacturing claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.931" offset="3814737">And that argument fails, first of all, because such claims are not encompassed within 4306 on its face, and therefore there wouldn't have been any need for Congress to save those claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.407" offset="3856742">Secondly, this Court construed a similar savings clause in Geier as expressing Congress's intent that mere compliance with minimum safety standards would not be an absolute defense to liability in a product liability action.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.410" offset="3924660">And compliance with a Coast Guard regulation establishing a minimum safety standard could never be an absolute defense in a case involving negligent manufacture or a breach of warranty, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.665" offset="3981712">So, the respondent's theory leaves really no meaningful role for the savings clause to play.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.986" offset="4006998">And I would emphasize that these arguments were all asked and answered in Geier, and the Court held that a similarly worded savings clause, albeit without the reference to State law, has to mean that common law claims are not expressly preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.134" offset="4063632">Now, that doesn't mean that our claims must necessarily be permitted to go forward if they conflict with Federal law, but there's clearly no conflict here again for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.982" offset="4103025">First, the Coast Guard letter lacks the force of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.181" offset="4111802">And on that point, before turning to the reasons why our claims are actually consistent with the Coast Guard's stated reasons for declining to regulate, I would further note that not only is there no regulation, no rulemaking here, but the Coast Guard letter was never even published in the Federal Register.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.005" offset="4171047">It was never made available to the public in any formal way whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.062" offset="4187348">And it doesn't even purport to set forth a definitive agency position on the subject of propeller guards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.001" offset="4211067">What the letter says is that the agency is going to continue to consider the matter and gather further data.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.053" offset="4239279">And so, this letter itself lacks the force of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.746" offset="4250042">The second reason, of course, is that even if the Coast Guard could preempt simply by writing a letter, our claims are not inconsistent with the Coast Guard's stated reasons for declining to regulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.891" offset="4286613">The Coast Guard was focusing on the lack of a universally acceptable propeller guard solution, the costs of a retrofit, and such other matters, and there's no inconsistency between our claims--</text>

            <text syncTime="3268.060" offset="13223312">You can't turn the boat safely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.348" offset="13232507">There's a danger of blunt trauma injury that is worse than the propeller slices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.314" offset="13256331">A surgeon can slice up propeller slices occasionally, but the blunt trauma injury from a propeller guard is lethal if it hits you in the chest or in the head.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.713" offset="13293947">And it... it... the steering is interfered with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.251" offset="13304083">You have to double the horsepower of these engines once you put a big bird cage around or a big circle around the propeller guard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.129" offset="13331563">There... there are thousands of pounds per square inch of pressure exerted on these propeller guards, and they create a serious navigation hazard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.955" offset="13362910">And it... it isn't just the committee that in 1990 concluded that these were dangerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.826" offset="13386420">These were 30 experts on safety appointed by the Secretary of Transportation that assigned all these dangers and feasibility problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.365" offset="13424559">And this is exactly, by the way, what seven courts have held who've looked on... at propeller guards on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.555" offset="13453294">They've held that these devices are not feasible and that they're dangerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.831" offset="13466355">There's not a single court in the United States that has said that these have to be installed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.192" offset="13483805">And so, this is the problem, the real world problem, of having individual juries listen to those who lost before the administrative forum on propeller guards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.687" offset="13525810">Okay, we're going to start all over again in the court system, and now we're going to get juries to start commanding installation of propeller guards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.489" offset="13557052">There's a real world hazard, a danger for the public, and Congress has wisely drafted this statute to protect us and our children against that risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.483" offset="13592997">Now, these devices clearly raise policy concerns of nationwide significance and that's why the Coast Guard had to consider these issues in proceedings around the country that lasted for 18 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.903" offset="13642629">Many sectors of society are affected by these devices, and Congress just did not intend that individual juries were going to make these decisions for the whole country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.176" offset="13679723">This would be extraterritorial regulation with a vengeance, just what this Court said in Locke should not be done under State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.857" offset="13710443">Now, my friend also has argued in the brief that safety is the goal of the Boat Safety Act, and that uniformity is just a secondary concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.939" offset="13750776">But Congress did pursue its safety agenda through a particular method, and that was uniform standards for marine equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.410" offset="13784736">Congress wanted the whole Nation to benefit from safe and efficient standards, and it wanted the whole Nation to be protected against standards and requirements that represent risky experiments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.347" offset="13828412">And that's just what propeller guards are.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.420" offset="13836772">And that's why the Coast Guard said in 1991 that these standards have to meet stringent Federal criteria before they're imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.411" offset="13868745">And that does bring us back to congressional intent because when Congress passed this preemption provision, the States were starting to adopt requirements for battery covers and for warning placards on boats and for lines and anchors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.564" offset="13921304">And Congress said, that's fine, but we can't have 50 sets of these requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.659" offset="13937709">We've got to be uniform set of these requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.907" offset="13946695">And it is untenable to conclude that although the harbor master at Belmont Harbor cannot compel the installation of propeller guards, the Circuit Court of Cook County is perfectly free to do that with a big threat of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.408" offset="14000716">Both of these are exercises of Illinois law and they're both preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.035" offset="14019211">We accordingly urge this Court to affirm the decision of the Illinois Supreme Court.</text>

            <label>Ms. Leslie A. Brueckner</label>
            <text syncTime="3476.171" offset="14055782">Your Honor, the... the maritime argument was waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.604" offset="14073441">The reason the United States never briefed it is that respondents didn't even raise it in their opposition brief to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.218" offset="14095906">It was never raised until they filed their brief on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.908" offset="14106669">This is not the time or place to decide the issue raised by respondent, particularly the Yamaha question that was specifically left reserved in Justice Ginsburg's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.829" offset="14142404">On the savings clause, their whole argument is that the savings clause must be read simply to preserve breach of warranty and negligent installation claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.778" offset="14178140">Not only is this not supported by the language of the clause, which is itself broad, but the legislative history of the Boat Safety Act in the Senate report... let's forget about the Commandant for the time being.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.605" offset="14229444">The Senate report states... and I'm quoting from the blue brief at 32... that the purpose of this section to assure that in a product liability suit mere compliance with the minimum standards promulgated under the act will not be a complete defense to liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.953" offset="14294855">This demonstrates that Congress had in mind product liability actions just like this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.118" offset="14315544">Respondent also claims that these boats are... are terribly... that propeller guards are terribly hazardous and the Coast Guard has found this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.421" offset="14344696">Well, first of all, the Coast Guard letter doesn't say anything about the hazards of propeller guards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.810" offset="14358280">And contrary to Mr. Shapiro's contention, in April 2001, the Coast Guard's advisory committee issued... stated in its minutes a recommendation that the Coast Guard actually require propeller guards as one of four permitted options on boats exactly like this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.388" offset="14428602">This is... the cite is on page 11, footnote 14 of the yellow brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.105" offset="14447514">So not only did the Coast Guard not find in 1990 that propeller guards are hazardous, but it's considering requiring them on boats just like this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.200" offset="14475831">On the conflicting judgments point, Mr. Shapiro raises the specter of conflicting jury verdicts in these cases and Congress cannot possibly have intended that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.408" offset="14512716">That's exactly the result that Congress permitted in the context of motor vehicles where, absent a Federal safety standard, the States are... juries are permitted to impose whatever liability they choose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.443" offset="14556811">And even where there's a minimum standard, under Geier, jury verdicts may be permitted to go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.212" offset="14575932">But if... and indeed there are conflicting jury verdicts that arise, the Coast Guard can step into the breach, and as Justice Ginsburg suggested, State legislatures could pass a rule saying that no liability could be imposed in cases like this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.453" offset="14628909">I would also point out on this conflicting jury verdict problem that we are not seeking punitive damages in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.686" offset="14657852">Punitive damages are not available in Illinois in a wrongful death action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.987" offset="14671018">Finally, I would note that the absence of a regulation is itself reason to find no preemption here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.827" offset="14706336">This statute, as we read it, provides that common law claims may be permitted to go forward unless there's a conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.934" offset="14730786">Here there's no regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3646.676" offset="14737787">There's no formal statement of agency purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.456" offset="14748863">There's no articulated reasons that our claim could possibly conflict with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.564" offset="14765372">And finally, at the end of the day, we have a victim here who would be left without any compensation whatsoever if this Court holds that common law claims are preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.085" offset="14807377">We would urge this Court to permit our claims to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.224" offset="14819916">Thank you.</text>
