            <text syncTime="30.936" offset="269627">Under these principles, corporate shareholders and officers are not vicariously liable for the torts of the other agents of the corporation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1401.877" offset="5753356">Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.561" offset="5764118">I'd like to begin by addressing the veil-piercing and the preserving issue, particularly with respect to Justice Scalia's question because I disagree with my learned friend on the procedural posture of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.738" offset="5812811">There was a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.043" offset="5826081">In the complaint at that time, there were essentially two theories.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.540" offset="5844053">The complaint said that Mr. Meyer should be liable as an individual because he owned the corporation, and the complaint also said that Mr. Meyer should be liable because he was the officer/broker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.223" offset="5890760">The district court granted in part, even with respect to the Fair Housing Act claim, the 12(b)(6) motion and, in particular, held that the allegations of the complaint with respect to ownership under no circumstances could lead to liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.451" offset="5971635">And the only thing that the district court did not grant 12(b)(6) on was the issue with respect to liability based on officer/broker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.225" offset="6014789">That led to discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.312" offset="6031090">The district court then granted summary judgment because it was the district court's theory on that issue that there could not be liability unless Mr. Meyer held an individual broker's license as opposed to what he holds in this case, which is a license through Triad, or more properly, according to the California law, Triad holds the license through him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.113" offset="6134326">So with all respect, what the district court held in the 12(b)(6) motion was that no set of facts that the plaintiffs could prove could justify veil-piercing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2106.331" offset="8571132">One is that petitioner wants to take certain parts of the California corporation and real estate law that are advantageous to him, but he doesn't want to take the other part, which is the responsibility part.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.729" offset="8632781">It is literally true that in California, a corporation can be a broker, but it cannot be a broker unless there is an individual appointed who is an officer of the corporation and has qualified under the broker requirements, and that individual is required by California law to take responsibility for the supervision and control of the agency.</text>

            <text syncTime="3157.753" offset="12776847">I think it's also important to note that courts are typically more willing to pierce the veil in tort cases than in contract cases; that this Court has described the Fair Housing Act as... as essentially defining a new type of tort.</text>
