            <text syncTime="71.319" offset="436034">Congress specified in section 404 that a permit is required for an activity that is an addition of a pollutant to a navigable water.</text>

            <text syncTime="99.228" offset="547629">Those statutory terms, we believe, have a core of plain meaning that excludes a farmer and rancher, deep plowing in a seasonal wetland, to prepare the soil for deep-rooted crops.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.036" offset="614921">A deep plowing of that sort does not add fill material or dredged material, and it doesn't involve a point source.</text>

            <text syncTime="148.591" offset="745115">In the summary judgment ruling, the court found, as a matter of law, that plowing that moved material that was already in the wetland... and this is page 36 of the petition appendix... was a violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.295" offset="815855">When it came to hearing evidence, for that reason the court did not focus on the question of whether material was added to the wetland, as the Government says, from... from outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.173" offset="859427">The penalty in this case was based on 358 rips, passes, of the plow across the wetlands.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.219" offset="903626">The court did not distinguish, in any of those cases, as between passes that brought outside material into the wetland and those that didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.797" offset="945944">It simply was not a focus.</text>

            <text syncTime="2254.271" offset="9167828">The record actually shows that it occurred in at least 33 of the 40 wetlands that are involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.144" offset="9191339">The district court made reference to it only in those three cases where it was the only movement of that material.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.699" offset="9213490">But it's easy to see that the three cases that are cited in the district court's opinion refer to those cases where the ripper passed next to a wetland but didn't go in and pushed... nevertheless, pushed soil into the wetland.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.434" offset="9260511">The same thing would happen in those areas where the ripper actually intruded through the wetland as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.973" offset="9282663">So in the case of all of the... the areas, the 29 areas that were filled, all of them had movement of material from upland into the wetlands.</text>

            <text syncTime="3159.127" offset="12787250">And so what this does is it exempts the party from having to get a section 404 permit for activities that would otherwise constitute dredge or fill activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.716" offset="12829569">And the fact that Congress has chosen to exempt activities, including specifically plowing, indicates that Congress understood that plowing could result in a point source addition of pollutants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.694" offset="12877530">Now, what Congress additionally did is it... it states on the carryover... there's a number of other matters that are exempted as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.798" offset="12909921">It indicates that these activities are not regulated under section 301 or section 404 or section 402, for that matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.230" offset="12943672">But then on the paragraph on page 4a, it recaptures those provisions when they result in a change of use, when someone, such as in this case, decides to take a ranch and subdivide it and sell it as farmettes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.835" offset="12994036">And it... and even that recapture provision only applies when it reduces the reach of waters, which is what happened in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.235" offset="13023711">As the district court found, these waters were filled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.255" offset="13035727">They are no longer wetlands, and the idea that these areas are going to be resealed finds no support in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.872" offset="13058193">The district court found here that what were once wetlands are now orchards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.441" offset="13076478">These are not areas that include wetland... or have wetland characteristics any longer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.955" offset="13094555">I would simply like to touch on... since we... we have bounced around among the three issues here quite a bit, I'd like to simply say a few more words about the civil penalty provision because I think it's important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.276" offset="13143874">The legal issue that's before the Court on the civil penalty is... is whether a penalty ought to be assessed in terms of determining the maximum penalty on a per-day basis or on the basis of the number of violations per day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.509" offset="13192775">And the Congress made... made quite clear that it wanted the latter to be the basis for determining the maximum civil penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.963" offset="13226526">It amended the statute in 1987 to eliminate any ambiguity that might exist with regard to the... to that provision, and it's quite clear that it does apply to every violation each day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.600" offset="13277099">Now, it takes into account that some violations can be continuing and go on for a long period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.031" offset="13294862">And those are treated as receiving a $25,000 a day penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.300" offset="13315969">But in the case of the violations we have here, they all occurred in one day on the basis the district court analyzed the... the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.194" offset="13343450">Finally, I'd like to make the point that the district court needs to have a great deal of discretion in determining how to apply the penalty provisions that are involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.889" offset="13374274">There are different ways to calculate violations, determine what is the appropriate measure of violations, but ultimately the fairness turns on the district court's judgment of the individual penalty factors that are considered here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.977" offset="13426624">In this case, the court took into account all those factors, including the economic benefits that the party received by avoiding its legal obligations in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.235" offset="13463717">It's important to remember there are land developers, ranchers, and farmers out there that do comply with the statute, that do comply with the regulations, and they are, in effect, penalized if in fact people who ignore the law are allowed to go forward and not be subject to a substantial penalty in cases in which they have violated the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.817" offset="13538010">In this case the penalties are less than what actually would be necessary to recoup the economic benefit that they received according to the... the facts that the district court put forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.509" offset="13576775">The court of the... or excuse me... the... the Government put forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.337" offset="13588060">The district court recognized there was some uncertainty with regard to determining economic benefit, but nevertheless I think chose a very reasonable approach here in terms of requiring both a mitigation remedy and also a substantial civil penalty.</text>

            <text syncTime="3392.175" offset="13719404">On page 36 of the petition appendix, the... the district court, in describing what the plowing here did, said that it broke up, mixed, turned over material already in the pools, swales, and intermittent streams.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.377" offset="13776246">If you turn to page 86 through 91, where the court describes in detail factual findings after hearing the evidence on the impacts on waters, on only three... as to three of the jurisdictional features does the court say that there is any fill coming in from outside, and that is where there is upland plowing parallel to a drainage that pushes a small amount of material into the very margins of the wetland.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.484" offset="13892648">And the reason that the court didn't need to get into this is, A, that it had made a legal finding to begin with that soil disturbed within a wetland was a discharge, and B, that there was a factual dispute here about the extent to which we have pulled up the plows before we entered across from the upland to the... to the wetland.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.846" offset="13970075">And the court didn't want to deal with... with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.938" offset="13978434">And it didn't have to under this notion that if you disturb soil within a wetland, that's an addition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.590" offset="13997033">Second, I'd like to point out on page 8a of the... of the Government's addendum the regulation about plowing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.834" offset="14038098">Plowing means all forms of primary tillage including moldboard, chisel, and wide-blade plowing, discing, harrowing, and similar means utilized on the farm to break up, cut, turn over, or stir the soil to prepare it for the planting of crops.</text>

            <text syncTime="3552.754" offset="14361703">And Congress reacted to that by, as one commentator has said, a provision that reflects the fact that it didn't think that one stake through the heart of the vampire was enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.094" offset="14403081">This is a belt and suspenders provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.785" offset="14413843">But what it does, as you remarked Justice Scalia, is to provide an exemption for agricultural activities that are discharges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.390" offset="14452295">It doesn't change the definition of point source, fill material, dredged material, addition in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.110" offset="14479149">It doesn't change any of the operative terms in the statute that we think mean this activity is not a... a discharge to begin with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.822" offset="14502033">And the exemption also mentions other activities, seeding and cultivation and harvesting, that just are not... I mean, these are not discharges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.210" offset="14543515">These do not result in the addition of fill and dredged material from... to the... to the wetland.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.477" offset="14576638">And... and that is why this structure is what's reflected in the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.994" offset="14598686">The regulation on page 8a.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.430" offset="14604433">It says plowing, as described above... I mean, they purport to exclude what we did from the definition of plowing, but plowing, as described above, will never involve a discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.962" offset="14646542">It's not a discharge to begin with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.200" offset="14651557">You don't get into the 404(f) exemption.</text>
