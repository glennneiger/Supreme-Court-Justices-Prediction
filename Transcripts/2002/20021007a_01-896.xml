            <text syncTime="32.326" offset="273858">The Court would appreciate hearing argument on, I'm sure, not just on the question presented in the petition for certiorari, but on the question posed in the supplemental briefing about whether there is appellate jurisdiction where a nominally prevailing party in the district court can... can appeal, and also about whether the question of... under 1447(d), if this was an order of remand, whether the... the thing was appealable to the Ninth Circuit at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="60.817" offset="387856">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="63.675" offset="399246">Perhaps with that observation, I would... it would behoove me to address the quest... the appellate jurisdiction of this Court first, as much as I would like to rush into why there clearly is subject matter jurisdiction in this case, regardless of whether the plaintiffs' claims for injunctive relief are viewed as separate and distinct or common and then divide it.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.641" offset="479076">So let me first address why I think the Ninth Circuit and this Court had appellate jurisdiction, and it is straightforward.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.615" offset="506975">That is, there is an appeal in this case from the dismissal with prejudice of a consolidated complaint which was filed voluntarily by the plaintiffs in this case seeking... as against plaintiffs that are different than any... than the constituent State court actions, including different plaintiffs seeking different causes of action and seeking a different form of relief, that is, specific performance of the Ford rebate program.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.125" offset="629019">And it is very clear, both from the cont... the... the four corners of the consolidated complaint and from an express representation that my friend, Mr. Berman, made at the oral argument in the class certification stage, that the consolidated complaint was filed for the purpose of obtaining, in front of Judge Dwyer in the Northern Dis... the Western District of Washington, a judgment on the merits in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.636" offset="735076">That is, it was different than the treatment, the maximum treatment, that he would have been permitted to provide under the multi-district litigation panel's reference.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.237" offset="781469">That is--</text>

            <text syncTime="159.900" offset="784186">What's sort of unusual, though, is that you didn't suffer the dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.487" offset="798501">I mean, yes, a dismissal is... is usually a final... a final action, and it's usually the person whose suit was dismissed who appeals--</text>

            <text syncTime="180.480" offset="866524">--Indeed, and that, Justice Scalia, is the... is the question I believe, the specific question, that the Court directed the parties' attention to in its request for supplemental briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.489" offset="902468">Now, it is clear that a prevailing party normally cannot appeal, but the operative word that this Court has recognized, at least since the Electrical Fittings case, is normally.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.334" offset="957848">And this Court and the lower courts have applied a rather particular test to determine when normally doesn't apply, and that is, is the nominally prevailing party sufficiently aggrieved by a decision in its favor that it retains a, quote, stake in the appeal?</text>
            <text syncTime="224.338" offset="1041858">And that's... that test was articulated by this Court in Guaranty Trust v. Roper--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="232.132" offset="1073100">Mr. Waxman, a defendant who removes a case and then is remanded is surely aggrieved but, nonetheless, cannot appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.576" offset="1118867">And the problem I have with an answer that you went by too fast for me is this case is in... was in the Washington district court for pretrial purposes only under 1407.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.151" offset="1181143">The transfer from the several district courts to which these cases were initially removed... that transfer under the statute was for pretrial purposes only, not for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.893" offset="1240075">And after the pretrial, under the statute, the cases, unless all the parties consent, would go back to the district courts from whence they came.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.330" offset="1293887">So I don't understand how the Western District which is dealing with a complaint for pretrial purposes only... I mean, the... the request that a complaint... consolidated complaint be filed was for pretrial processing.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.538" offset="1370687">How do you get from that an action that displaces all of the other actions that had been removed from the State court?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="seth_p_waxman" startTime="317.926" stopTime="439.286">
            <label>Mr. Seth P. Waxman</label>
            <text syncTime="317.926" offset="1416245">Justice Ginsburg, the appealability of the dismissal with prejudice of the consolidated complaint does not depend on whether the consolidated complaint, quote, did away with the other actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.128" offset="1473087">The reason... we would, of course, readily concede that under 1447(d), if all that had happened was a removal of the six State court actions, a transfer for pretrial purposes to a multi-district litigation court and a determination by that court that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the complaints, there would be no appeal because the remand of removed State court actions for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, Congress has decided, is not a determination that may be reviewed by Federal appellate courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.959" offset="1644346">But here... and this, I think, is the salient point.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.028" offset="1660646">Here, the judge did not require the plaintiffs' lawyers in the six cases to file some sort of concordance or a consolidating document that often is ordered so as to facilitate pretrial proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.305" offset="1725744">What the judge said is if anybody wants to file a consolidated complaint, they may.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.587" offset="1750926">The consolidated complaint that was filed in this case avowedly invoked this Court's 13... the Federal court's 1332 jurisdiction and sought not just pretrial consolidated proceedings on discovery and motions, they wanted a full trial or a full resolution on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.141" offset="1849146">In other words, it's... it's as if the judge, having had the six cases transferred, said expressly, look, I'm going to deal with all of the pretrial matters that are the subject of this transfer order, but if you all like me--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="439.286" offset="1901704">Mr. Waxman, may I stop you at that point?</text>
            <text syncTime="440.846" offset="1907974">Because the pretrial consolidated... the order... this is... I'm looking at the appendix, page 35.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.193" offset="1941306">It says, by order of the multi-district panel, the cases have been consolidated for pretrial purposes only.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.749" offset="1975579">Now, you're saying that there is something... something that I don't see in the written orders that says they... no, it's going to be now for trial purposes.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="seth_p_waxman" startTime="469.500" stopTime="532.608">
            <label>Mr. Seth P. Waxman</label>
            <text syncTime="469.500" offset="2022599">--No, no, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.812" offset="2023748">I'm... I'm not explaining myself correctly.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.725" offset="2031481">The... the order doesn't say these six removed cases are here for trial purposes, and if it did, it would exceed the court's authority under 1407 and this Court's specific holding in Lexecon.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.732" offset="2091458">On page 41 of the joint appendix, the court under a heading say... entitled consolidated complaint says, should plaintiffs in all or some of the consolidated actions decide to file a consolidated complaint, you have to do so within a certain period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.225" offset="2169407">Now, that raises the question, since they did it voluntarily, whether what they were filing was something that, in essence, sort to... as I said, to be a concordance, to consolidate in one document all of the various parties and all the various claims and all various theories so that a court can meaningful and... meaningfully and efficiency... efficiently manage the pretrial proceedings.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="532.608" offset="2274942">But ordinarily you wouldn't go... go about it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.661" offset="2283197">You'd have a memorandum, not a consolidated complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="539.197" offset="2301378">That... that's true, Mr. Chief Justice, although there are instances where the court... where the transferee court has ordered the filing of something called a consolidated complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.312" offset="2345786">But here, there are two salient... at least two salient differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.585" offset="2362922">One is this complaint has different parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.545" offset="2374730">It has different causes of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.498" offset="2382566">It seeks a different type of relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.095" offset="2392911">And at the motion... and... and it seeks quite clearly, based on the conduct of the parties and the representations, this is, in essence, saying thank you very much for having... having us here for consolidated proceedings on our underlying state court actions, but we have decided we like you, Judge Dwyer, and we want you to try a case, and we're going to file a brand new Federal action that is docketed in the Western District.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="590.956" offset="2508372">Mr. Waxman, things like that, juris... basic jurisdictional thing, agreeing... this would be a consent to have a court that has no authority to adjudicate a case to adjudicate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.714" offset="2551422">Usually such a major step is done not by inference, not by implication.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.186" offset="2577335">This is saying, court, even though you have no authority under the Federal statutes to proceed without our consent, we are consenting, so go ahead.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.665" offset="2623206">We're waiving any questions of venue or anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.804" offset="2643791">The fact that this is labeled consolidated complaint is simply what the multi-district statute says.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.648" offset="2671167">It says that the actions may be transferred for consolidated pretrial proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.215" offset="2701365">So why couldn't this consolidated complaint be simply for pretrial proceedings, the only thing that the multi-district panel transferred the case to Western District of Washington for?</text>

            <text syncTime="651.905" offset="2752147">Justice Ginsburg, it certainly could have been, and if it were ordered by the court, that is the most that it could have been.</text>

            <text syncTime="664.126" offset="2801048">There are parties, claims, and requests for relief, and particularly the... what is really the object of the litigation, the request for specific performance of the Ford rebate program--</text>

            <text syncTime="2681.334" offset="10869855">Mr. Chief Justice, my answer to that is I think that the Court could adopt a rule allowing the amount in controversy to be determined from either viewpoint, both from the plaintiffs' viewpoint or from the defendants' viewpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.288" offset="10937668">But that doesn't answer the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.145" offset="10945087">The... the question really presented then is how do we value that amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.095" offset="10964940">And this Court's teachings I think have answered that question, and that is in the Hunt case, the Court has ruled and has consistently followed this proposition, that it is well established that the amount in controversy is measured by the value of the object of the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.007" offset="11036620">And so, another way the Court has put it is what right does the plaintiff seek to have enforced here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2744.632" offset="11123033">--I... I think the Court has never squarely been faced with the issue of should the plaintiff's rule be adopted or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.637" offset="11151141">There is suggestions that it should be, but I think what the Court has been consistent on is looking at the value of the object of litigation from the point of view, what is it that the plaintiff wants, not what are the incidental costs to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.664" offset="11215193">In fact, there is a case... and I... I know it's an old case, but the Ross case and the Elliott case squarely hold that jurisdiction does not depend upon any contingent injuries or damage to a defendant in a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.187" offset="11269319">And if the rule is otherwise... and by the way, I think there's a big difference, for the purposes of this Court's review, of an administrative cost versus injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.235" offset="11321460">So let me first focus on administrative cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.959" offset="11332431">The mischief, I think, of allowing administrative cost to be considered is illustrated by an earlier Ninth Circuit decision in Snow v. Ford.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.869" offset="11372033">And there the plaintiff sought an injunction because Ford had sold a trailer package without an $11 wiring kit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.012" offset="11408604">And Ford argued then, as it does now, that because it would have to incur substantial costs in supplying this $11 kit, that there was Federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.312" offset="11457819">Well, the value of the object of litigation from the plaintiffs' point of view, if you can't aggregate, which under Snyder v. Harris you can't, is $11.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.688" offset="11503272">If the Court is going to allow administrative cost to be considered, then this Court is going to have hundreds... Federal courts are going to have hundreds of $11 cases in front of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.618" offset="11551024">And I think Judge Posner hit the nail right on the head in the Brand Name Prescription Drug case, in which he said that if the costs of compliance were considered, then every case, virtually every case, quote, however trivial would cross the threshold.</text>

            <text syncTime="3280.782" offset="13267686">The other danger I'll touch on in my last minute of allowing the injunctive... amount it would cost the defendant, either by way of injunction or administrative cost, is that plaintiffs could use this new theory to invoke Federal court jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.972" offset="13328395">The amicus seem to suggest that plaintiffs never want to be in Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.194" offset="13345322">That's not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.436" offset="13350338">If you adopt the petitioners' rule, anytime I have a case where I want to be in Federal court, where I normally could not be in Federal court... and I have many such cases right now... I would just simply have to say in my prayer for relief that the... the injunction would cost the defendant more than $75,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.995" offset="13420555">And bingo, I have a whole new rule and there's a whole new group of Federal cases that suddenly would arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.805" offset="13443752">So in closing, unless there's any questions, the problem with the defendants'... the petitioners' position in this case is that it would open up the flood gates of litigation to the Federal court system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.065" offset="13488787">We cited a RAND Institute study that about 65 percent of the country's class actions are in State courts, and to adopt their rule would mean that many of those, probably thousands of cases, that are now residing in State courts would suddenly find their way into Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.836" offset="13559944">That I think is not consistent with this Court's policy of strictly construing the diversity statute and giving deference to State courts and State governments with respect to laws that they have the power to enact and to have those cases heard in State courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="3381.557" offset="13670808">On appellate jurisdiction, there is no doubt whatsoever that what was intended here was a new complaint about new things to proceed to judgment at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.335" offset="13709887">At page 11 of the transcript of oral argument before the district judge on the class certification issue, the court says,</text>

            <text syncTime="3424.401" offset="13842171">Justice Ginsburg, in response to your question about cases in which a declaratory judgment action was filed where it... the case could have been litigated by a plaintiff class in a consumer case, that was the case in the Greenwood Trust case filed by a bank in the First Circuit that ultimately produced this Court's decision in Smiley which was a consumer class action that came up out of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.254" offset="13945616">Now, with respect to specific performance, specific performance is the object of this complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.719" offset="13975396">It is what they want.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.297" offset="13981770">It is the thing they need in order for any of them to be able to realize the benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.897" offset="14004131">And as this Court said in Mississippi &amp; Missouri River Bridge v. Ward... in that case, it involved removing a bridge obstruction... the removal of the obstruction is the matter of the controversy and the value of the object must govern.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.112" offset="14065048">The complaint itself says they want specific performance of the national rebate program, and if there were any clarification needed, you look at page 45 of the red brief and they explain that that's just what they want.</text>
