            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="152285">We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 01-1418, A. Elliott Archer versus Arlene L. Warner.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.082" offset="188543">Mr. Goldblatt.</text>

            <label>Mr. Craig Goldblatt</label>
            <text syncTime="10.031" offset="192409">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.375" offset="205784">An individual debtor at the end of a bankruptcy case will typically receive a discharge of that debtor's pre-bankruptcy debts.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.663" offset="242878">That discharge, however, is subject to a number of statutory exceptions, each exception reflecting a congressional judgment that a particular category of debt be paid notwithstanding the prior bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.946" offset="300034">Those exceptions include not only debts for money obtained by fraud, debts for injuries caused by drunk driving, and amounts due for alimony and child support.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.811" offset="339426">With respect to the fraud exception at issue here, under the Bankruptcy Code and this Court's cases, a debt is nondischargeable in bankruptcy if the creditor can establish that the underlying debt arises out of an act of fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.456" offset="410061">The question presented in this case is whether a debt that would otherwise be nondischargeable for that reason becomes dischargeable if the parties enter into a settlement agreement that resolves the amount of the debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.134" offset="468785">The court of appeals said that a settlement did have that effect, emphasizing that the effect of a settlement was to trade a fraud claim for a contract action that would be discharged in bankruptcy.</text>

            <text syncTime="93.623" offset="526776">Is it your understanding that if the Fourth Circuit were correct and were to be affirmed in this case, that its rule would be the generally prevailing rule in all of the States, or would certain States differ on whether or not there was, in effect, a novation when there was a settlement agreement?</text>

            <text syncTime="114.306" offset="609428">The question of dischargeability is a question of Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.444" offset="621967">That is how each of the courts of appeals that have addressed the question has treated it.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.326" offset="637536">Indeed, this Court, in Grogan versus Garner, has emphasized that the construction of section 523(a) of the Bankruptcy Code is a question of Federal law.</text>

            <text syncTime="130.818" offset="675465">Well, my... my question, perhaps, was not as clear as it ought to have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.906" offset="691870">The Fourth Circuit placed substantial reliance on the fact that this was a novation under State law, that there was a new debt created superseding the old, et cetera, and my question is whether or not... if we affirm its judgment, that we will find in almost every other State a settlement is also a novation, or will the rule vary from State to State, and if it does vary from State to State, will the Fourth Circuit rule from this particular State be the majority rule or minority?</text>

            <text syncTime="170.822" offset="835544">Your Honor, the court of appeals did, indeed, say that the... the settlement effected a novation.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.342" offset="861562">That is a common rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="284.884" offset="1291746">It's odd that Leonard Warner stipulated that this was a nondischargeable debt, but his wife, who's in the bankruptcy with him, says yes, it is dischargeable.</text>

            <text syncTime="306.803" offset="1379413">Your Honor, Leonard Warner stipulates that the debt is nondischargeable as to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.626" offset="1402714">With respect to Mrs. Warner, it would remain our burden in bankruptcy to show that... that there is an act of fraud that is properly attributable to her, either because she committed it herself or by some principle of agency that it is nondischargeable because of her, so I... I don't believe that the... the stipulation by its terms is... is dispositive on the question of whether it is nondischargeable as... as to her.</text>

            <text syncTime="358.323" offset="1585572">Petitioners assert that they have the right as a matter of Federal bankruptcy law also to continue to recover on this debt as against Mrs. Warner, who also is an obligor on the promissory note.</text>

            <text syncTime="392.669" offset="1722871">In Brown, the parties to a State court litigation resolved that litigation by agreeing to the entry of a consent judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.494" offset="1762159">It was as equally true there, as it is here, that the parties who had been... whose litigation had ended in the consent judgment were barred, in that case by the preclusive effect of the consent judgment, here by the binding effect of the settlement, from bringing a new suit claiming fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.584" offset="1830600">All they could do was enforce the consent judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1628.659" offset="6666910">The first one, to pick up on what Justice O'Connor said, I think there's a fundamental misconception in the question as it's presented and as it was described by Mr. Goldblatt this morning, and this conception is that what we're dealing with here is a categorical rule that says that whenever you have a settlement, because it's a contract, it bars any further pursuit of a nondischarge claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.610" offset="6758652">That is completely inconsistent with the holdings of the court below, all of which looked specifically at the language of the release and concluded that what had specifically been released was the right to pursue the claim under 523.</text>

            <text syncTime="3140.951" offset="12716034">Let me, if I could, just point to the arguments on the other side why this should be treated as essentially a Federal override of State law interpretive principles is based first upon citation of a number of express provisions of the Bankruptcy Code which have nothing to do with the subject and, I think, prove the opposite point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.354" offset="12793669">There's a whole section on debtor reaffirmations which set up detailed procedures that the bankruptcy court enforces to make sure that debtors don't get taken advantage of, and they are specific, and they're clear, and the bankruptcy court follows them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.614" offset="12842675">That's an occasion for the bankruptcy court to get involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.419" offset="12853960">There's the idea that the automatic stay cannot be voluntarily given up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.363" offset="12877679">Again, that's the product of specific language that creates an automatic stay to protect the debtor and has 18 itemized exceptions, specific language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.901" offset="12915818">There... they invoke the preference provisions which let, of course, the bankruptcy court go back into transactions that occur prior to bankruptcy, and look at them on very specific terms set forth in section 547.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.070" offset="12968481">They talk about the fraudulent conveyance section does the same thing in a slightly different way, but there are no such provisions whatsoever with regard to waivers of section 523 claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.383" offset="13013725">Section 523 claims are something that the creditor loses if he does not affirmatively file within 60 days of the first meeting of creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.504" offset="13050296">There are no protections with regard to that in the code, and if... if something isn't filed, they disappear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.911" offset="13071926">Indeed, the whole idea that creditors are... that... that the issues with regard to nondischargeability under (a)(2), (a)(4), (a)(6), and (a)(15), are made a matter of exclusive Federal jurisdiction, the reason for that, and your case and Brown talk specifically about that, is because creditors were abusing the process by pursuing them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.368" offset="13161683">This is not a protection for creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.847" offset="13171609">This is a... a way of making sure creditors don't come in after bankruptcy and basically put the screws to... to debtors who have gotten a discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.278" offset="13201389">What language there is... and we talk about this in both the briefs, I think specific language runs counter to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.995" offset="13232213">We talked in the briefs about (a)(11) and (a)(19), which specifically mention settlements, and I would submit the better interpretation of that language is to say, in those instances where the language specifically says that any settlement may give rise to a nondischargeable claim, is to allow the bankruptcy court to go back in and look at those facts even if the right to a nondischarge... right to pursue nondischarge was given away.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.141" offset="13348824">I think the bottom line is that the arguments on the other side relate to a series... they don't relate to any language of the code, other than the much overbroad idea that it... that it's any debt, and of course that doesn't mean that a party can't be foreclosed from litigating the 523 claim because he's already lost it in State court, so any doesn't mean absolutely every.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.721" offset="13439103">The policies that are invoked are, first, the honest but unfortunate debtor policy, but nobody here, I think, seriously suggests that a party can't give the thing away, give the right away if they want to, and so I think... give the right to pursue the 523 action away by clear enough language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.956" offset="13516007">That seems to be the... the petitioner I think disagrees with me, but other than that, I think the better view is that they can, and I don't think this Court in any of its cases has ever suggested that the honest but unfortunate debtor policy forecloses relying on prior resolutions under State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.792" offset="13603361">Collateral estoppel certainly applies, and we think settlement language that's clear ought to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.448" offset="13626035">They claim that allowing this is some sort of a trap for the unwary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.740" offset="13643172">It would be a trap if the rule were this categorical rule that says, boy, you enter into a settlement contract, you lose your 523 claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.535" offset="13678385">That's not the issue in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.393" offset="13685803">The issue is, does the language here support the... the idea that the... the right to pursue the 523 claim has been given up, and to hold parties to the State law effect of releases that they sign is no trap for the unwary.</text>

I guess... three was the point that when you look at State law here, the reading of... the fair reading of State law does, indeed, support the State law rulings of all three of the courts below, and point four, of course, is that there's no reason in Federal law to go back and say no, we have to second-guess that.</text>

            <label>Mr. Craig Goldblatt</label>
            <text syncTime="3458.334" offset="13985585">Okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.500" offset="13986212">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.410" offset="13989869">I only have four points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.556" offset="13998437">First, with respect to the State law question of preclusion, we say in our reply brief on pages 7 and 8 that that issue had been waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.792" offset="14039397">I don't want to belabor that point, but I... I will point out that the brief respondent filed in the court of appeals, which is... which is, of course, in the record here, states State law correctly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.847" offset="14087671">There, on page 29 in the court of appeals respondent said, there is no issue of collateral estoppel in this case because there have never been any evidentiary findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.257" offset="14125287">We submit that's a correct statement of State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.229" offset="14137199">None of the North Carolina cases cited by respondent involved a case in which a settlement agreement is given preclusive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.652" offset="14170845">Second, with respect to the language of this particular release, it would certainly present a harder case if you had a situation which the release said, we give up all of our rights in bankruptcy, and in the event you file for bankruptcy, we will not make any effort to collect on the debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.936" offset="14251929">This release is quite far from that, and expressly preserves the right at all points to recover on the amount that was promised in the promissory note, and this Court's opinion in Brown makes clear as a matter of Federal law that what a nondischargeability action is is simply an action to enforce the obligations that were promised as part of the settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.325" offset="14345552">Finally, the question of the form of the debt, and whether the form of the debt drove the decision below, there... the Court of appeals certainly does say... and this is in the joint appendix at page 8... I'm sorry, page 9a, footnote 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.987" offset="14436145">It explains quite clearly that a basis for its decision is the notion that the creditor was substituting the tort claim, the fraud claim for a contract claim and rests its decision on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.928" offset="14479926">The consequence of that decision would be that from the creditor's perspective, if a creditor has an unliquidated claim, and this applies not only to claims for fraud but, say, an injury caused by drunk-driving, any of the categories of nondischargeability, if you have an unliquidated claim and they file for bankruptcy, you can contend its nondischargeable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.640" offset="14550770">If, on the other hand, you've litigated all the way to judgment, under Brown you can say in bankruptcy, even if the judgment doesn't say what it's for, that that's nondischargeable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.132" offset="14588804">It would create an anomalous situation in which the middle category, cases that are resolved in settlement agreements that don't resolve the question of liability, the rights in bankruptcy to show nondischargeability is given up, and because the code makes clear that the form of the debt is irrelevant to persons of dischargeability, and because this Court's decision in Brown versus Felsen is essentially indistinguishable from this case, we submit the decision below should be reversed.</text>
