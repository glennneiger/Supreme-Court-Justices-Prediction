            <text syncTime="32.073" offset="275355">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="37.195" offset="295835">There is at least a little irony in the fact that Dean Witter is the litigant here before you, about 27 years past the time when it started with Dean Witter and Byrd the... the move toward closing the courthouse doors to public investors and forcing them into industry-run arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.640" offset="389667">Dean Witter is now back here attempting to place a hurdle in the way of the public investor who ironically at this point seeks to enforce an arbitration agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.521" offset="449226">The issue today before the Court is the extent to which the industry and Dean Witter may now invoke court involvement to interfere with a customer's claims before arbitration and... and to decide whether the customer's claims are timely under a section of an arbitration code providing for a time limitation on eligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.973" offset="550999">The issue is who decides.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.157" offset="559672">It is clear that... that over the years a presumption has developed in favor of arbitrability where there is an arbitration clause in a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.784" offset="610245">And the cases say that that presumption can only be overcome by clear and convincing evidence that the parties agreed to have a court decide arbitrability issues within a... within the scope of an arbitration agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.236" offset="684015">In this case, there is no such evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.007" offset="699166">The arbitration clause in the 1992 agreement between the parties is as broad a clause as one can imagine.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.243" offset="740021">The client agrees that all controversies between her and Dean Witter concerning or arising from any account or any transaction involving Dean Witter and the client, whether or not it occurred in the account, or the construction, performance, or breach of this or any other agreement between us.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.570" offset="809402">It's an industry-designed arbitration clause, meant to be as broad as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.281" offset="832181">The intent clearly is to move cases against brokers by customers out of the courts and into arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.783" offset="866245">That... that 1992 agreement was, of course, followed by a 1997 submission agreement signed by Ms. Howsam which merely states that as an undersigned party, she and her trust submit the present matter in controversy, as set forth in the attached statement of claim, to arbitration in accordance with the Constitution, by-laws, rules, regulations, and/or code of arbitration procedure of the sponsoring organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.469" offset="1000932">In this case, it's the NASD, but the... the other self-regulatory organizations and exchanges have similar rules to the 6-year rule.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="225.901" offset="1050669">It seems to me that some of the language in First Options, which the respondent relies on cuts against your case.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.457" offset="1084942">How... how do you deal with that?</text>

            <label>Mr. Alan C. Friedberg</label>
            <text syncTime="235.935" offset="1090793">Well, first of all, First Options is a case in which there was a question about whether an arbitration agreement existed, which is not the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.833" offset="1130395">And Justice Breyer, writing for the Court, wrote that... that in that situation, the presumption shifts.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.353" offset="1172504">The AT&amp;T case... clearly the... when the question is just the scope of an arbitration agreement, but there is no question about the existence of the agreement, there needs to be clear and unmistakable evidence of an intent to have the courts decide rather than the arbitrators decide.</text>

            <text syncTime="274.234" offset="1244080">The respondents here, of course, argue that because of the not to be submitted clause, the 6 years, that limits the scope of the... of the arbitration agreement.</text>

            <label>Mr. Alan C. Friedberg</label>
            <text syncTime="286.524" offset="1293190">The... the respondent, of course, is... is referring to rule 10304, which says that... that disputes which arose out of transactions or events more than 6 years prior are not eligible for submission to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.614" offset="1393500">First of all, that... that rule is found in a section of the arbitration code.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.331" offset="1420459">It's not found in the agreement itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.137" offset="1431639">And it's found in a section of the Code of Arbitration Procedure.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="324.797" offset="1446268">Well, so is 10324 which you're relying on.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.511" offset="1461105">That is, the arbitrator shall be empowered to interrupt and determine the applicability of.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.289" offset="1476256">I mean, that's--</text>

            <label>Mr. Alan C. Friedberg</label>
            <text syncTime="333.048" offset="1479286">Exactly, Justice Scalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.225" offset="1483988">And the point I was... was trying to make is that... that the code has to be read as... as one code in that... in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.367" offset="1524530">The... it's also, I think, illuminating that the... the section, the 300 series of the code in which that is found, is... is not the eligibility section in the sense that the 100 series is.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.440" offset="1592867">The 300 series is... is basically a procedural, instructive portion of the code for the arbitrators to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.366" offset="1628602">There is some... we... we've made the argument and... and I think it's a valid argument... that eligible for submission can mean a number of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.999" offset="1675100">And... and that it refers, in this case to... it could refer in this case to when the arbitrators take the case under submission, just as this Court takes the case under submission after the petition, after the briefing, after the arguments are made.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.132" offset="1743646">There... there is, of course, the need to get the case in front of a tribunal in order to... to decide whether or not the case is timely.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.303" offset="1804354">So while the rule may prevent the case from going all the way to the end zone, it... it certainly doesn't prevent the... the litigant from or the... the person arbitrating from... from getting out of the starting gate.</text>

            <text syncTime="448.340" offset="1940504">In other words, if... if it's a question of whether you get there at all, it's... the question is arbitrability and the presumption goes one way.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.662" offset="1965791">If the question is how long you stay there if you get in front of that person, that's not an arbitrability question and the presumption goes the other way.</text>

            <text syncTime="467.479" offset="2016991">The... the other point that... that needs to be made is that whether or not this is part of the code, part of an agreement, it falls within the John Wiley and Moses Cone case law as opposed to the First Options holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.467" offset="2092955">And in... in John Wiley, if the Court will recall, there were prerequisites, timeliness prerequisites, to filing for arbitration, which the Court said, because there was an arbitration agreement and there was no dispute about that, were for the arbitrators to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.728" offset="2169964">In Moses H. Cone Hospital, there were... there were prerequisites of timeliness.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.277" offset="2200162">The... as I recall, the arbitration had to be filed within 30 days after an opinion by an architect as to the disputed contracting claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.843" offset="2258467">And so... and... and the Court... the Court clearly said in Moses Cone that the Federal Arbitration Act establishes as a matter of Federal law that any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration, whether the contract involves construction of the contract language itself or an allegation of waiver, delay, or a like defense to arbitrability.</text>

            <text syncTime="1268.907" offset="5222738">First, as this Court held nearly 40 years ago in John Wiley, when the parties have agreed to submit the subject matter of the underlying dispute to arbitration, the question whether the dispute was presented within a contractual time limit is presumptively for the arbitrators even if the time limit is a prerequisite that conditions the duty to arbitrate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2657.638" offset="10777624">That's the basic rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.733" offset="10785984">Then there's a subsidiary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.460" offset="10796955">The subsidiary is, but if what you're interested in is whether the parties agreed to arbitrate the question of arbitrability... see Justice Ginsburg says what is that... at subsidiary rule, what you do is assume that silence means no because only if it's clear and unmistakable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.026" offset="10887234">Then First Options goes on to say we'll give you a couple of examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.755" offset="10906147">An example whether or not a particular merits-related dispute is arbitrable because it was within the scope of a valid arbitration agreement, that is not a question of arbitrability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.620" offset="10969572">Why not?</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.305" offset="10976364">Because the parties, after all, have a contract for arbitrability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.719" offset="10993918">They thought about the question of arbitrability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.972" offset="11003009">It won't... it... it's all very likely that they wanted this whole thing to be arbitrable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.753" offset="11022130">And then they give you an example of where it is, where there is no contract, where there is nothing, where the parties never thought about arbitration, in all likelihood.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.390" offset="11060687">Now, with those examples, it seems to me that we're honing in on but we don't have yet an answer to the question Justice Ginsburg asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.348" offset="11104468">Well, if there's a contract and it's a thing they likely thought about and it's sort of a minor subsidiary thing and, after all, it's something that the arbitrator knows about and courts don't, that would all say it's not about arbitrability in the sense of requiring a special presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.877" offset="11178552">But if there's nothing at all in writing, if it's something courts know about, there is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.712" offset="11201957">All right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.462" offset="11204988">That's where I am.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.685" offset="11209794">That doesn't help you because I think in this case, yours would fall in the first category.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.602" offset="11225468">But, nonetheless, I'd appreciate a response because I... I need my thinking developed on this.</text>
