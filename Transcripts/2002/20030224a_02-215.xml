            <text syncTime="39.086" offset="302351">Second, it's unlikely in this case that the arbitrator would have found that the limitations on remedies agreed by the parties would have precluded the award of RICO treble damages, and third, there is simply no reason why parties found by the district court to be sophisticated cannot mutually agree to limit remedies.</text>

            <label>Mr. William E. Grauer</label>
            <text syncTime="3361.279" offset="13591050">Mr. Whatley's argument about $5 here and $10 there is flatly inconsistent with what the district judge found, and you can note at page A25 of our cert petition that the court found that these cases were negotiated by sophisticated groups of doctors, that the claims were not small, that in fact the doctors were enlarging an ongoing pattern... that's about midway through page A25 of our cert petition, that that is an ongoing pattern of instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.897" offset="13729603">Mr. Whatley's comment about the... the conspiracy claim has been certified and is going forward is exactly an example of the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.255" offset="13767010">Conspiracy is simply a remedy that's... that... a way of creating liability for an underlying cause of action, and the arbitration clauses in this case require the doctors to arbitrate all of their disputes with the managed care companies, and they're trying to circumvent that on a mass basis both in this appeal and by trying to say that the conspiracy claims are not part of the arbitration clause, and we don't think that's appropriate, and we think when we talk about remedies in our cert petition, that would include methods of holding someone liable for a claim, and the Court ought to take a look at that in the record of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.711" offset="13932836">But I would agree fundamentally with a point that I... I thought I heard Justice Souter making a moment ago, and that is that if Mr. Whatley's premise that any remedial limitation becomes a gateway issue of arbitrability, we are throwing... we are overruling Howsam after only a few weeks, because the whole point of Howsam was, you look to whether the parties made an agreement to arbitrate, and you look to whether the dispute is in the scope of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.825" offset="14053312">And here, at page A40 of our petition, the Court finds this is an exceptionally broad arbitration agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.588" offset="14080375">It includes any and all controversies, and the Court found that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.218" offset="14098870">That has never been appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.398" offset="14103572">Every... all of the claims are within the scope of it, and it is complete speculation to suggest that that, that any of these claims are not within the scope of the arbitration agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.730" offset="14144950">The... the... with re... a final point with reference to the intent of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.877" offset="14169505">The parties would intend an arbitrator to decide remedial limitations, and the reason why the parties would intend the arbitrator to decide that is because the parties have agreed to arbitrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.791" offset="14217152">They have a dispute in the scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.033" offset="14226138">They would never intend to go to court at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.916" offset="14233662">They would intend to go to arbitration and comply with their agreement, and the question of remedies would be the last thing that would come up in the event, on a speculative basis, that they prevail, and they ought not to be able to get away from that basic principle by labels, the label of punitive damages, the label of RICO, the label of conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.231" offset="14314955">Those labels are being used to take away the rights of managed care companies on a wholesale, nationwide basis to have these types of disputes resolved by arbitrators, as the parties have agreed, and instead they're trying to turn it into a nationwide class action.</text>
