            <text syncTime="311.099" offset="1389669">For example, a defendant, instead of challenging the, the order initially can, can half-way through trial decide he does not want any medication, and then the trial has to be postponed so that, so that the order to continue the medication can be appealed.</text>

            <text syncTime="937.896" offset="3896797">I take it you say, to follow the psychological association's standards, one, the court did consider whether any nondrug therapy could restore him to competence, and it answered the question, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.191" offset="3958028">The court did consider whether there was a substantial likelihood of success in restoring the defendant to competence, and they answered, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.291" offset="3994391">The court did consider whether the effectiveness of the drugs clearly outweighed the risk from side effects, and it said yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.268" offset="4022289">It also considered the effects of the Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights to fair trial, and decided they weren't enough to change the question, so it seems to me that once you concede all that, they're following the right standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.934" offset="4068996">So is your claim that we should go and review because they, although they purported to follow the right standards they didn't really do it, in other words, going to the facts of this case, or is your claim that those standards that your side's amicus says are the right ones, are not the right ones and, if so, what are?</text>

            <text syncTime="2806.297" offset="11370430">One of the arguments is that if you accept, for example, essentially your standard or the psychological association's standard, in applying it, you cannot apply it, as it were, in gross.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.520" offset="11423302">You've got to apply it with reference to the specific medication which is proposed, and that was not done in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.346" offset="11454649">I think the argument is, it's important because the effects of the various possible antipsychotic medications may vary tremendously.</text>

            <text syncTime="2859.798" offset="11584425">Now, Dr. Wolfson, the treating psychiatrist, or consulting psychiatrist at the hearing, testified that in his view there were two particular medications, quetiapine and olanzapine, which were likely to be the most suitable ones for Dr. Sell's case because of their very minimal side effect profile, that they would have a much better chance of not inducing sedation or other side effects that he might claim would interfere with the fairness of his trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.285" offset="11706364">But he explained that he did not want to be locked into a particular medication because one of his hopes, as the psychiatrist on the case, is that Dr. Sell would participate in choosing, if he had been told, he's ordered to take medication, which medication he wanted to take.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.567" offset="11775537">This is the kind of interactive process that doctors and patients have all the time, and for a court to superimpose some rigid rule up front that establishes this and only this medication can be administered is--</text>

            <text syncTime="3286.418" offset="13290952">There are, of course, organic problems that cannot be treatable at all, and there are other kinds of mental illness that can create this, but the statistics that the Bureau of Prisons furnished to us in considering this case shows that 80 percent of the individuals who are committed take these drugs voluntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.197" offset="13362005">Of the remaining 20 percent who did not, there's a very real indication that any sort of judicial relief has been sought through appellate review, and I think that's because these drugs enable someone who has serious psychotic orders to be restored to a point of rationality where they can make decisions about what they want to do with their life.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.575" offset="13447582">So instead of remaining incompetent and perhaps being committed indefinitely to a Bureau of Prisons facility, where they may be warehoused without any treatment, or being released if they are not subject to civil commitment, so that they don't stand trial on criminal charges and suffer essentially no consequences, most individuals accept the fact, particularly after an initial round of treatment has rendered them competent so that thy can understand the benefits of this, that the medication is the appropriate, medically sanctioned way to deal with the disease that they have.</text>
