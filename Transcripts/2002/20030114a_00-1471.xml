            <text syncTime="34.178" offset="281101">When Congress enacted ERISA, it created a Federal regulatory structure for employers and unions to sponsor plans that provide health care benefits for employees and their families.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.425" offset="326031">The vast majority of ERISA plans throughout the country have chosen to provide these benefits through HMO's or other managed care entities that use limited provider networks in order to deliver quality health care at a reasonable cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.312" offset="385590">The Kentucky laws before the Court today preclude that use of limited provider networks and require an HMO, and by using that term I mean to encompass a variety of managed care arrangements, require those arrangements to allow into the network any provider willing to accept the network terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.045" offset="460510">Because ERISA saves from preemption State laws which regulate insurance, the question here is whether these any willing provider, or AWP laws, regulate insurance.</text>

            <text syncTime="3140.219" offset="12705251">It talks about a regulation that homes in on the insurance industry, or is aimed at the insurance industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.168" offset="12729075">It is relevant how the State codified it because, as the Court said in... as recently as Rush, I think, the term insurance acquires its coloration and meaning from State law, State practice, and State usage, because what Congress was trying to do was preserve State law in an area of traditional State authority, and therefore, the codification in the Insurance Code is of relevance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.722" offset="12819249">And finally, at the very least, a State law that affects the contract between the insured and the insurer, which this one does, has a necessary effect on that contract and, in fact, a substantial one.</text>

            <text syncTime="3221.174" offset="13029065">I'll address four points, if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.679" offset="13039096">First, as to the argument that a condition is removed in the policy by operation of Kentucky law, that's not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.629" offset="13066890">Before and after the Kentucky law, the condition on getting payment from a... from a participating physician is identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.486" offset="13094371">All that's changed is that outside network.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.050" offset="13108581">The law, just so I'm clear, does not, by itself, require a network to admit a chiropractor when it has no chiropractic coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.369" offset="13141809">That's a different law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.648" offset="13146929">If it did that, we would say that definitely affects the legal rights of the insured and would be a mandated benefit law such as the Court sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.506" offset="13186426">Second point, we are not... a comment was made by counsel for the Commissioner about regulations of providers providing benefits to the insurers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.875" offset="13231879">Some do, and those... the line we would draw, say, if it's a regulation of a provider such as a continuity of care, such as a hold harmless provision that prevents the provider from billing for the balance above the network rate, that clearly affects the legal rights of the insured, and would be saved under our test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.508" offset="13302410">Third, Royal Drug, it's this Court's precedents that have said the Royal Drug analysis is directly relevant to the ERISA Savings Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.338" offset="13337728">It was the dissent in Royal Drug who said that pharmacy agreement is integral to the relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.260" offset="13361447">You can't have it without... you can't have the insurance without the pharmacy agreement, but that was said in the dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.120" offset="13388823">The Court rejected that view, and who is in the participating network is not part of the benefit of the insured.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.874" offset="13419857">The insured just has no right to decide what doctor to go to, or any legal right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.713" offset="13447233">To address... fourth and finally, to address perhaps more concisely the question of why do we care, if this isn't going to expand the networks, it's... it hurts us even if the network doesn't expand in the slightest because if nothing changes, if no choices or options are expanded, the uncertainty that has resulted is added to the administrative cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.080" offset="13548692">It's affected the ability to be selective.</text>
