            <text syncTime="3402.763" offset="13766326">In the first full paragraph, the court found approximately 95 percent of libraries with public Internet access have some form of acceptable use policy or Internet use policy governing patrons' use of the Internet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.822" offset="13838528">Now, what the libraries are saying here is the exercise of certain discretion violates the First Amendment rights of their patrons, and therefore every time they exercise that type of discretion in this context, they're subject to strict scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.285" offset="13908327">What this statute does is gives the libraries the right, if they choose to accept Federal funds, to make what kind of decisions, to exclude pornography which there's no dispute in the record libraries have, from time immemorial, chosen not to put in their libraries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.435" offset="13988994">So the decision that they're making is the same one they have already voluntarily made over the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.271" offset="14012295">It would inhibit their decisions to exclude e-mail, chat, gambling, dating services, and the other things that this part of the court below's decision held that they are doing already.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.541" offset="14069346">It's the traditional type of discretion that libraries have exercised with respect to whether they be... want to be a fiction library or a library that's specializing in this or that or technology or anything along those lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.366" offset="14128696">So the type of discretion that the librarians are saying violate their First Amendment rights are the types of discretion precisely that they've been exercising for years.</text>

            <text syncTime="3559.231" offset="14392115">It's in an area where the Government... the Congress of the United States and this Court has said the Government has a compelling governmental interest already.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.111" offset="14423671">It's a condition to the use of the funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.964" offset="14435060">This is not extracting from libraries some separate, unconnected decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.990" offset="14455227">It's connected with the actual use of the funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.894" offset="14466825">And it does not say that libraries may not stock pornography.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.353" offset="14488664">If they want to abandon the years of tradition of not stocking pornography on their bookshelves or in some other form, movies, whatever it might be, they can still do that without violating this condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.338" offset="14532549">So the libraries have plenty of choices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.746" offset="14542163">They can not accept the public money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.787" offset="14550417">They can accept the public money and use it in... in the way that Congress decided, which is consistent with their traditional exercise of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.029" offset="14587302">There's many distinguishing factors between this case and the cases in... in which the Court has exercised... expressed some concern with respect to the First Amendment issues here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.933" offset="14634949">It is not... this case is not a regulation of speech, but the actions of a Government acting in a proprietary capacity... a library to make its own decisions, deciding what to subsidize, what speech to have in that library, what speech not to have in that library.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.377" offset="14696703">The Government is merely... is making a content decision, not a viewpoint decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.150" offset="14719795">There's no contention that there's a viewpoint decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.330" offset="14728572">The type of decision that they say is being forced upon them, which is actually voluntary, is the same type of decision that libraries... librarians customarily make.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.150" offset="14767860">The Federal statute and the library policy that they're complaining about expands information, it doesn't contract information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.453" offset="14797013">And this Court said in the Arkansas Educational Television case, a jurisprudence that would result in the constriction of speech, rather than the expansion of speech, would be a repression of First Amendment rights.</text>
