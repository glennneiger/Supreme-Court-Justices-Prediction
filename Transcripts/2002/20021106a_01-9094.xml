            <text syncTime="3471.356" offset="14035159">I would like to direct the Court's attention to pages 12 and 13 of our reply brief, the yellow brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.220" offset="14074656">On those pages, in the footnote in the text there are a number of cases that are cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.050" offset="14093986">Every single one of those cases is a 60(b) case in a habeas or 2255 situation where 60(b) was granted, relief was granted and it was determined that this was not a second or successive petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.153" offset="14146336">In each one of those cases, the reason was mistake of law, the U.S. Supreme Court or some other court came down with a new decision, and in every one of those cases, that issue was not raised on direct appeal to the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.317" offset="14211015">It came back on a 60(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.069" offset="14218016">In each case they had to adjudicate the question of whether it was reasonable for them not to have raised it in the court of appeals at that time, and in each case they did on the ground that the new decision that came down changed everything, and it suddenly made what looked like a frivolous claim at that time into what was not a frivolous claim, but, indeed, one on which there was at least a right to adjudication on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.552" offset="14323968">In some cases they won, in some they lost when they went to the merits after they got their 60(b) relief, but the fact is that those cases, including this Court's GVR in Blackmon v. Money, which was a 60(b) case on a successive, or a second, not a successive but a second habeas petition, were cases where they had not been raised on appeal, but they... they were determined to be at least potentially ones where there was a reasonable basis for not having done it, and frivolousness, not making frivolous claims is such a basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.870" offset="14473284">This Court in Gomez and other cases has been particularly emphatic that habeas petitioners should not... especially in capital cases... should not be raising frivolous claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.471" offset="14519678">The second thing I want to point to is that the 2244(b)(3)(E), which says that there is no... it not only says the Supreme Court can't take a cert petition, it says that rehearing petitions can't be held in the court of appeals, but the court of appeals are unanimous in saying, if the question is whether this is a second or successive petition, that can be reheard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.793" offset="14612987">That's not governed by 2244(b)(3)(E).</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.335" offset="14631064">We can separate that question out, and we can decide that, and it's exactly the same thing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.158" offset="14654365">The key case there is Mancuso in the Second Circuit, 166 F. 3d 97, so the courts have been separating out those questions, saying if it's a question of jurisdiction--</text>
