            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="319971">Mr. Burchfield, we'll hear your rebuttal.</text>

            <label>Mr. Bobby R. Burchfield</label>
            <text syncTime="6.646" offset="346511">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.141" offset="360513">Time permitting, I'd like to make three brief points.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.850" offset="371275">The first is Section 323(a), the across-the-board criminal prohibition on national parties can be well contrasted with Section 323(e), which addresses Federal officeholder solicitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.042" offset="436059">In 323(e)(1)(B), there is a specific allowance for Federal officeholders to raise non-Federal money up to the analogous Federal limit for state and local candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.651" offset="510560">There is no similar allowance for national party officials, and the conclusion that all of my clients have reached is that national party officials are unable to raise non-Federal money, even up to the analogous Federal limit if it goes into a state party, a state candidate's campaign account because that account is not regulated by Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.341" offset="609303">Number two, and to go to Justice O'Connor's question, the potential effect of corruption, the potential corruptive effect of such donations is minuscule, nonexistent, attenuated at best, in the words of Colorado I.  The $15.6 million, by the way, that the RNC spent in state and local election activity in 2001 was 30 percent of the non-Federal money the party raised that year, 30 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.183" offset="744618">It's not an insubstantial amount in any, to any degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.048" offset="756111">Second point, with regard to Section 323(b), which is the restrictions on state parties, the corruptive potential of donations to state and local parties for use in Get Out the Vote activities directed to state and local candidate elections is again minuscule, at best attenuated, in the words of Colorado I.  But that activity, if it says go to the polls on November 8th, is swept within the definition of Federal election activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.842" offset="883275">The California parties send out hundreds of different mailings every year throughout their states urging voters to go to the polls and those mailings mention only state and local candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.795" offset="931132">That activity is swept within the definition of Federal election activity and is now federally regulated activity and that, in that respect 323(b) goes well beyond a congressional interest in eliminating corruption of Federal candidates and officeholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.075" offset="1004170">Final point, and that is with regard to Section 213.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.115" offset="1020366">The only illusion to that was with regard to the coordination of activities among the national parties and, and the candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.626" offset="1054430">213 addresses two different uses of Federal money, hard money.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.059" offset="1084105">It puts the parties to a single unified irrevocable choice to make coordinated expenditures under the statute, Section 441a(d) or their constitutional right to make independent expenditures recognized by this Court in Colorado I.  The Government, and this is very important, the Government has never advanced any anti-corruption rationale to put the parties to that choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.673" offset="1194655">The only rationale we've gotten is Congress can condition the statutory right simply because it's Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.459" offset="1225793">There is no suggestion that using hard money for I is more corrupting or is corrupting in any way than using hard money for the other.</text>

            <text syncTime="247.659" offset="1310534">As we turn from Title I to Title II, we turn to efforts by Congress to limit, to regulate, and ultimately to punish what are only expenditures, expenditures not made in coordination with parties or candidates which would result in them being treated as contributions, but independently, and so we deal here this afternoon in an area which as this Court observed in Colorado II, it has routinely struck down expend... any limitations in this area.</text>

            <text syncTime="286.669" offset="1466642">There is no dispute about that, and I think we're all agreed that this is a content-based restriction on speech, whether we're agreed or not, it is a content-based restriction on speech.</text>

            <text syncTime="2597.945" offset="10711690">For example, three AFL-CIO ads that ran in quick succession in September 1998 denied, in Barker and Spearmint, all addressed legislation that the Republican majority on issues of grave concerns to the AFL-CIO had hastily scheduled, and we came up, we devised ads in a few days' notice and broadcast ads in a number of states in order to pressure particular Members of Congress in the Senate and the House on how they should vote on that legislation on a vote that was actually taking place five days later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.852" offset="10835302">It was pure happenstance that that vote occurred in September of 1998 rather than say September of 1999, when this prescription would not have been upon us.</text>

            <text syncTime="2702.170" offset="11128604">And the only case where this Court has ever approved an actual restriction on express advocacy, the two interests identified there are the two aspects of the entity there, mainly aggregation of wealth... or the immense aggregation of wealth by virtue of the corporate forum, not aggregation of wealth alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.577" offset="11198195">And whether or not the spending reflected the views of members or shareholders this Court pointed out were inapplicable to unions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3507.662" offset="14350547">Justice Breyer, two things are wrong with that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.081" offset="14360265">First, the First Amendment rights of speech and association are not somehow contingent upon, dependent upon exercise of the right to vote under the 26th.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.935" offset="14395687">Secondly... and a perfect example of that would be prior to the passage of the 19th Amendment, women were denied the right to vote in the United States but they certainly could still exercise the rights of speech and association to obtain the right of suffrage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.198" offset="14452738">And I think it would be exactly the same argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.239" offset="14460889">Also, in fact, in 11 states, 17 year olds actually can vote in primaries so long as they reach the age of 18 by the next general election.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.620" offset="14502371">So there are states in which in fact it can be that the 17 year old can vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.754" offset="14518985">But that I think also proves up the problem here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.006" offset="14527971">And that is, if the government's justification for the prohibition... and here this absolute prohibition... is in fact that there is a concern over conduit giving, the existing regulations and existing law, 441(a) and (f), prohibit excess or contributions given in the name of another, a conduit gift.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.187" offset="14612712">That is absolutely prohibited.</text>

            <text syncTime="3579.445" offset="14637685">And of course, 441(a) prohibits gifts in excess of the contribution limits.</text>

            <text syncTime="4748.197" offset="19312663">Now, the reason I find that so surprising is there was a direct challenge to those solicitation requirements before this Court in the National Right to Work Committee case.</text>

            <text syncTime="4893.949" offset="19895716">This Court has approved the same basic mechanism in the context of express advocacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4898.948" offset="19915674">It has worked well perhaps not with the definition of express advocacy, but has worked well in terms of the separate segregated fund requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4906.555" offset="19946185">The other point I think that has to be made about the separate segregated fund requirement is that the idea that, okay, let's say that we now have meaningful limits so there are going to be some real incentives to put some money in your political action committee or your separate segregated fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="4920.809" offset="20003132">One of two things can happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="4922.628" offset="20010446">With some organizations, it may very well turn out that some of the people who were members of the overall organization, turns out they really weren't 100 percent interested in supporting the political causes of that organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="4934.370" offset="20057362">They sort of like some of the other benefits of membership.</text>

            <text syncTime="4940.085" offset="20080245">In some other organizations, it may be that every member of the organization supports the political cause and they give the money to the separate segregated fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="4947.519" offset="20110025">In either event, the purposes of the separate segregated fund are fully vindicated because the resulting corporate political activity at that point will reflect the views of the underlying membership and the underlying union members, which is precisely what this Court said was a compelling interest in Austin.</text>
