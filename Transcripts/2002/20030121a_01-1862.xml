            <text syncTime="14.762" offset="201804">In Lindh versus Murphy, this Court held that chapter 153 was non-retroactive to cases pending at the time of AEDPA's enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.272" offset="235763">In the general run of habeas cases, this is determined by the filing date of the application for habeas relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.790" offset="261885">This case will resolve a split between the five circuits that apply this rule to capital cases and the Ninth Circuit which, instead, looks to the date the pre-application motion for counsel was filed in a capital case.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.485" offset="316638">We believe that the five circuits are correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.114" offset="327191">Neither chapter 153 nor Lindh versus Murphy identifies the commencement event that triggers the application of chapter 153.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.233" offset="367629">In light of this, we must determine Congress' intent, and the first place to look is to the express terms of chapter 153 and, of course, AEDPA's purposes to expedite habeas cases and to provide greater deferential review to State... State criminal convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.400" offset="448295">Chapter 153 by its terms can only apply to a merits petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.172" offset="471387">It repeatedly contains express language, such as that contained in 2244(d), which is found at petitioner's appendix 185, which concerns the statute of limitations provisions and provides that the statute of limitations applies to the application for habeas relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="128.491" offset="656648">The first phase is the pre-application phase, which is what McFarland was concerned about.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.208" offset="675560">In that case, this Court was concerned about providing, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 848... concerned about the pre-application grant of counsel to habeas petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.916" offset="730418">But that is entirely separable from the merits proceeding that occurs after the filing of the... of the petition itself which brings the merits before the court.</text>

That... we only come to that term at all because in this Court's opinion in Lindh, the Court looked to... created a... viewed the... as being a negative inference from the absence of the pending cases language that appears in the 154 provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.192" offset="883495">The 153 provisions do not have that... those... that term in them.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.840" offset="910036">Instead, they use the specific express words of an application.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.381" offset="924246">They clearly apply to an application.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.133" offset="931247">And the case... that's reconcilable because the portion of the case that we're talking about is the merits portion of the... of the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="867.944" offset="3614440">The issue is not whether this harms Mr. Garceau, but whether it is appropriate under this Court's precedent to rule the way the State asked this Court to rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.469" offset="3652579">For two independent reasons, the amendments to chapter 153 do not apply to Mr. Garceau.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.602" offset="3677134">First, it simply cannot be, as the State suggests, that after this Court found in McFarland that a capital case is commenced by the filing of a motion for counsel, that Congress then passed a new statute, intending it to be interpreted consistent with the dissent in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.584" offset="3745053">Congress must be presumed to have been informed by this Court's majority ruling in McFarland.</text>

            <text syncTime="915.889" offset="3806284">That ruling was only 2 years before Congress made major revisions to the habeas corpus law in AEDPA.</text>

            <text syncTime="957.854" offset="3974094">And I think once that is done, this Court will conclude that if you interpret the ruling in Lindh, where... where 107(c) applies to 153 and 154... where did Congress get the word case when they were determining who would be subject to this law?</text>
            <text syncTime="975.565" offset="4044938">And I agree with Justice Ginsburg that when a case is begun, you get a number, you're put on a docket.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.463" offset="4076599">That is your case, and that is consistent with what this Court decided in McFarland.</text>

            <label>Ms. Lynne S. Coffin</label>
            <text syncTime="2277.849" offset="9254068">Well, there were a number of reasons for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.594" offset="9261069">The first is that in State court, they... there was neither discovery nor any evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.086" offset="9291058">There was no mechanism... there was very little money and there was no mechanism by which counsel could pull together an entire petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.502" offset="9332749">And the district court agreed with that by giving counsel funds in Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.815" offset="9353960">However, the district court set forth a schedule by which funds would be... would be given, and those funds... you did some investigation, you got... you satisfied the district court, you got more funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.058" offset="9414983">The last funds were not... were not given to counsel until, I believe, the end of May, which was only about 4 weeks before the petition was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.594" offset="9449046">So that's one reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.672" offset="9453435">The other reason is that counsel had to make a determination, under this Court's precedent, whether or not it would be a mistake not to file a full petition, the best petition that could possibly be made and because it would be possible that it might not have been able to be amended.</text>

            <text syncTime="2377.774" offset="9653846">But the effect of our holding that... that the habeas action for purposes of AEDPA commences with the... the initial request for counsel is that all... all of the transactions... I mean, if... if that provision that all factual determinations by the State court must be deemed to be correct, that means that AEDPA would, in the future, apply to those... to those determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.939" offset="9770457">Whereas, if we came out the other way, until the habeas application is... is applied, the strictures of AEDPA don't... are... are not applicable.</text>
