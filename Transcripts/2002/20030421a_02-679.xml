            <text syncTime="61.284" offset="378390">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="66.265" offset="398243">This case involves the extraordinary situation in the law where the burden of proof is shifted to a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.762" offset="428232">Courts have recognized this type of burden shift in certain limited situations, certain torts, and in 1989 this Court recognized that burden shift in Title VII cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.846" offset="476610">We are here today because the court below has held and the respondent argues that the Civil Rights Act Amendment of 1991 shifts the burden of proof to the defendant in virtually all Title VII disparate treatment cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.317" offset="534498">That conclusion does not follow from the text of the Civil Rights Act, nor does it make sense based on this Court's history of fashioning the orderly presentation of proof in Title VII cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.547" offset="579428">The Civil Rights Act of 1991 was passed in part as a response to certain decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.641" offset="611820">One of those decisions was Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins where the Court recognized that in certain limited situations in a Title VII disparate treatment case, when the plaintiff presents direct evidence of an unlawful motive that was actually relied upon in making a decision, the burden of causation then shifts to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.599" offset="703562">The Price Waterhouse mixed-motive framework applies to a narrow subset of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.748" offset="728222">The Court recognized early on in Title VII that most of these cases will be circumstantial evidence cases, and as a way to deal with that, the McDonnell Douglas case set up a framework for considering the vast majority of those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.542" offset="795409">In the few cases where there is direct evidence of illegal animus tied to an employment decision, the Court said that the defendant must now prove that it would have made the same decision either way.</text>

            <text syncTime="185.600" offset="875657">There's two definitions that we've briefed, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.795" offset="900421">Both of them I think are helpful.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.510" offset="915259">The first one is quoted in the SG's brief at page 26, and that's from the EEOC guidance.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.101" offset="945561">And I'll read that.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.839" offset="956532">Any written or verbal policy or statement made by a respondent or a respondent official that on its face demonstrates a bias against a protected group and is linked to the complained-of adverse action.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.134" offset="1013793">We proposed, Your Honor, in our blue brief a slightly different formulation, but I believe it gets you to the same place.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.388" offset="1042736">On page 41 of our blue brief, borrowing from the First Circuit Febres case, a three-part test which we think gets you to the same place.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.609" offset="1083592">The first is there has to be a statement by a decisionmaker; second, that directly reflects the alleged animus; and third, that it bears squarely on the contested employment decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="258.659" offset="1167810">As I understand the EEOC guideline, it doesn't require that... that the indication come from a decisionmaker.</text>

            <text syncTime="308.208" offset="1366028">It sets out 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(m), which was 107(a) of the Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.488" offset="1395180">And that described that an unlawful employment practice would be established when the complaining party demonstrates that race, color, religion, sex, or national origin was a motivating factor for any employment practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.390" offset="1446798">And then this is the key language: even though other factors also motivated the practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.776" offset="1464353">This indicates that Congress intended for there to be the distinction, recognized in Price Waterhouse, between the standard McDonnell Douglas pretext case, which you prove under 2000e-2(a), and the mixed-motive case which was first recognized in Price Waterhouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.169" offset="1541884">The second part of the text that evidences this distinction is section 107(b) of the Civil Rights Act which is codified there in that same place at 2000e-5(g)(2)(B), and that talks about where an individual proves a violation under 2(m) that... and where the employer does not succeed in proving... excuse me... where the employer does succeed in proving the affirmative defense, then in that case the plaintiff is entitled only to declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and attorneys' fees demonstrated to be directly attributable only to the pursuit of a claim under section 2000e-2(m).</text>

            <text syncTime="424.580" offset="1831530">And the reason I say that is because in order to interpret the burdens of proof, this Court historically looks at background principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.503" offset="1867265">And when we look at this statute, using the Court's background principles of McDonnell Douglas for the standard pretext case and Price Waterhouse for the standard mixed-motive case, there's no heightened evidentiary standard for the respondent or the employer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1764.049" offset="7189453">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.449" offset="7226965">This case, at the very middle of it, when we're trying to settle instructions, the parties involved agreed to instructions 1 through 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.563" offset="7279419">Instruction number 9 to the jury was, in fact, the 107(a) instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.544" offset="7319334">It read... and this jury instruction is found at the joint appendix 32 and 33.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.501" offset="7355174">It read, the plaintiff has the burden of proving each of the following by a preponderance of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.402" offset="7394775">One, Costa suffered adverse work conditions, and two, Costa's gender was a motivating factor in any such work conditions imposed upon her.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.029" offset="7441273">Gender refers to the quality of being male or female.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.308" offset="7454439">If you find that each of these things has been proved against a defendant, your verdict should be for the plaintiff and against the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.953" offset="7485055">On the other hand, if any of these things has not been proved against a defendant, your verdict should be for the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.469" offset="7515043">What I'm trying to point out is the parties at that point and at that juncture had agreed that this definitely was a 107(a) case and it would go to the jury as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.465" offset="7571050">The only objection that Caesars had to instructions was instruction number 10, and instruction number 10 was the same action defense that aids Caesars in the fact that it actually cuts down the type of damages that can be awarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.742" offset="7652134">In fact, monetary damages cannot be awarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.459" offset="7663001">That instruction aided Caesars and in no event is it easy for them to now come before this Court and say they were harmed by the fact that that instruction was given.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.303" offset="7722455">I would point out that this is similar to the Reeves case, and the reason that it is similar is in Reeves, the parties in that case had basically agreed that the McDonnell Douglas framework would be used, and this Court said since that seems to be the position of the parties, we'll accept that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.871" offset="7816705">Well, I would submit that the same thing occurred in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.508" offset="7839275">The parties agreed that this is a 107(a) case, and that's... that's the way it was presented to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.541" offset="7867383">Reading 703(m), which is Title VII 200e-2(m)... and that's found at the respondent's brief, page 9... the section specifically states, except as otherwise provided in this title, an unlawful employment practice is established when a complaining party demonstrates a race, color, religion, sex, or national origin was a motivating factor for any employment practice, even though other factors also motivated the practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.255" offset="8038224">That's stating any employment practice that... that takes into consideration any of the things listed, and in this case, it was gender.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.609" offset="8087647">So it was a gender-motivated case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.921" offset="8100917">I would point out that when we look at this statute, it talks in terms of a plaintiff having to demonstrate, and the plaintiff under that terminology merely had to show and bear the burden of showing a case which actually would indicate that gender was a motivating factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.555" offset="8223379">In the case that was presented to the jury, there was absolutely no question that Ms. Costa showed a case every bit as strong as the case and the facts that were found in Price Waterhouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.403" offset="8286805">Reference does not have to be made to Price Waterhouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.009" offset="8309270">The statute itself does not talk in terms of any heightened burden placed on the plaintiff, nor does it talk in terms of substantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.300" offset="8350439">It goes right to what it says on its face that a plaintiff merely has to demonstrate.</text>
