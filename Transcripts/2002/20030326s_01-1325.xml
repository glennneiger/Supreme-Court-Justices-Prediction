            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="9.749" offset="124328">In the course of their legal practice, attorneys are frequently required to hold clients funds various lengths of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.810" offset="156511">They have a professional obligation to avoid commingling their client's money with their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.442" offset="179080">But it is not unethical to pull several client's fund in a single trust account.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.664" offset="203949">Before 1980, client funds were typically held in non-interest bearing federal insured checking accounts, but because the federal banking regulations in effect since the great depression prohibited banks from paying interests on checking accounts the value of the use of the client's money in such accounts innured to the banking institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.426" offset="287018">In 1980 Congress authorized federally insured banks to pay interest on a limited category of demand deposit referred to as NOW accounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.335" offset="326620">This category includes deposits made by individuals and charitable organizations but does include those made by for profit corporations or partnerships, unless the deposits are made pursuant to a program under which charitable organizations have the inclusive right to the interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.918" offset="401017">In response to the change in federal law, every State in the Nation has adapted a so-called IOLTA program.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.148" offset="429856">IOLTA is an acronym for Interest On Lawyers Trust Accounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.520" offset="455351">Authorizing the use of NOW accounts for the deposit of client funds and providing that all the interest on such accounts be used for charitable purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.461" offset="495162">This case presents a challenge to the constitutionality of the IOLTA program adopted by the State of Washington Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.138" offset="533823">An important feature of that program is that it categorically prohibits deposits of client funds into IOLTA accounts if those funds could produce net interest for the client.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.626" offset="583769">The two petitioners in this case are individuals who regularly purchase and sell real estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.496" offset="607280">One of them made an excrow deposit of about $15,000 that was placed in an IOLTA account for two weeks and the other made a $90,000.00 excrow payment that was held in an IOLTA account for two days.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.395" offset="662868">The parties assumed that the first deposit generated some interest and that the second earned $4.96, but neither petitioner claimed that he could have earned any net interest in a non-IOLTA account, or that the interest earned on his deposit in the IOLTA account actually exceeded the bank charges and other transaction cost that would have been incurred in an attempt to remit any net interest to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.279" offset="774463">After discovery, the District Court granted the defendant's motions for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.352" offset="794734">As a matter of fact, it concluded that in no event can the client depositors make any net returns on the interest acrued in this accounts, and as a matter of law, it concluded that constitutional issue focuses on what the owner has lost not what the government has gained.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.169" offset="869967">Since petitioners had lost nothing there had been no taking without just compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.771" offset="892432">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit sitting en banc affirm and we granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.747" offset="920331">Like all of the other judges who have participated in this case, we agree with the proposition that just compensation required by the taking clause of the Fifth Amendment is measured by the property owners loss rather by the government's gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.603" offset="983756">Petitioners' loss under Washingtonâ€™s IOLTA rules was zero.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.332" offset="1002669">As a matter of constitutional law the just compensation that is due for a net loss of zero is zero.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.625" offset="1031822">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.229" offset="1046241">Justice Scalia has filed the dissenting opinion that has joined by the Chief Justice, Justice Kennedy and Justice Thomas; Justice Kennedy has also filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
