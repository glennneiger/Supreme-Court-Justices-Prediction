            <text syncTime="1072.231" offset="4435623">Respondents challenge only the delay caused by the city charter's neutral, longstanding provisions facilitating the orderly processing of citizen-initiated referenda to review ordinances passed by the city council.</text>

            <text syncTime="1094.822" offset="4526007">In this case, that balance is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.281" offset="4535829">The city's actions in giving effect to the properly filed referendum petition cannot give rise to liability under the Fair Housing Act or the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.664" offset="4573341">It is undisputed that the referendum petition was facially neutral and that numerous reasonable, non-racial grounds supported it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.075" offset="4606986">It is also undisputed that the city's process for handling such petitions was longstanding and race-neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.309" offset="4635930">Under any conceivable standard, respondents have failed to provide any evidence that the referendum process was tainted with discriminatory motive either on the part of the city officials or the petition organizers.</text>

            <text syncTime="3503.584" offset="14161011">With respect to the disparate impact claim, I would just like to clarify that we were the petitioners, and the Court did grant certiorari on the issue and there is a judgment of the Sixth Circuit against my clients on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.008" offset="14206673">And while they've abandoned the claim and declined to defend the Sixth Circuit's judgment, we would request the Court vacate that judgment and instruct that the disparate impact claim be dismissed with prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.963" offset="14246484">With... Justice Breyer, with respect to your questions to my opposing counsel, a point we'd like to add to what you had to say is simply that if we had done what they wanted, we would have been subjected to a damages claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.755" offset="14297684">It would have been a First Amendment claim by the citizens seeking to put something on the ballot by initiating a petition, and it... it can't be that in order to avoid a Fourteenth Amendment damages claim, we have to violate other people's First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.076" offset="14354944">If the Court doesn't have any further questions, we have nothing further.</text>
