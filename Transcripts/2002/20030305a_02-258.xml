            <text syncTime="57.370" offset="366166">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="60.390" offset="378182">In enacting section 1367, Congress took up this Court's invitation in Finley to manage the boundaries of supplemental jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.110" offset="421127">It had two goals in doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.330" offset="430009">It sought to provide a Federal forum for the plaintiffs that so chose to use it, and for... for reasons of respect for the interests of comity and federalism, it provided a mechanism by which those cases may be returned to State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.530" offset="494793">They knew that there was a dilemma, a dilemma caused by the operation of statutes of limitations, and so they sought to find and found a simple, practical, workable solution that traveled down a well-trod path.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.621" offset="559158">It's a path that was traveled down by the Soldier and Sailors' Relief Act, a act that also tolls State statutes of limitations even when exigent circumstances do not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.201" offset="609418">And in the case in 1993 holding that, Conroy, this Court found that it was applicable in that instance to a defendant who was a town.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.251" offset="649646">It also traveled down that road in section 108 of the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.431" offset="674410">This too provides that kind of 30-day window after dismissal of the automatic stay or lifting of the automatic stay for a plaintiff to file an action which is otherwise purely a State matter in State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.521" offset="734701">This Court found in Stewart v. Kahn that there is no federalism bar to congressional authority as long as that authority exists someplace in the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.031" offset="780781">Throughout its history, pursuant to Article I, which has a cognate provision duplicative of the authority it derives also from Article III, Congress has used its jurisdiction-setting authority as a traffic cop over the area of concurrent State and Federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.621" offset="863119">It has done so almost from the beginning in the Anti-Injunction Act, the removal statute, and has always found this to be a necessary incident of maintaining a dual-court system.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="195.141" offset="917245">Well, the Anti-Injunction Act just applies to Federal courts, doesn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="207.251" offset="965624">It's an... that... that's an exception to the Anti-Injunction Act.</text>

          <turn speaker="robert_s_peck" startTime="211.411" stopTime="300.433">
            <label>Mr. Robert S. Peck</label>
            <text syncTime="211.411" offset="982342">That's an exception contained in the Anti-Injunction Act, and another exception is when an act of Congress so provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.971" offset="1004494">The choice of tolling did not attempt to give longer life in State court than it would have enjoyed in Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.111" offset="1041065">It did not eliminate defenses that were available in Federal court, have the matter remain there.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.111" offset="1065098">It did not change the State's policy on waiver of municipal liability or alter its statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.671" offset="1091325">It simply said that the case, as it stood in Federal court, is now available to be heard in State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.061" offset="1120895">The State is free to change both its waiver of immunity, its statute of limitations, and Congress accepts those changes regardless of the application of the supplemental jurisdiction statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.151" offset="1173245">Once that jurisdiction attaches, once the Federal court has authority to hear the State action, then even after the Federal... Federal claim has fallen away, the court still has the jurisdiction to hear what otherwise would have been a purely State claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.651" offset="1251299">This is unusual in a diversity case.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.751" offset="1263628">When complete diversity is broken, the jurisdiction ends.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.881" offset="1276167">But here no one, not the Supreme Court of South Carolina, not the respondents, not the amici, questioned Congress' authority to say that this remains a Federal matter because a Federal interest has attached because the matter has now been heard.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="300.433" offset="1338339">I didn't understand it that way, but South Carolina said, Federal court, you want to take this and deal with this stale claim?</text>
            <text syncTime="306.493" offset="1362580">That's all right with us.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.640" offset="1367178">It's one of the ironies of the case that the State's position is the Federal court can have it if you keep it.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.292" offset="1389852">The only thing they can't do is give it back to us when we don't want it because that would be commandeering the use of our courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.197" offset="1421408">South Carolina's position is the Federal court can keep our State claim in Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.464" offset="1446486">Indeed, it must if it wants the claim to remain alive.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert S. Peck</label>
            <text syncTime="330.600" offset="1459024">That... that is correct, and even at this late date, rule 60(b) would enable a plaintiff like Susan Jinks to seek to reopen that Federal case, to... to reconsider its judgment and allow this case to still live if... if the tolling provision is ineffective.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.875" offset="1528197">So here what we're saying is that there's a continuing Federal interest in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.703" offset="1551498">There's... there's been a Federal attachment to what otherwise would have been a purely State matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.522" offset="1574695">In a removal situation, for example, South Carolina could not refuse a remand and we contend that that authority which is contained in the removal statute is the same kind of authority that Congress is exercising here because what Congress has effectively done is define the legal effect of the appearance of this matter in Federal court and the Federal disposition of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.383" offset="1670198">And the State courts of South Carolina or any other State is not equipped, it's not authorized to refuse that definition because Congress is the supreme sovereign of Federal law.</text>

            <text syncTime="991.334" offset="4101989">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.448" offset="4154443">The tolling provision at issue here is within Congress' constitutional powers for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.212" offset="4177535">First, it establishes the legal effect of a distinctly Federal set of events: the filing, pendency, and dismissal of an action in Federal court over a defendant over whom the court can exercise jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.581" offset="4230930">Second, it serves legitimate Federal interests, ensuring that if plaintiffs are held harmless for having selected a Federal forum in the first instance and ensuring that Federal courts are not required to exercise jurisdiction and decide cases that involve potentially sensitive issues of State law that are more reliably and more appropriately decided in the State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.065" offset="4308879">Because municipalities are not States or arms of the States, sovereign immunity does not prevent them from being hailed into Federal court and it doesn't prevent the Federal courts from exercising jurisdiction over cases against them, including supplemental State law claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.286" offset="4365826">Congress can establish the rules for when Federal courts should hear such claims and the rules for when they should not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.227" offset="4389545">Congress has corresponding authority to establish reasonable rules about the legal consequences of the pendency of the Federal action, of the filing of the claim, its pendency, and the court's decision to dismiss it under specified rules that Congress itself has established.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.999" offset="4444611">The rule established here falls within the tradition of Federal control over the effect of Federal proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.873" offset="4472197">It falls in the tradition of, for example, legal effect of the filing of a bankruptcy petition which stays all the actions that are against the debtor and tolls the State limitations periods during the pendency of the automatic stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.410" offset="4518277">Or the removal provision which takes cases out of State courts, stays the proceedings in State courts, and thus prevents the State courts from proceeding in a way such as by deeming the case constructively dismissed that might have the effect of causing the statute of limitations to continue to run.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.894" offset="4576268">And the effect of a Federal... a judgment of a Federal court case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.478" offset="4590584">All these are matters that are controlled by Federal law, and that Federal law is no less binding on State courts adjudicating State causes of action, including against municipalities, than they are on Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.944" offset="4636455">The rule in this case serves twin Federal interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.326" offset="4654009">First, it holds plaintiffs harmless for having selected a forum... a State... excuse me... a Federal rather than a State forum in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.992" offset="4680654">Absent this sort of rule, plaintiffs would face the risk, if they chose a Federal forum, of having the statute of limitations run on their State law claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.353" offset="4710015">If the Federal court then chose to dismiss, those State law claims would be barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.374" offset="4730182">And plaintiffs would have an artificial incentive to avoid Federal court, including for the assertion of their Federal law claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.122" offset="4753170">It also serves the interests of Federal courts in ensuring that they don't have to decide State law claims that are potentially sensitive, that under the standards this Court articulated in Gibbs that Congress has codified in section 1367(c) and it reflects sensible notions of division between State and Federal authority more appropriately belong in State court and can be more reliably adjudicated there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.666" offset="4839269">This Court's decision in Stewart v. Kahn establishes that there is no constitutional impediment to congressional preemption of State tolling rules if it serves a legitimate Federal interest, the tolling provision here, like the social... excuse me... like the Soldiers' and Sailors' Relief Act, the bankruptcy automatic stay tolling rule, following that tradition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.748" offset="4919622">Finally, the tolling rule here intrudes only modestly on State interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.386" offset="4938221">The timely filing of the State claims in Federal court serves all of the statute of limitations purposes as the claim... as the timely filing of those same claims in State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.144" offset="4973225">Accordingly, we ask that the judgment of the State supreme court be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.966" offset="4992556">If there are no further questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2765.104" offset="11197055">So if the Federal judge keeps this case in deference to South Carolina's position that it doesn't want it, it's too late, and the Federal court in a diversity case must apply the State statute of limitations, when... when does that limitation begin, when South Carolina said it would if the case were reinstituted there?</text>

I would submit that the statute of limitations started to... or ran from obviously the date of loss through... through for the two-year period, and if the case was filed in Federal court within that two-year period, the statute of limitations, as well as the... the argument that sovereign immunity applies, would not be applicable to that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.599" offset="11399034">But what occurred in this case is there was a dismissal without prejudice of the State law claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.186" offset="11421395">Under South Carolina law, a dismissal with prejudice is treated as if the suit was never brought in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.966" offset="11448562">And as a result, when the case was refiled in the State court, it was refiled beyond the two years, at which point the statute of limitations had run and at which point Richland County was also entitled to absolute immunity under the South Carolina Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.499" offset="11510629">And I would again submit to the Court that the reason why we believe that this is a significant issue under the Tenth Amendment for this case and why the Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence of this Court does not govern is... is because of the importance of the State law interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.756" offset="11587638">And the key to this whole argument is the point that this is not a Federal claim litigated in Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.746" offset="11615642">In fact, the cases that have been cited by the petitioner in their briefs, the Burnett case, the Order of Railroad Engineers case, all of those cases are distinguishable because those are Federal causes of action that are litigated in Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.846" offset="11672066">This is a State law claim that's litigated in State court under purely State law, and we would submit that the South Carolina General Assembly should decide what is the applicable South Carolina law and that Congress does not have the power under Article III and the Necessary and Proper Clause to override that statement of State law and to create liability where no liability previously existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.696" offset="11771436">And that is the key point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.810" offset="11779899">Congress has the authority through a validly enacted statute and through use of the Supremacy Clause to limit liability in State actions by providing for preemption, ERISA being an example, but there is no example that I'm aware of where Congress has created liability where none previously existed.</text>
