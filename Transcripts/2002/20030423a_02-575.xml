            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="159182">We'll hear argument now in Number 02-575, Nike, Inc. versus Marc Kasky.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.251" offset="196171">Mr. Tribe.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="laurence_h_tribe" startTime="56.603" stopTime="279.446">
            <label>Mr. Laurence H. Tribe</label>
            <text syncTime="56.603" offset="385507">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="60.134" offset="399718">In the mid-1990s there was, of course, an intense debate on the pros and cons of globalization, and of the impact of companies like Nike on workers in the Third World, where Nike contracted out much of its production to some 900 factories in 51 countries with over 600,000 employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.479" offset="493027">Now, the critics, many from pro-labor groups, denounced Nike as the chief exemplar of the evils of globalization, arguing that Nike was simply shifting production to places where it could exploit the workforce and act in ways that were illegal and immoral, and the critics took much of their documentation from the media.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.716" offset="577977">Of course, Nike disagreed, using the same media venues as the critics had used to document what it thought were the connections between its presence and activities in countries like South Korea and Vietnam and the development of technological expertise in those countries, as well as the expansion of job opportunities there, and also arguing that it had put in place significant safeguards against abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.636" offset="681631">The products were mentioned only in response to people who said, well, look, this product is made in such-and-such country and it's exploitative, and Nike would have a press release, or it... sometimes it would be an op ed saying no, you've got the wrong country, this product is made in such-and-such other place.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.600" offset="749549">These were letters to the editor, pamphlets.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.392" offset="760730">It was on the Internet, correspondence.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.776" offset="770238">As you might expect, the critics talked back.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.667" offset="785807">There was a lively political dialogue about the realities of the Third World and Nike's role in it, a little hard to separate the two, when, as the dissenter below, one of the dissenters below said Nike had become the poster child for the evils, supposedly, of globalization, so not surprisingly the debate was inconclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.790" offset="862294">The surprise came when the story took an unusual turn, unusual at least in our system of Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.941" offset="886849">One of the Nike critics, Marc Kasky, asked the California courts to endorse his view and to hold that the statements that Nike was putting out were false or were misleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.010" offset="947140">He invoked California's unfair competition law and the false advertising law that it included, which gives anyone standing, so Mr. Kasky certainly qualified, to sue another person or corporation, here Nike and its officers, for making any statement in a newspaper or other publication such, it goes on to say, or any advertising device, including over the Internet, concerning any circumstance or matter of fact connected with anything the speaker intends to sell if the statement is untrue or misleading, and the California Supreme Court has read that to cover anything that might mislead the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.369" offset="1140655">The plaintiff, empowered to sue by the Business and Professions Code 17204 on behalf of, quote, the general public, unquote, did not, under California decisional law, have to allege or prove falsity... it could be an omission that made something misleading... he didn't have to allege or prove reliance by or injury to anyone, or any particular level of fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.536" offset="1261236">An inadvertent omission will suffice under the Day decision.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="279.446" stopTime="286.973">
            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="279.446" offset="1276909">Well, certainly some omissions, even though not technically false, could be false in their... in what they convey.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="laurence_h_tribe" startTime="286.973" stopTime="420.372">
            <label>Mr. Laurence H. Tribe</label>
            <text syncTime="286.973" offset="1307002">Certainly, Mr. Chief Justice, and, in fact, one of the suggestions made by the California Supreme Court for how a company could engage in this debate without any problem is simply omit all the facts that might connect it to the situation, and that kind of omission, it would be certainly alleged, would be misleading, so the only solution that Nike is given is, talk in vague generalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.236" offset="1412119">I don't deny, Mr. Chief Justice, that there can be cases and there can even be fraud cases, though it's hard, given the pleading requirements of the fraud tort, that do rest on omissions, but I'm just suggesting how... how capacious... how capacious this is.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.147" offset="1479724">The relief that is available and was requested by Mr. Kasky includes, and I don't think we should forget the importance of this, an adjudication that the defendant is guilty of an unlawful business practice, and in Nike's case that would be no small matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.370" offset="1556629">I mean, it would be said you're guilty of exploiting women and children in the Third World, guilty as charged, and not being honest about it, a scarlet letter more damning than the label of National Labor Relations Act violator that this Court a year ago in B&amp;K versus NLRB treated as so grave a blot on the reputation of a company that it mustn't be imposed for activity within the First Amendment zone without giving the defendant significant leeway.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.214" offset="1708034">Secondly, there is available a court-ordered injunction both prohibitory and mandatory in one case involving the Alta-Dena Dairy in California under this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.538" offset="1757249">The Consumers Union of the United States brought the suit as a Private Attorney General against a dairy that had been putting out its products of raw milk saying they were just as nutritious and healthy as pasteurized milk, and the remedy was a 10-year mandate of corrective speech, as it were, corrective education.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="420.372" stopTime="426.728">
            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="420.372" offset="1840632">To... to make them realize that raw milk was not as good as pasteurized milk?</text>

            <text syncTime="426.728" offset="1866023">Well, I guess to make some people... this... that's what the statute says, that some people might have been misled.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.842" offset="1886503">Needless to say, the kind of show trial that would be involved in this case is a lot more expensive than that one.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.171" offset="1915864">That case, by the way, took 54 days to try, 44 witnesses, there were 40,000 pages of exhibits, at the end a restitutionary order of $100,000 was given, and in that case the Attorney General joined the suit, he collected the restitution--</text>

I suppose there are some criminal remedies here, but let's just think about this as a civil scheme, that a civil scheme of this type is so burdensome, so extensive that it chills speech and is therefore invalid?</text>

            <text syncTime="489.492" offset="2117112">It seems to me that the Court in the National Labor Relations Act context itself took the position in B&amp;K that chilling effect was important, and what about defamation?</text>
            <text syncTime="503.106" offset="2171551">I mean, the central meaning of New York Times v. Sullivan and Gertz and, you know, and Time v. Hill is that even when you have someone who is harmed, reputational harm, concrete harm, so that the regulation of speech is simply ancillary to vindicating tangible interest, even there the chilling effect is so great that even though there's no positive value in false statements you have to put a burden... it's a matter of public interest.</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence H. Tribe</label>
            <text syncTime="4171.274" offset="16844217">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4178.243" offset="16872116">Let me just deal with a couple of technical things first.</text>
            <text syncTime="4182.444" offset="16888939">The Attorney General of California was notified below.</text>
            <text syncTime="4186.008" offset="16903149">He filed a brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4187.024" offset="16907224">It's not required in California that all of the arguments be rehearsed before him, and most importantly the California Supreme Court passed on the fundamental claim that this scheme, applied to public debate, violates the First Amendment, and under Yee v. Escondido in any event we can make a different argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4209.274" offset="16996250">But if you look at the brief below, the most telling part of it, I think... and it gets to the pivot of this case... this is at pages 30 to 31 of the California Supreme Court brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4220.289" offset="17040240">It there recites that if the shoe, as it were, were on the other foot, under California law this case would go away in an instant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4227.870" offset="17070646">The case decided unanimously by the Supreme Court of California in 1984 is Epic v. Superior Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4234.257" offset="17096142">In that case there was an ideological boycott of companies that were doing business with the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="4241.324" offset="17124459">The plaintiff was not thought to be environmentally friendly enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="4244.587" offset="17137520">The plaintiff sued for trade libel, they wanted damages, they wanted an injunction, they said it was interference with contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="4251.086" offset="17163433">The trial court was about to hold the trial and the Supreme Court of California, citing Article 1, section 2 of its constitution, said, hey, public debate, there are interests on both sides, but the courts of California can't resolve it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4266.207" offset="17223933">It seems to me that what we have here, and this goes to the question of the Private Attorney General action, is that if there is a debate between interests of labor and interests of management, the California Supreme Court has transmogrified this old statute, which was pretty strange to begin with but had never been used to stifle and silence the public debate, it's transformed it into a conversation-stopper, and the power to do that is, I think, extraordinary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4296.136" offset="17343678">They say, maybe there will be a chill.</text>
            <text syncTime="4298.585" offset="17353500">If you look at the media brief, the media are now saying that businesses around the world are already afraid to communicate with us because California may get them, and the European brief, filed by a consortium that controls about $2 trillion of investment, says that the efforts of the European Union to encourage transparency are being frustrated by California saying that if you come out and answer these charges, as they did in the letter to the athletic directors, you can be trapped, because you're a business, so you're trying to make money, so it's commercial speech.</text>
