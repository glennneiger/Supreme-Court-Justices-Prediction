            <text syncTime="62.154" offset="398716">In particular, the FCC views the failure to make a timely regulatory payment as a proxy for a determination that continued possession of the license is not in the public interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="140.699" offset="712917">--With respect, Justice, Chief Justice Rehnquist, when it says automatic, what it means is that it cancels without any, the need for any further action from the commission, but in any given case, the cancellation of a license is a result both of the automatic cancellation rule and the fact that a payment deadline has come forward, and where the commission has discretion is in relaxing the payment deadline, and you can see that in this very case.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.255" offset="819079">NextWave's license is canceled, according to the FCC, because NextWave failed to make the very first installment payment due under those licenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.538" offset="856277">Now, according to the licenses in the first instance, that payment was due on April 30, 1997, but the licenses didn't cancel on April 30, 1997 because the commission in its discretion, as part of a multifactor public interest determination, extended the payment deadline a full 18 months.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="195.974" offset="934017">Well, Mr. Clement, it appears to me that the FCC went along with the bankruptcy filing, filed a claim for the amount that wasn't paid, and apparently went along with the proposals for a while to work this out and then, very shortly before the decision to reauction the things, the FCC decided not to go along with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.963" offset="1053972">That doesn't sound like some automatic cancellation.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.771" offset="1069123">I mean, the FCC appeared to treat it very much like the bankruptcy claim for quite some time, didn't it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="236.782" offset="1097231">Well, to be sure, the FCC participated in the bankruptcy proceedings and protected its interests as a creditor, but at the same time it has independent interests as a regulator, and the FCC, as we point out on page 19 of the reply brief, made clear at various points well before NextWave went into bankruptcy that it did not view bankruptcy as an exception from the regulatory provisions of the Communications Act, and I think if you look at the specific event that NextWave points to as the automatic cancellation, it's the failure to make a payment that was due on October 29, 1998, and it was due on the 29th of October, 1998, rather than April 30, 1997, precisely because of a public interest determination by the commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="285.697" offset="1292835">You say a public interest determination, but the only correlation that seems clear to me is a purely economic correlation.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.326" offset="1327422">When the value of the leases dropped, the FCC apparently went into the Bankruptcy Court and said, we want our full $4 billion, and when the value of the leases went up, the FCC took the position, we want to reauction them and get the increase in value.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.386" offset="1419582">It seems at each point at which the FCC made a decision, it was making an economic decision, not a regulatory decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="325.903" offset="1453645">With respect, Justice Souter, I don't think that's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.728" offset="1465035">When... I mean, it is true that the FCC tried to go in and protect its interests as a creditor, but at the point that NextWave was trying to keep its regulatory licenses that it promised to pay $4.7 billion for, and trying to keep those licenses for just over a billion, the result of that process would have been that the rest of that amount, the $3 billion plus, would have been an unsecured claim of the FCC, that would have been really worth virtually nothing, so I think the better way to understand this case is that the FCC does have interests as a creditor, and it has tried to protect those interests in the bankruptcy proceedings and has participated in those proceedings, but at the same time, it has interests with the... as a regulator, and in its capacity as a regulator it hasn't acted in a way that would result in a sole-cause cancellation.</text>

            <text syncTime="379.218" offset="1666909">Mr. Clement, suppose... and I consider this a classic case for what this provision of the Bankruptcy Code was directed to.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.207" offset="1698883">Suppose you have a State law that says anyone who is in default of traffic tickets that amount to more than $500 shall have his license revoked, okay, and the person in question goes into bankruptcy, doesn't pay the $500, gets the $500 discharged in bankruptcy, the State you think can revoke his license?</text>

            <text syncTime="2002.509" offset="8160114">Now, I base that on first reading the purposes of this in the history, and reading the whole legislative history, which will not convince some of my colleagues, but nonetheless is a factor in what I think, and I think that this is clearly about a future loan, a future situation in which the future situation, the Government is forbidden to discriminate against a human being because he was once in bankruptcy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2058.973" offset="8386021">First, the text of 525 is unambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.804" offset="8401276">It applies to someone who is or was a debtor, and it applies to debts that are dischargeable, as well as those that have been discharged and, therefore, it is clear on the face of the statute that it applies and protects companies while they are reorganizing and before the debts are discharged, so I think on the face of the statute that's... it's not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.513" offset="8492182">It's not the right reading of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2092.454" offset="8519872">Now, if... if this had been a situation where the FCC had demanded cash on the barrelhead up front, and NextWave had gone and bid and gone out and borrowed that money from a bank, and had to pay the bank over time, and then filed for bankruptcy, there would be no question that that, that the debt to the bank could be reorganized and disposed of in the normal manner in bankruptcy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2493.263" offset="10123164">And the FCC says in the reconsideration order, thus, the only way that NextWave could have avoided the loss of its licenses, even under the rule interpretation it urges, was to have avoided default by making full and timely payment on or before the payment due date.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.851" offset="10189515">If the only way that NextWave could have avoided default was by making the payment, then there is nothing else that could have been shown, and nothing else that could have happened in the reconsideration process or any waiver process, that would have provided an additional ground for revocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.842" offset="10257433">And if I could also point the court to a statement on the prior page, page 73a: For all these reasons we reject NextWave's interpretation of our default and cancellation rules and reaffirm that the failure to make full payment in a timely manner, following exhaustion of all applicable grace periods, constitutes a default and results in the automatic cancellation of the license without further commission action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.009" offset="10354086">Their theory is that this happens by operation of law on the day after nonpayment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.525" offset="10380208">It is as automatic as anything can be, and nothing about the reconsideration process, and nothing about their waiver authority changes that one iota.</text>

            <text syncTime="2588.746" offset="10505074">They also said in the restructuring orders, Justice Ginsburg, that you referred to earlier, in each of the restructuring orders they said they would not grant a waiver of the payment deadline under any circumstances, and then when individual licensees sought waivers, the FCC rejected the waiver requests, and it cited back to those provisions in the restructuring order saying, we told you this was an automatic rule, and we reject your request, and it did so even in instances, in two cases where the licensees were providing service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.159" offset="10622729">And so there's just no question that this was an automatic cancelation rule and therefore precisely at the core of what section 525 forbids the FCC or any other licensing agencies from doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.522" offset="10672153">If I may, I want to turn to the question of whether there is any conflict between the FCC's exercise of its authority under section 309(j) and the Bankruptcy Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.432" offset="10723771">The answer is, as a statutory matter there is no conflict, because the FCC was not required to have an installment payment plan, and even if it were required to have one there wouldn't be a conflict because Congress didn't say that the FCC had to make license revocation automatic upon nonpayment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.608" offset="10792525">So the FCC's argument really is an implied repeal argument here, that 309(j) implicitly repeals 525 in some applications, but--</text>

            <text syncTime="2949.642" offset="11948600">The word solely, I think, does serve a function there, and that is, in its absence I suppose it would be possible for a licensee in regulatory default, a licensee who hadn't built out, to hide behind the existence of a fiscal default and say, you see, it's because of the fact that I didn't make a payment, not because I didn't build out.</text>

            <text syncTime="3174.877" offset="12849616">What I'm saying, Justice Breyer, is that after bankruptcy, if NextWave, for example, were to emerge from bankruptcy they would still have the license, but only on conditions in which you as the FCC, like other creditors, in light of your secured interest, had taken an appropriate piece of the pie.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.153" offset="12954733">You don't get it all, that's the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.304" offset="12963301">Nor does a private creditor get to grab the license and all the value from all the other creditors and, in fact, when you are an agency that is wearing really two sets of shoes, the ordinary regulator's running shoes but also the wing tips of the creditor agency, it makes the situation worse, not better.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.359" offset="13075523">That is, this law is designed to assure that even the agency, which does not have a monetary interest, can't simply yank all the value for itself because it has the power over this license.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.616" offset="13140515">If the agency, on top of all that, is a creditor and has that additional set of incentives, then it's all the worse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.838" offset="13181475">You wonder, for example, why it is that in the MMDS licenses, in which there are licenses that are held by a number of bankrupt licensees who did not make the payments they promised to make, why it is that the FCC does not regard them as not having been what they looked like at the time of the bid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.536" offset="13296205">The reason is that it's been paid in full.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.316" offset="13307386">So it really is a situation in which the FCC's position as a creditor should not redound to its credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.243" offset="13355033">If anything, that makes this statute all the more vital.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.848" offset="13369453">The capital formation that is necessary to make 309(j) work, to make it possible, Justice Scalia, sometimes not to demand all the money up front, but to have something more creative, maybe demand letters of credit, guarantees, none of that can work if creditors who put in over half a billion dollars, not in a gamble but on a very careful business plan that was completely carried out, they're not providing service, but Catch-22, it's because their attempt to emerge and fully cure any default was frustrated by the agency that saw pie in the sky, large numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.486" offset="13567983">In that situation, for the agency to be able to collapse the capital formation here tells us something rather unpleasant about the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.553" offset="13624303">How likely is it that Citicorp and the California and Kansas pension funds and all of the other organizations that have put money in on reliance on the way section 525 works will do this again next time around?</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.073" offset="13698386">The formation of capital, the market on which the FCC chose to rely, choosing to rely in the capacity of a first lender, with no more or less secured protection than others, that whole system depends on, in the most literal sense, the rule of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.600" offset="13804444">It does not depend on the question whether we can attribute to the regulator some motive that does not relate solely to the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.568" offset="13848329">So if the system is to work the way the FCC claims, 525 is a dead letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.409" offset="13883751">Now, if you were right, Justice Breyer, if there really was a problem that couldn't be solved in the way the confirmation rules work, in the way the pie is divided up, then maybe, as with perishable commodities, there would be a problem for Congress to solve.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.939" offset="13949789">Congress has in section 523 enumerated 18 categories of debts that are not dischargeable in bankruptcy, and sometimes it does it in another statute, not always in the Bankruptcy Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.571" offset="14008408">These are policy judgments about whether something is unique about the situation that requires treating the Government in some different way, the way the Department of Agriculture is treated.</text>

            <text syncTime="3482.048" offset="14078311">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.845" offset="14093462">Let me first address Justice O'Connor's very proper concern that licensees are going to be able to enjoy their licenses for much less than they agreed to pay the commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.196" offset="14130870">That is not a dead letter and, in fact, one of the cases that is being held for this case involves Kansas PCS, where the bankruptcy court approved the plan that gave the FCC 5 cents on the dollar for the value of its licenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.606" offset="14184473">Now, it's true that one mechanism to get the licenses for less than they paid for, the fraudulent conveyance theory, is something that the FCC can address.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.177" offset="14218746">That was the GWI bankruptcy, where the FCC only got 16 cents on the dollar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.741" offset="14237031">But there's a second way to do it, which is to only give the FCC the value for its security interest, the value of the licenses at that point, and the bankruptcy court did that in Kansas PCS, and only gave the commission 5 cents on the dollar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.296" offset="14287291">Second, let me address Justice Kennedy's concern with, where's the authority for the FCC to take into account bankruptcy policy concerns?</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.949" offset="14317906">The authority comes from a D.C. Circuit decision called LaRose, which is cited on page 79a of the decision, the reconsideration decision that's under review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.069" offset="14354373">The LaRose decision is a D.C. Circuit decision that tells the FCC that it must take bankruptcy policy considerations into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.658" offset="14392721">Now--</text>

            <text syncTime="3561.324" offset="14395333">It's not binding on us, certainly?</text>

            <text syncTime="3570.533" offset="14432218">Now, if it failed to do it properly--</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="3572.582" offset="14440368">But this, they're saying that they're not going to take bankruptcy considerations into account.</text>

          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="3577.060" stopTime="3664.099">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="3577.060" offset="14458341">--No, they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.176" offset="14462834">They did, and again I think they... one of the reasons they took bankruptcy considerations into account is by extending payments for all the C-Block licensees for 18 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.092" offset="14498465">But if you think the problem here is that the FCC didn't do the right balancing of bankruptcy policy and telecommunications policy, then the D.C. Circuit or this case could reverse for an arbitrary capriciousness, but that's not the role of 525.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.038" offset="14550187">525 is an exceedingly narrow provision that simply prevents a regulator under any circumstances from canceling a license solely because, and here it's just not true that the failure to make a payment was the sole trigger, because you have to look at it in context, and what triggered default is the failure to make a payment of a payment that was due for a particular reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.226" offset="14639004">Now, anybody in... any FCC licensee could have gone to the commission and tried to get a further extension of that payment deadline.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.628" offset="14668574">They'd already gotten extended 18 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.600" offset="14676515">They could have gotten extended even further, and it's hard for me to understand how there's a sole trigger when the very payment deadline that is supposed to be... trigger the automatic cancelation is itself the reflection of a multifactor public interest determination by the commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.956" offset="14741926">They extended it 18 months but no further, based on a consideration of the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3652.902" offset="14761675">Now, on Justice Breyer's concern about what's going on here, I think your concern is exactly right, and what sense does it make from a bankruptcy policy to disable the Government to make installment payments?</text>
