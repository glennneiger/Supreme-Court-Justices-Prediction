            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="85166">The opinion of the Court in No. 01-1269, the City of Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio verus Buckeye Community Hope Foundation will be announced by Justice O'Connor.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="10.277" offset="126230">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.271" offset="154234">In 1995, the respondents purchased land zone for apartments in the City of Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.159" offset="185790">They submitted the site plan to the City Planning Commission proposing to build multi-family, low-income housing on the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.838" offset="220480">The City Council eventually approved the plan but strong public opposition to the project eventually coalesced into a referendum petition drive calling for the repeal of the city ordinance authorizing the project.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.757" offset="284115">Pursuant to the City Charter, the filing of the petition for referendum stayed the implementation of the site plan until the final vote on the referendum.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.544" offset="331239">While the petition was the pending, the City refused to issue respondents the building permits necessary to begin the construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.711" offset="367915">Respondents brought suit in Federal District Court alleging that the city by submitting the petition to the voters and refusing to issue the building permits gave effect to the discriminatory sentiment reflected in the public's opposition to the site plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.672" offset="439804">Thus, violating the equal protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteent Amendment, as well as the Fair Housing Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.833" offset="472405">The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the City and its officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.018" offset="493199">The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed concluding that respondents had produced sufficient evidence to go to trial on each of its claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.347" offset="530502">In an opinion filed with the Clerk of the Court today, we reverse in part and vacate and remand in part that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.552" offset="563311">Respondents have not presented an equal protection claim capable of surviving summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.792" offset="592255">Neither of the official acts respondent challenge reflect the intent necessary to support equal protection liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.114" offset="633528">Both the decisions to submit the referendum petition to the voters and the refusal to issue the permit while the petition was pending constituted non-discretionary ministerial acts consistent with the City Charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.924" offset="696849">Respondents point to no evidence suggesting that these acts were motivated by racial animus, nor did they demonstrate that the allegedly discriminatory private motives that triggered the referendum drive can fairly be attributed to the City.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.839" offset="768425">Respondents also fail to present a valid substantive due process claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.512" offset="795174">We need not decide whether they possessed a property interest in the building permits denied them by the City, because the city's refusal to issue the permits while the petition was pending in no sense constituted a egregious or arbitrary government conduct in violation of substantive due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.123" offset="877617">Moreover, our precedent forecloses respondent's claim that the City's submission of an administrative ordinance to popular vote was per se arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.718" offset="924010">The City's voters retained the power to govern through referendum with respect to any matter, legislative or administrative within the realm of city affair.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.250" offset="966119">Finally, because the respondents now have abandoned their Fair Housing Act claim, we vacate that part of the Sixth Circuit's opinion and remand the constructions to dismiss the relevant portion of the complaint with prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.614" offset="1027559">The opinion of the Court is unanimous.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.678" offset="1035814">Justice Scalia has filed a concurring opinion which Justice Thomas has joined.</text>
