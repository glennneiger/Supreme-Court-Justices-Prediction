            <text syncTime="22.924" offset="411609">We'll hear argument now in the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.725" offset="454867">Mr. Starr?</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth W. Starr</label>
            <text syncTime="36.345" offset="465316">Mr. Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.952" offset="475765">Title 1 of BCRA, along with Section 213 intrudes deeply into the political life of the nation, and does so in a way that not even the most ardently nationalist of the founding generation would have countenanced.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.454" offset="557685">The upshot is not only a Federal intrusion into state and local activity at the grassroots level, but a significant diminution in speech and associational activity by parties, activity that lies at the very core of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.828" offset="655279">BCRA's practical effect is to shift resources and power away from political parties which have long been a source of stability for the nation, and in the direction of First Amendment-protected, but at times ideologically razor-sharp interest groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.349" offset="769277">BCRA, in a word, goes too far.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.542" offset="794041">There were other ways before Congress that Congress could have employed most relevantly.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.232" offset="824866">To the extent that the concern of Congress was large contributions of non-Federal funds, those regulated by the states, then the Hagel amendment was before Congress, which would have put a cap, a ceiling on the level of contributions to the national parties, but preserving the prerogatives of the state and local parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.859" offset="951403">Secondly, to the extent that the concern was contributions being directed toward issue ads, Congress had before it the Ney amendment, which among its terms provided specifically for the non-use of such funds in connection with issue ads.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.314" offset="1045130">Thirdly, to the extent that Congress was concerned as it clearly was with the abuses of the recent past, as documented lavishly in the Thompson committee hearings, Congress could and did respond in BCRA, in unchallenged parts of BCRA, namely, 302 and 303, addressing specifically fundraising on Federal property, clarifying what had been famously said to be a lacuna, namely, no controlling legal authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.449" offset="1209702">Also, tightening the prohibitions on a common abuse in the recent past, namely, the involvement and contribution by foreign nationals, the James Riatti situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.709" offset="1274799">But Congress chose not to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.594" offset="1290263">It rather, in 323A, chose to ban, ban, not limit, but ban, but also to regulate relationships and associations among the different levels of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.531" offset="1382005">In 323B, Congress went so far as to regulate state and local political activity that is at the most grassroots level and is documented lavishly in this record, especially with respect to the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.594" offset="1478345">The record teems with indications that there will be a diminution of political activity by the political parties, both parties, both of the major parties, the California Democratic party and the California Republican party.</text>

            <text syncTime="323.926" offset="1615644">It seems to us that the firewall which was described by Senator McCain does in fact intrude into associational activity of parties and the structure of parties that this Court has found protected in a variety of cases such as University of San Francisco County, Tashjian v.

            <text syncTime="360.679" offset="1762662">And in fact, I thought you were suggesting in your earlier remarks that Congress might have done something like this.</text>

            <text syncTime="368.411" offset="1793591">Well, my point earlier was simply to say there were other alternatives that were more narrowly tailored before Congress, but with respect to transfers themselves, the transfers this record show go among to other things to enable voter mobilization at the most fundamental level and activity, and this again is documented most lavishly in California, that is focused upon such as ballot initiatives, quintessential state activity but nonetheless which Congress sweeps in under the rubric.</text>

            <text syncTime="479.942" offset="2239658">Footnote 10 in Colorado Republican II notes that there are indications in the Court's cases, including California Democratic Party v.

I don't get in what you have just said an answer to a question which would affect New York, would affect California, would affect every state, 65/35, to take a non-hypothetical ratio when there are mixed activities, when there are Federal and state candidates on the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.523" offset="2754061">As I understand the prior law, it didn't count how many.</text>

            <text syncTime="738.080" offset="3272226">If you felt that was constitutional, then why is this new allocation unconstitutional, because as I read through it, it looked like the basic problem is when you get a voter to the polls, you have to have him there to vote for a state candidate, you have to have him there for a Federal candidate, and we are going to allocate the cost of getting him there between hard money, Levin money and maybe some other money.</text>

            <text syncTime="810.322" offset="3561244">But there comes a point, Your Honor, where Congress goes too far in failing to accommodate the state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.550" offset="3598129">There is in short a necessary, under this Court's jurisprudence, and we believe anchored in the Federal Elections Clause for Congress to assiduously be mindful of displacing state law, and that is what has been done here by virtue of essentially not even trying to effect an allocation, but rather simply saying, including in context where the flow of funds from the national party to the state or local party is in an off-year election.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.853" offset="3751311">The value that we would have left up to the Court is that of congruence, proportionality.</text>

            <text syncTime="868.713" offset="3794779">When we're talk... we're talking about limits, by the way, I think it's fundamental to bear in mind that the limits with respect to Federal contributions are anchored on the idea of a contribution as for the purpose of influencing a state election.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.982" offset="3863847">What the record shows is that there is a substantial amount of donations in the system that go for quintessential state election activity, including ballot measures, initiatives, and the like.</text>

            <text syncTime="5707.594" offset="23150260">State parties can spend all of the Federal, the hard money they want with respect to those activities and then the Levin amendment, which was not required by the Constitution, not necessary, but that gave an additional ability of the state to use under certain circumstances soft money, unregulated by the Federal Government in those contexts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5728.394" offset="23233538">The bottom, at the bottom, what this legislation does is treat the very same abuses that this Court was concerned about in Buckley v. Valeo, and has said repeatedly are the types of concerns that are legitimate for Congress to be concerned about and to use the words of this Court, go to the very fundamental integrity of our government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5750.480" offset="23321832">The only thing in Title I that Congress did was to control the source of contributions, unions and corporate treasuries, and the amounts above a certain amount, and a potential circumventions of those limits.</text>
