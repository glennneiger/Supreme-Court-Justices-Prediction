            <text syncTime="59.065" offset="384945">The history of their case and of the University's defense of its discriminatory admissions policies is a powerful argument about the perils of entrusting to the discretionary judgments of educators the protection of the Constitution's guarantee of equality to all individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.432" offset="454327">For nearly 5 years, the University vigorously defended in the district court and the court of appeals the admissions systems that were in place when petitioners Gratz and Hamacher applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.364" offset="498108">These systems featured separate admissions guidelines for different races, protected or reserved seats in the class for select minorities, that is blacks, Hispanics and Native Americans, racially-segregated wait lists, and a policy of never automatically rejecting students from their preferred... from the preferred minority groups while doing so for others.</text>

            <text syncTime="396.191" offset="1733386">One of the critical things that is demonstrated in this case is how easy it is for one system to be disguised as another.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.040" offset="1772779">What has happened in this case is that for five years again, the University defended the system with its facially separate admission guidelines, with its reserved seats, and then in... two years into this case, in fact, was still using some of these particular forms in its admissions policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.241" offset="1833592">It is an indication, I think, of how difficult it is to conclude that what we have here is a system that, for example, comports with what Justice Powell indicated he was... he approved of in the... in the Bakke case.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.430" offset="1882389">What we have here is a system that was... is not narrowly tailored to achieve any governmental interest, any compelling governmental interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="448.120" offset="1941112">The fundamental problem with the diversity rationale is that it depends upon the standardless discretion of educators.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.883" offset="1980191">It is a discretion that would be exercised in a number of different respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.909" offset="2000253">And we need to be clear about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.214" offset="2009448">The University and its amicus have all made it clear that in their judgment they ought to be entitled to use race as much as necessary in their educational discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.900" offset="2052289">If that is the rule that we end up accepting, then universities are free in their discretion to choose which races are discriminated against, which are favored.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.529" offset="2094712">We can have one institution that discriminates against one group of individuals, and another against another.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.219" offset="2125536">We can have with the... with shifting fashions and... and preferences and time, the preferences for the races can shift.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.929" offset="2156361">An example of that is found in comparing the facts of this case to the Bakke case, wherein Bakke, Asian Americans were included in the preference, and under the University of Michigan's systems, they are excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.764" offset="2203695">The... the exercise of discretion will extend to who's identified in a particular race.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kirk O. Kolbo</label>
            <text syncTime="3536.596" offset="14295045">With respect to the point system, Counsel has made it sound as if it's sort of a fortuity that the University of Michigan has an admissions system that ends up admitting... admitting virtually all minority students.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.349" offset="14354082">In fact, I want to talk a little bit about the record here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.284" offset="14365785">We put in the record the guidelines from the original system that was in place in 1995 and 1997.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.110" offset="14389086">At the joint appendix, at page 80, it's made very clear that the guidelines were set in 1995, when Jennifer Gratz applied to admit all qualified minority students.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.154" offset="14441226">It's also undisputed in this record that the way the University got to the 20 points was to statistically design it based on the old model.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.236" offset="14477589">So what they've done is they've taken the old guidelines that were set to admit all qualified minority students, statistically figured out how many points they needed to give... to give to students under the new system to replicate the old system, and that's how we ended up with 20 points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.352" offset="14538088">So it... it strikes me as disingenuous to suggest that it's simply an accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.004" offset="14556687">These policies have a purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.776" offset="14563793">They grant a preference for a purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.786" offset="14571838">And the new system does what the old system did... did, which is to create a two-track system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.503" offset="14590647">It's not enough if you're Jennifer Gratz or Patrick Hamacher to be merely qualified to get admitted to the University.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.013" offset="14620740">To be admissible is not simply enough because of their skin color.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.616" offset="14635055">If however you're a member of one of the minority students and you meet those minimum qualifications, that's sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.561" offset="14654908">If that's not a two-track system, I can't imagine what one... what one would actually look like.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.110" offset="14685105">With respect to test scores, a question was made... a question was asked about how long are these systems going to last.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.197" offset="14713422">There's actually evidence, and this was not put in the... in the record by the University, with respect to test scores and disparities, but there's... there's also opposing opinion which has indicated that as long as we have these preferences, they create perverse incentives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3654.923" offset="14768384">We've cited the work of John McWhorter, for example, in our reply brief indicating that test scores to the extent that they're not narrowing, or to the extent that the gaps are increasing may, in fact, be to the fact... due to the fact of these... of these preferences.</text>
            <text syncTime="3669.039" offset="14824808">With respect to the Hobbesian choice that Mr. Payton has talked about, they have resolved a different Hobbesian choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3677.262" offset="14857723">The University has decided that they are willing to lower their academic standards to get their critical mass.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.314" offset="14881860">They've resolved that... that Hobbesian choice that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3686.306" offset="14893876">But they've resolved the other Hobbesian choice, how to get those objectives and stay selective, they've resolved that Hobbesian choice on the backs of the constitutional rights of individuals like Jennifer Gratz and Patrick Hamacher.</text>
            <text syncTime="3699.047" offset="14944867">They are the ones that are paying for the Hobbesian choice that the University has resolved with... by the use of a two-track admission system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3706.980" offset="14976527">With respect to the concept of critical mass, all I have to say, if one can't ascertain from the way it's defined, meaningful means sufficient, sufficient means critical, critical means sufficient, that meets the definition, it seems to me, of an interest that's too amorphous, too ill-defined, too indefinite, just like the role model theory, just like a remedy for societal discrimination, too indefinite to support the use of a compelling... to suit... to use... to be a basis for racial preferences.</text>
