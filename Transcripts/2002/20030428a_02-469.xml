            <text syncTime="254.376" offset="1165734">And the remainder of the circuits have adopted something called the sliding scale test where you weigh both the conflict and the... the reasonableness of the decision at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.355" offset="1209724">This Court commented on that issue, I believe, in Rush v.

            <text syncTime="280.392" offset="1269806">We would submit, if I may, Your Honor, that the way to do that is to first look for conflict of interest in... in the... the way that Restatement 187 does that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1350.924" offset="5552007">We think it's in significant tension with the regulations that the Department of Labor did promulgate which do not constrain plan administrators.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.795" offset="5579488">And finally, the third reason, is that ERISA leaves to employers, private employers, the decision whether to provide benefits and, if so, the discretion to devise the form and structure of plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.064" offset="5628493">And a judge-made rule is inconsistent with these discretionary and voluntary aspects of ERISA because it tells plan administrators across the board how to weigh conflicting evidence in claims arising under varying and separate plans.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lee T. Paterson</label>
            <text syncTime="3288.145" offset="13300866">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.229" offset="13309225">The Ninth Circuit's treating physician rule is a categorical rule based upon the assumption that a treating physician's opinion is superior to other medical opinions in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.045" offset="13348408">In the Regula case, at page 1139, the Ninth Circuit got to the issue of... of the treating physician rule prior to the time it even began to discuss the conflict of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.036" offset="13396369">And it held the treating physician rule requires deference, as it applies under ERISA, and that the treating... the plan administrator in the Ninth Circuit must defer unless there are... he has good enough reasons not to defer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.677" offset="13454988">The court then later on in its opinion addressed the issue of conflict of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.164" offset="13472960">This Court in... last year in Ragsdale v. Wolverine when... stated that categorical generalizations failed to hold true that the justification for the categorical rule disappears.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.606" offset="13522697">In the facts of this case, that categorical justification disappears both in the individual facts of the case and as a general proposition for all other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.426" offset="13561986">In the facts of this case, respondent went to Dr. Hartman, his internist, with back problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.374" offset="13581734">Dr. Hartman referred him to two specialists, Dr. Zandpour and Dr. Ali, both of whom examined him, tested him, and diagnosed his condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.883" offset="13615798">Both Dr. Ali and Dr. Zandpour, based upon the tests they conducted, provided a diagnosis of mild degenerative changes of the lower lumbar spine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.132" offset="13652787">The employers sent the respondent to another specialist, Dr. Mitri, a neurologist, who agreed with the opinions of Dr. Zandpour and Dr. Ali, but also looked at the job duties of respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.734" offset="13707226">Dr. Mitri opined that he could perform the duties of a material planner if he was allowed to stand up and walk periodically.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.595" offset="13742648">Just focusing on these four physicians' opinions, it's clear that the opinions with the most weight are the three specialists, Dr. Zandpour, Dr. Ali, and Dr. Mitri, not the treating physician, Dr. Hartman.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.649" offset="13790818">However, the Ninth Circuit's rule requires the plan administrator to give deference, special weight, and a presumption in favor of Dr. Hartman's opinion even though he referred respondent to specialists for evaluation and even though he has no apparent expertise in back injuries or back pain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.160" offset="13860931">In the facts of this case, the categorical generalization is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.446" offset="13878067">In addition, the amicus, American Medical Association, has brought before this Court its statistics published in its own publication, the Journal of the American Medical Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.247" offset="13921221">Those statistics state that 39 percent of treating physicians misrepresent symptoms, diagnosis, and severity of illness when their patients submit insurance claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.067" offset="13964585">There's no justification for a categorical rule that treating physicians' opinions are entitled to special weight, deference, and a presumption in ERISA disability benefit determinations when the professional organization of the treating physicians admits that treating physicians often make misrepresentations when their patients are filing insurance claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.643" offset="14042848">There's no support for a categorical rule that treating physicians' opinions are more reliable than other medical opinions either in the facts of this case or in the... the ERISA context in general.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.063" offset="14088510">In every case, the ERISA plan administrator should weigh not only the source of the opinion, but also the experience, the testing, the treatment, and the credentials of the... of the physician.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.950" offset="14132082">We respectfully submit that this Court should reject the Ninth Circuit's treating physician rule and remand this case back to the Ninth Circuit.</text>
