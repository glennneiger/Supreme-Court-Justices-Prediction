            <text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text>Alaska's Megan's Law makes available to members of the public who seek it certain truthful information about convicted sex offenders.</text>
            <text>The State makes this information available to help protect against the risk that the convicted sex offender will offend again.</text>
            <text>It says that in the law.</text>
            <text>Sex offenses are crimes of opportunity, and the purpose of making the information available is to allow the members of the public to take steps to reduce those opportunities.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>One... one line that I... I think there is respondents seek to establish in this case is that this information has to be generated by acts that occur after the conviction.</text>
            <text>You have to fill out the form some... four times a year, et cetera.</text>
            <text>I... I've read in the brief... I'm sure my colleagues have too the... the problem about going to the police station.</text>
            <text>Just assume hypothetically that you had to go to the police station four times a year.</text>

            <text>No, it wouldn't, Your Honor.</text>
            <text>That's the case in... in about 14 States that... that a quarterly verification has to be in person.</text>
            <text>It is not the case in Alaska.</text>
            <text>And simply going to the police station four times a year, which is reserved only for the most serious sex offenses, the aggravated offenses... in all other cases it's just annually... doesn't rise to the level of a burden that is at all tantamount to what we think of as punishment under the Ex Post Facto Clause.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Could... could the administrative authorities interpret the statute so that you would have to go to the station without amending the statute?</text>

            <label>Mr. John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text>I don't think so, because the statute says the initial registration has to be in person.</text>
            <text>Typically it's in... in prison.</text>
            <text>And then it says the later verification has to be in writing.</text>
            <text>So I think it would be an unreasonable reading of the statute to say that the later verification had to be in writing.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Do we have an issue here because this law was passed after a number of the people affected by it had already been convicted, and so there are allegations of retroactivity concerns?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_g_roberts_jr">
            <label>Mr. John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text>The question is whether the burdens that the law imposes constitute punishment.</text>
            <text>If it's not punishment, then it's perfectly valid to apply it to people who were convicted prior to the effective date.</text>
            <text>And this is not--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Mr. Roberts, the only challenge in this case is to the retroactivity.</text>
            <text>Is that correct?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_g_roberts_jr">
            <label>Mr. John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text>--Only the ex post facto challenge is before the Court in this case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>And that's because these people were tried, convicted, served their time before the passage of the act.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_g_roberts_jr">
            <label>Mr. John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text>That's correct, and--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>And their principal complaint, as I understand it, is that this is punishment because we can't get out.</text>
            <text>There's no escape from it.</text>
            <text>We can prove with expert testimony that we are cured.</text>
            <text>Nothing will get us out from under this demeaning regime, that much more than the burden of going to a police station, that that's what it's about, that we're locked into this for life and it has a devastating effect on our lives.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_g_roberts_jr">
            <label>Mr. John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text>--Well, for life, again only for aggravated; for 15 years for other sex offenses.</text>
            <text>And yes, that is one of their arguments, that they can't get out of it.</text>
            <text>But this Court's cases haven't drawn that line.</text>
            <text>The question is whether the burdens are pursuant to a legitimate regulatory objective, or whether they're punitive.</text>
            <text>For example, in cases like Kansas against Hendricks, couldn't get out of that, and yet that didn't make it a violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause.</text>
            <text>Flemming against Nestor.</text>
            <text>You couldn't avoid the sanction there, and yet it did not rise to the level of punishment.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>But there was a... there was a determination, at least in Hendricks, that you fit... currently fit into a certain category.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_g_roberts_jr">
            <label>Mr. John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text>A... a particular subclass, yes.</text>
            <text>It was an individualized determination required because the depravation there, actual confinement, was far more severe than the depravation at issue here.</text>
            <text>But neither an individual determination, nor a chance to get out of it is required to avoid the categorization as punishment.</text>
            <text>Cases like Hawker and De Veau make clear that a... a reasonable legislature can treat a category... a category of sex offenders.</text>
            <text>They don't--</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>But in Hawker, you didn't have to do anything.</text>
            <text>Here--</text>

          <turn speaker="john_g_roberts_jr">

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <text>And this... and this seems to me very, very burdensome and to differentiate this class.</text>

            <label>Mr. John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text>--Not true, of course, in Hendricks or Flemming or Salerno, no opportunity to avoid it there.</text>
            <text>You didn't have to do anything to get the sanction applied to you.</text>

            <text>That's the form that's involved here.</text>
            <text>That in itself cannot be punishment.</text>
            <text>We... as Your Honor mentioned... we do that all the time in... in today's society.</text>
            <text>So it must be something else that makes this punishment.</text>
            <text>Now, what the Ninth Circuit's... Ninth Circuit thought was that it was publishing it on the Internet, that that made it punishment.</text>
            <text>But that's simply the most... most efficient and most economical way of making information available.</text>
            <text>It also is passive.</text>
            <text>It's not displayed to people who have no interest in the information, and in that sense is far less invasive.</text>
            <text>The publication on the Internet will... yes, it may cause adverse consequences when members of the community learn this public fact about someone's past.</text>
            <text>But the State is certainly free to weigh the convicted sex offender's interest in keeping that public fact from being widely known against the interest of those in the position of, say, Megan Kanka's parents.</text>

            <label>Mr. John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>

            <label>Mr. John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text>Well, it's called the intent effects test.</text>
            <text>You'd first see what the intent is, and that is so critical, and nearly controlling because the same sanction can be punitive or civil depending on the purpose.</text>
            <text>Even confinement can be civil if the purpose is protective.</text>
            <text>So that's why purpose is so controlling.</text>
            <text>Now, once you determined that there's a regulatory purpose, as every court has... not just every Federal court... every court to look at these laws has determined they have a valid civil regulatory purpose... then the one challenging that determination carries the heavy burden of establishing, by the clearest proof, with unmistakable evidence, that the effect is so punitive that the purported purpose must, in fact, be a charade.</text>

            <label>Mr. Theodore B. Olson</label>
            <text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text>Congress and the legislatures of 50 States have agreed that citizens should have access to truthful information concerning the identity and location of convicted sex offenders.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, I suppose that the public in theory has access to it anyway because convictions are a matter of public record, and presumably any citizen who wanted to dig deep enough could find out who had been convicted of what.</text>
            <text>What this scheme involves is getting a big megaphone, in effect, making it more readily available.</text>

            <text>I don't agree with the characterization of this as a megaphone.</text>
            <text>What I... what I would characterize it instead of saying it is the least intrusive, most passive way to provide information that is already available to citizens, and can be obtained by citizens, but to make it more accessible to them because the people have decided that they want this information.</text>

            <text>You can lose your right to practice in the securities field... and that's been held... because of a conviction or to practice banking or the right to vote.</text>

            <text>I... I'm not affected in where I live.</text>
            <text>My neighbors know that I've committed a crime, but they don't... the same reaction... the notion that I am being labeled not a convicted offender... which I am... but a sex offender, a current status... a current status with no opportunity to get out.</text>

            <text>But in part, it seems to me that there are many indicia of punishment here as well.</text>
            <text>That's why you just don't rest when the legislature says it's regulatory.</text>

            <text>In this case, there is no affirmative restraint on motion.</text>
            <text>There is no confinement.</text>

            <text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text>We believe that the Alaska Sex Offender Registration Act imposes punishment because it possesses three features which are classically considered to be punishment, and not like any other civil or regulatory measure this Court has seen before.</text>
            <text>First of all, the sanction attaches automatically and inescapably solely on a basis of a prior conviction, without any determination of present dangerousness at all.</text>
            <text>Secondly, the sanction is a pervasive regulation of the person themselves.</text>
            <text>There is no attempt to try to regulate an activity or a profession here.</text>
            <text>It's a regulation of the person himself.</text>

            <text>--how... how... this is... what is your response to Justice... to the argument that was made on the other side?</text>
            <text>It said simply this, that you're... you're raising an ex post facto claim.</text>
            <text>Now, we don't want to be nitpicking about this, but an ex post facto claim is a question of whether this is punishment, and they're saying it's not seen as punishment.</text>
            <text>It wasn't their intent to punish.</text>
            <text>It was their intent to inform so that the thing won't happen again.</text>
            <text>That's not a punitive intent.</text>
            <text>And therefore, your claims about how bad this is may be right.</text>
            <text>And suppose I accept them.</text>
            <text>Suppose I think they're right.</text>
            <text>Should I not, nonetheless, wait until somebody raises a substantive due process claim?</text>
            <text>That way you can decide if the problem with the statute is overly broad, if the problem is that some people should have it applied to them and others shouldn't.</text>
            <text>All the things that you mentioned would come into play.</text>

            <text>I think that is a proper challenge, and it was challenged at the lower court level.</text>
            <text>But we're here today on an ex post facto question before the Court, and the question is, is it punishment, or is it not?</text>
            <text>And we... we respectfully disagree that this is intended to be purely a regulatory measure.</text>
            <text>And we disagree because the State's sole reliance is on the language found in the preamble of the statute, that it's designed to protect the public.</text>

            <text>If, after all, it's not punishment to put a person in a cell... and I thought it was, but the majority thought it wasn't... why is it punishment, following the law, to simply require the person to make reports four times a year?</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <text>And... and... and you know, Hendricks and Salerno present the types of cases that are steeped in the pedigree of this Court looking to the need to protect the public from those people that are actively dangerous now, and that's why it was important in Hendricks that there was, in fact, those protections afforded to the individual.</text>
            <text>I mean, it doesn't happen automatically that Hendricks was going to be put in jail.</text>
            <text>There had to have been a jury trial, or trial by a judge with a preponderance beyond a reasonable doubt, and he's allowed an annual review.</text>

            <text>When we look to whether or not the statute imposes a punishment, I think it's important that we look to whether or not it... it's... fits with the umbrella things which have historically considered to be punishment.</text>
            <text>And that's one of our starting points, and that's why I keep going back to the concept of probation and parole because historically there's no dispute that probation is a depravation of liberty.</text>
            <text>Not... it's not like going to jail, but it's a depravation of liberty.</text>
            <text>And... and it's been considered as punishment, and that's what this thing does to people.</text>

            <text>Part of the problem with the statute, it's not just a warning of the public.</text>

            <text>It's not just a notification statute.</text>

            <text>No.</text>
            <text>But the same information is available, and it's information that's available not just going to a courthouse, but you can actually request the State for that information.</text>

            <text>What if they put every criminal conviction on the Internet?</text>
            <text>Well, there's one difference between the situation that would obtain then and the situation that... that you're objecting to here.</text>
            <text>That is, that there is not the same high recidivism rate for crimes generally that there is, apparently undisputedly, for sex crimes in the State of Alaska.</text>
            <text>And therefore, when you earlier made the argument that there is something very... something less than credible in the State's claim that it's merely trying to inform the public when, in fact, it makes no differentiation between current dangerousness and un-current dangerousness, the answer is there is... or an answer is... there is a very high recidivism rate, and that high recidivism rate does support the claim that there is something that... that it is credible to say that by publishing this information, we are simply trying to inform people of a probability of dangerousness, leaving them to do what they want.</text>
            <text>What is... is there any... do you have any response to this claim that the high recidivism rate itself supports the argument that, in fact, this is nothing but a safety information kind of measure, whereas broadcasting all criminal convictions would not be justified as having a good fit between the object and what the State was doing?</text>

            <label>Mr. John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text>I think it is very important to place the various points that have been touched on this morning in the proper legal framework.</text>
            <text>The question, Justice Kennedy, is not whether it's burdensome to require someone to fill out a form and verify it.</text>
            <text>The question is, is that so punitive that you don't believe the legislature when it says that we're doing this to prevent future harm?</text>
            <text>The question, Justice Ginsburg, is not whether it might be a better system if it included other information, or whether that would be too burdensome for the State.</text>
            <text>The question is, does the failure to put on ameliorative information convince you that the legislature was simply not telling the truth when it said we're doing this to prevent future harm?</text>
            <text>And the question is not whether you should have an individualized determination or a group determination.</text>
            <text>It is, is the group determination so irrational that you think the legislature was not really interested in preventing future harm, it was just doing this to punish?</text>
            <text>In fact, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, this Court has never found a law with a civil regulatory purpose to violate the Ex Post Facto Clause.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Is the effects test used to impeach the finding that the legislature had a regulatory intent?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_g_roberts_jr">
            <label>Mr. John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>I... I thought that it was an additional step that you had to take if you... even if you find the legislature had the... the permitted intent.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_g_roberts_jr">

            <text>--I think it only makes sense if you view it as impeaching the intent because, as Chief Justice Warren pointed out in Trop v. Dulles, the evident purpose is controlling because the same sanction can be civil or criminal.</text>
            <text>$10,000 civil penalty is not criminal.</text>
            <text>A $10,000 fine is.</text>
            <text>You don't look at the perspective of the individual because--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>So long as the legislature has a pure intent, it can have as burdensome a regulation as it wants based on previous criminal convictions?</text>

            <label>Mr. John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text>--I think if the regulation is so burdensome that it causes you to doubt the intent, then you do have a problem, but that is the purpose.</text>

            <text>You're not saying... you're saying if it's... it wouldn't violate the Ex Post Facto Clause in your view.</text>
            <text>It might violate some other clause like the substantive due process.</text>

            <label>Mr. John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text>But again, with respect to both the Ex Post Facto Clause and the Due Process Clause, the question is whether there's a rational connection between the sanction and the legislative purpose.</text>
            <text>Now, if it is too extreme, it may cause you to doubt that connection.</text>
            <text>For example, it may be... the legislature may say we think safe crackers present a risk of recidivism, so we're going to cut off their hands.</text>
            <text>There may be a rational connection there, but it's too excessive given the purpose.</text>
            <text>There's no way in which this law can be regarded as too excessive.</text>
            <text>It simply makes available information that is already a matter of public record, and publicly available because criminal trials under our system have to be public.</text>
            <text>Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
