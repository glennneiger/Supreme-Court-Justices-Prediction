            <text syncTime="157.647" offset="781878">Williams, like this case, was an AEDPA case and all Williams could do was decide whether Strickland had been unreasonably applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.909" offset="818972">Williams was... because Williams was an AEDPA case, was a 2254(d)(1) case, Williams could break no new ground by definition, and therefore, the... the fact that Williams concluded what it did about Strickland's requirement, means that that is what Strickland requires.</text>

Strickland specifically says, as we read it, that a lawyer's judgment about how to defend a client has either got to be based on complete investigation or, if it's based on less than complete investigation, it's reasonable only to the extent that reasonable professional judgment supports the limitation on investigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="239.375" offset="1108827">Bell v. Cone was not a case about the failure to investigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.585" offset="1121679">That was purely a case about counsel's decisions about what information to present to the sentencer after having done what was indisputably a thorough investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.252" offset="1160340">And the reason that's critical is because as... as we read Strickland, the whole point of the deference given to counsel's choices about what to present is premised on the adequacy of the investigation that precedes them.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.677" offset="1206003">That is what the source of the deferential stance towards presentation is.</text>

            <text syncTime="1227.177" offset="5060004">And the second half of that analysis, it seems to us, is answered a fortiori by Williams against Taylor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.085" offset="5083723">The first half of that analysis seems to us clearly to support relief here because, as I take Your Honor's question, it's a question of, well, there might be a justification for not submitting this evidence to the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="3229.977" offset="13071237">The investigation that was done in this case by trial counsel was not materially different from the investigation that was done by post-conviction counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.552" offset="13105509">It was trial counsel, after all, who obtained the social services records that documented a history of neglect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.001" offset="13131318">Trial counsel directed public defender investigators to go out and interview petitioner's family members, which they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.848" offset="13158695">Trial counsel hired a psychologist to conduct clinical interviews of petitioner which were done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.639" offset="13185862">Really the only difference between what trial counsel did and what post-conviction counsel did was that post-conviction counsel hired a social worker, a so-called mitigation specialist, who supervised the investigation and pulled the information together in a report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.750" offset="13254303">But we're talking here about whether there is a constitutional deficiency in the investigation, and any difference in the two investigations, which is really the fact that the social worker was there in the one but not the other, we think can't have constitutional significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.790" offset="13314489">I do want to say a little bit about the duty to present claim because most of the focus in the argument has been on the question of the duty to investigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.674" offset="13366003">We think that the principal defense was reasonable both because a finding of no principalship would have been an absolute bar to imposition of the death penalty and because the principalship case that the State put on here was so weak.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.737" offset="13430264">We also think it was reasonable not to present a mitigation defense either in addition to the principalship defense or instead of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.134" offset="13463909">It was reasonable not to present it in addition to the principal defense because it had a... a very serious possibility of undermining it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.560" offset="13497555">It was reasonable not to present it instead of the principalship defense because mitigating evidence is just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.471" offset="13533186">It's evidence that would be weighed against aggravating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.413" offset="13548964">It might or might not lead to a sentence of death.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.755" offset="13558368">A finding of no principalship is a categorical bar to imposition of the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.814" offset="13582610">If a single juror harbored a reasonable doubt about whether petitioner had carried out the killing himself, it would be obligated to return a verdict of life.</text>

            <text syncTime="3366.812" offset="13618554">But presumably the... the determination of the facts about the murder was made in the trial when he was determined guilty or innocent, and they found him guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.792" offset="13670486">And so to try to redetermine that at sentencing and not to offer any evidence in mitigation, do you think we can say that's reasonable?</text>

            <text syncTime="3390.281" offset="13712491">There were two different issues, one issue at the guilt phase, one issue at the sentencing, as far as the... as far as petitioner's role is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.536" offset="13749480">He was charged with first degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.474" offset="13757212">As the jury was instructed, a conviction of first degree murder does not necessarily encompass a finding of principalship, a finding that petitioner himself had carried out the killing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.502" offset="13801307">So it was perfectly understandable that petitioner's counsel would think that contesting principalship at sentencing would be a reasonable strategy.</text>

            <text syncTime="3438.277" offset="13904438">Counsel for Wiggins made a motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.591" offset="13921679">That motion was argued on October 11th, 1989 and denied at that time, the first day of the sentencing hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.734" offset="13958251">But the proffer was not made at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.563" offset="13973611">What... what counsel for my friend, the United States, described was what Mr. Schlaich he would proffer if he had to proffer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.756" offset="14018332">He made the actual proffer at the end of the sentencing proceeding, and it can be found at pages, I think, 349 to 51 of the... 348 to 51 of the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.161" offset="14063994">And there's a lengthy proffer there of what he would have shown had he been able to put on his mitigation case in the... in the method he wanted to.</text>

            <text syncTime="3496.368" offset="14136824">Here's the... here's what we would have suffered because we wouldn't have been... we weren't able to put on all of this mitigating evidence, and here it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.570" offset="14161588">And so the sum total of his mitigation case is right there on the pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.535" offset="14181441">He's described what it is and it contains nothing about the horrible abuse that this boy suffered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.563" offset="14205578">Nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.331" offset="14208608">Now, with respect to the question of whose responsibility it was, I think it is correct to focus on the... the colloquy on page 485 of the... of the joint appendix, but the question asked Mr. Schlaich there, as Justice Stevens' question suggested, was, well, he first says, well, it was Ms. Nethercott's job to develop mitigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.222" offset="14288229">And then the question put to him is what guidance did you give her, obviously, about how to develop the mitigation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.636" offset="14313829">And he says, well, what we decided to do was retry the factual case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.982" offset="14331279">That's the... that's what he says he gave as guidance with respect to developing the mitigation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.359" offset="14352804">So it's... it's completely clear that this was neglect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.671" offset="14370045">They just dropped the ball.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.118" offset="14375792">Now, with respect to what they actually did at the sentencing proceeding, picking up on Justice O'Connor's questions, I think this is critical as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.182" offset="14404109">Remember, Strickland says no hindsight, but that's an argument that works against the government in this case because what these lawyers actually did was, in opening statement, invite the jury specifically to consider not only the facts of the crime but, quote, who this person is, said they would hear he had a difficult life.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.319" offset="14480595">And then they didn't deliver on that promise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.166" offset="14488014">But not only that, Dr. Johnson, the... the criminologist, got up and testified, well, yes, violent people do tend to adjust well in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.166" offset="14519988">Well, that's not focusing on principalship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.511" offset="14529392">That, once again, is inviting the jury beyond principalship into the mitigation inquiry and giving them some reason to... to mitigate, but of course, omitting all of the extraordinarily powerful reasons to mitigate that the social history shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.838" offset="14582682">And then third, there was as a matter of law in Maryland a pre-sentence report that had to go to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.289" offset="14604520">And there was nothing that Wiggins' lawyers could do to stop that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.546" offset="14613506">And that pre-sentence report gave a highly misleading and negative portrayal of Wiggins' background.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.863" offset="14638793">And the... what... effect of what these lawyers did was to leave that unrebutted, further damaging Wiggins' prospects, further ensuring that he was going to get a death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.404" offset="14676931">Now, if I could conclude by just reminding this Court that very recently in the Miller-El case, this Court said even in the context of Federal habeas, the deferential review of Federal habeas, there's a difference between deference and abdication.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.964" offset="14735237">And what my friends on the other side are asking for here is the latter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.950" offset="14751119">They are asking for abdication.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.641" offset="14757911">They are asking this Court to uphold a judgment even though the only factual finding the Maryland Court of Appeals made was wrong by clear and convincing evidence, and even though that proffer demonstrates that Wiggins' lawyers did not do the work necessary and did not know the powerful mitigation case that could have been made to save this man's life.</text>
