            <text syncTime="26.339" offset="254401">The Ninth Circuit's grant of habeas relief in this case should be reversed for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.798" offset="272164">First, the court erred in setting aside the State court judgment because it did not properly apply the principles of habeas corpus review to cases that are considered under the AEDPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.283" offset="314169">As confirmed in two concurring opinions issued by this Court yesterday, Early v. Hill and Woodford v. Visciotti, this case is resolvable on AEDPA grounds and therefore the Court need not address the constitutional issues in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.515" offset="375086">In any event, independent of the habeas corpus aspects of this case, the sentence in this case is not grossly disproportionate and therefore does not violate this... the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.835" offset="416360">Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2254(d), a Federal court may not grant habeas relief unless the State court determination on the merits was either contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of this Court's clear controlling precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.257" offset="474038">In this case, the Ninth Circuit held that the State court determination involved an unreasonable application.</text>

            <text syncTime="90.120" offset="509460">Is this the case in which the Ninth Circuit first decided for itself the constitutional question, and then decided whether the State court had reasonably applied it?</text>

          <turn speaker="douglas_p_danzig" startTime="100.605" stopTime="230.227">
            <label>Mr. Douglas P. Danzig</label>
            <text syncTime="100.605" offset="551465">--Yes, that is correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.887" offset="556585">Despite the Ninth Circuit's holding in this case, a careful analysis of the Ninth Circuit's opinion here reveals that although they reversed, or granted habeas relief, reversing the district court on unreasonable application grounds, the fact of the matter is this, all of the reasoning lends itself to a contrary-to analysis rather than an unreasonable application, and opposing, or the respondent has, in fact briefed the contrary-to prong of the 2254 as well as the unreasonable application prong.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.035" offset="689183">For example, the... and for the most part the circuit court held that holding was based on the conclusion that the State court merits determination erred because it did not consider the three-case triumvirate of Rummel, Solem, and Harmelin, and faulted the State court for failing to apply, or essentially disregarding Solem, but as Early v. Packer made clear yesterday, on... when we are talking about a contrary-to application, it's not necessary for the State court to have cited this Court's controlling authority, and it's not even necessary for the Court to be aware of it, and in fact the State court in this case cited, or provided what we call a Lynch analysis under California law, which incorporated virtually every aspect of the Solem analysis that the State court said... pardon me, that the Ninth Circuit said the State court disregarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.030" offset="921150">So on that basis alone, and I think Early makes... the per curiam opinion in Early makes clear that that's okay if you have an application of State law, or you rely on State law that provides even greater depth of analysis than the Federal rule would require, and that's what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.401" offset="994606">The Lynch analysis requires what would be comparable to the second and third prongs under the Solem analysis, which, following Harmelin, are deemed no longer required unless... and serve only to validate an initial inference on the first prong, so this was clearly not a contrary-to case.</text>

            <text syncTime="277.863" offset="1260428">The Ninth Circuit disposed of the unreasonable application analysis in a footnote, and it basically said that the State court's reliance on State law is irrelevant because it didn't cite Federal law, and I think that the decision yesterday in Early v. Hill kind of renders that particular portion of the analysis--</text>

            <text syncTime="411.034" offset="1793117">Now, you're going to say, well, it has that right, and of course it does to a degree, but is there a way to say that it has to meet some burden, or that it has to show something if it's going to change dramatically what was the consensus in the past--</text>

            <text syncTime="438.898" offset="1904608">First of all, turning back to one of the questions Justice Souter asked in the prior argument, I believe that when the State is going to define certain felonies as being sufficiently serious to trigger the imposition of the three strikes, or three strikes approach or harsher sentencing, I think a rational basis... the courts may be required to engage in a heightened scrutiny analysis to determine whether there's a rational basis for that in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.755" offset="2020069">But I think that's distinct from any proportionality analysis, and the problem with the hypothetical that you pose is that, while you are correct that there is a subjective prong to this, the question is, where does that subjectivity belong?</text>
            <text syncTime="482.820" offset="2080255">Is it within the particular personal subjective views of the reviewing court, or is it within the confines of the subjective views as reflect... that the legislature represents of the subjective views of the citizenry?</text>

            <text syncTime="1512.129" offset="6197571">Curiously, though, that court also noted that if it felt that it read the law as having discretion to impose concurrent rather than consecutive sentences, it might consider it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1530.466" offset="6270923">Ultimately, though, about a year later, the California supreme court issued another case called People v. Garcia in which the supreme court said that sentencing courts have a right to dismiss strikes on a count-by-count basis, and Mr. Andrade has never asked by any vehicle for a reconsideration of that issue, so in theory he could go back at this point and file another State habeas corpus petition and ask for what we would call Garcia consideration, and... which, based on what the court, the sentencing court had previously indicated, the court might be inclined to grant him, which would reduce this sentence if, assuming it was applied to one of the counts, to a 25-year-to-life sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2665.922" offset="10812677">When we are asking whether there is clearly established law, I think we've got to take into consideration something that has become clear from, I think has become clear from this argument, and that is that there is a question as to whether the test is genuinely a proportionality or a gross disproportionality test, or whether that is simply an example of a kind of rational basis test, because we've had this difficulty in fitting the recidivism into the structure of proportionality analysis, and I think what tends to come out in the answers that we've gotten this morning is, there's more than just proportionality which is being considered here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3408.276" offset="13782172">Given the limited time, there are just a couple of brief points I would like to make about respondent's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.799" offset="13816236">I think it's clear that when he's arguing that the proportionality analysis has to be confined to the predicate offenses and the triggering offense, without regard to the entire record, what he is essentially doing is raising a facial challenge to the statute despite the fact that the Ninth Circuit claimed that they were not invalidating the statute, and to that extent that any facial challenge can be made, the ameliorating provisions of the California scheme would result in a finding that the statute is not... in... unconstitutional on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.253" offset="13970045">Secondly, just as a points, a couple of points of correction... the Court has already touched upon it... the court of appeal did not question whether the proportionality analysis was correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.368" offset="14010482">It questioned whether Solem's version of the proportionality analysis was still correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.114" offset="14029499">That's what the State court did, and it still went ahead and applied a proportionality analysis via a State court decision of Lynch.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.916" offset="14060637">And in terms of whether gross disproportionality was addressed or not, the State used, or the State court used a standard articulated from Lynch, which is shocks the conscience, and it is much stronger language and is at least reasonably a euphemism for grossly disproportionate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.895" offset="14140572">Also, I will find the page in just a moment, but I believe at the sentencing hearing the judge did indicate that he had considered the probation report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.637" offset="14179547">It's in the joint appendix, and I will find the cite in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.610" offset="14191459">Ultimately, if there's any doubt about whether there's clear precedent or not, the... I think that the State court determination should be given deference in this case, and almost finally, not... Andrade did not receive life for three burglaries and two petties, he received that because the ameliorating provisions go into the analysis, and as he was not granted the benefit of any of them, and in fact hasn't even asserted one of them, he did not receive that sentence for that, for strictly life for three burglaries and two petties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.873" offset="14328549">He's received it based on his overall record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.695" offset="14339834">In terms of whether there are... anyone else in California has suffered a similar sentence, while we... I have no reference to any 50-year-to-life sentences based on two convictions, there are 300 and... approximately 344 defendants in California serving 25-year-to-life sentences for petty offense, offense with a prior which constitutes the one 25-to-life sentence.</text>
