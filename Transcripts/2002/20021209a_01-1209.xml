            <text syncTime="13.160" offset="203985">The Internal Revenue Code generally requires every corporation to pay an annual tax measured by its entire net income, but Congress decided 30 years ago in the DISC and FSC statutes that it wished to encourage exports by giving favorable tax treatment to the portion of a company's net income that's attributable to export sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.805" offset="290607">In order to determine the extent of this income tax benefit, it's obviously critically important to determine precisely how much net income is generated by a company's export sales in any particular year.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.745" offset="346405">In enacting the DISC statute, Congress said quite specifically how it expected this export net income calculation to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.141" offset="379946">Gross revenues from export sales were to be reduced only by those costs that were directly and factually related to the export income.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.683" offset="418085">Export sales revenues were not to be burdened with unrelated expenses which would distort the true amount of export income, and thereby reduce the intended incentive.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.885" offset="462911">The DISC regulations, which were promulgated shortly after the statute was passed, reiterate that there must be a direct factual relationship between export sales and expenses.</text>

            <text syncTime="118.866" offset="626856">We think that the common sense nature of the word attributable, which this Court in the tax context has construed to mean generated by, or caused by, is that you have to take the export... the revenues from exports and reduce them only by the costs or deductions that are related to those exports, or else you can't possibly come up with a true figure of export... net export income that's attributable to those... to those sales.</text>

            <text syncTime="1727.454" offset="7061233">If it were done on a transactional basis, which is the... the base case provision under DISC, 861 regs would tell us how to allocate costs to the income from that transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.587" offset="7109716">And what... I mean, really the... the first point of departure that Mr. Geller made from the statute is that he suggests that only costs... or that any... the costs must be factually related to an item of income to be set off against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.588" offset="7169693">But that's not the statutory standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="1756.917" offset="7178993">Well, this is kind of simplistic, but it does seem that in... in the 1970s, Congress wanted to encourage exports, and to do that, they thought they should make some income tax advantages for companies producing products for export.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.007" offset="7255375">And that involved allowing grouping of products and favorable income tax treatment which, if you didn't have the... the 861 regulations on R&amp;D, would allow the taxpayer to do what the petitioner is arguing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.382" offset="7344923">So, it seems to me the argument is that the 861 regs are just so contrary to DISC that they shouldn't govern and don't govern.</text>

            <text syncTime="2293.580" offset="9325736">This is an exceptional situation created by the Congress allowing the current deduction, but as Justice Souter pointed out, allowing the current deduction for research doesn't mean that that's... that Congress decided it was definitely related when it was taken.</text>

            <text syncTime="3493.715" offset="14126206">Now, the Government tries to defend this regulation here on the... on the basis that there's this temporal mismatch and it's all the result of not capitalizing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.753" offset="14158389">I should say a number of things about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.575" offset="14165703">First, this was not the basis for the regulation at the time the regulation was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.329" offset="14180645">It was not the basis for defending this regulation in the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.376" offset="14192870">And it... and the Government's position is not even consistent with that regulation because if the whole problem here is the lack of a temporal mismatch, you would think that if you had a class of gross income in which in a particular year there was both revenues and R&amp;D expenses, well, in that situation there's no temporal mismatch.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.168" offset="14260057">They would at least allow you to allocate those R&amp;D expenses to that revenue in that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.199" offset="14276149">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.419" offset="14277089">Even if there's revenue in a class of gross income in a particular year, they still insist that those R&amp;D expenses be spread across all of the income in that SIC code.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.074" offset="14315646">Now, I want to mention St. Jude, because in this case we're dealing with airplanes and airplanes, and while the... the costs are specifically allocated only to particular programs, it gets a little more complicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.774" offset="14362457">But look at St. Jude.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.234" offset="14368309">In St. Jude, you had a manufacturer who was exporting artificial heart valves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.703" offset="14386176">That's all it was doing, is manufacturing and exporting artificial heart valves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.068" offset="14399656">In the same year, it was engaging in R&amp;D for insulin pumps, and for pacemakers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.216" offset="14424211">The Government insisted that the export income from the sale of those heart valves be reduced, and that the DISC benefit be reduced because of the R&amp;D spent on these other products that obviously had no basis or relevance to the sale of the heart valve simply because they were all within the broad... same broad SIC code.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.126" offset="14503832">And I should say, Justice Kennedy, the Ninth Circuit's opinion I think is somewhat unintelligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.510" offset="14525461">The... the part that you... you referred to, we all stumbled over because it makes no sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.186" offset="14552106">The more narrowly... the more narrowly you define your classes of gross income, the more that... that costs will be directly allocated to more than one class of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.443" offset="14589096">It's not a question of anything being indirectly allocated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.994" offset="14599336">And there's no default rule at issue here either because all of our costs are directly allocable to specific programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.695" offset="14626189">That's all we ask that we be allowed to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.814" offset="14634653">We ask that the judgment in the Ninth Circuit be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.927" offset="14643117">Thank you.</text>
