            <text syncTime="1592.726" offset="6518205">Let me just mention one other part of the guideposts which I think are very relevant here, and that is comparable penalties for comparable misconduct, and here it is uncontroverted that the penalty that the Utah courts or the Utah system could have placed on State Farm for an act, for a single act of bad faith failure to settle, which was at stake here, was $10,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.794" offset="6626457">Yet when the Utah Supreme Court examined that guidepost from the Court, it looked at the scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.430" offset="6661043">It looked at all of the nationwide conduct to determine that 1) you could be... you would have to disgorge all your profits or you could be imprisoned, which was not correct anyhow under the Utah statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.476" offset="6721229">But if you restate the guideposts that you have already come down with, and you make it clear that we're talking about conduct that was permitted to the plaintiffs, that we're talking about reasonable ratios that had to do with the plaintiff's wrong, not harm to others, not harm to all of those in Utah... in fact, if you look at the bad faith failure to settle issue, there was no one in the State of Utah that was harmed by that kind of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.177" offset="6847975">There was nobody that was even subject, Justice Breyer, for a short time with execution, and that... and there was no reason, there was no reason to deter that kind of conduct because there was no conduct in the future, after the Campbell case, that that even came close to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.446" offset="6925089">So I think that if you focus on those factors, those guideposts that you elucidated to in Gore, and make them stronger, that would be sufficient for the lower courts to do their job in doing a meaningful... meaningful appellate review, not the kind of review here that was based on questionable conclusions and improper predicates.</text>
