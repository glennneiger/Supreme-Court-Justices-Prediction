            <text syncTime="13.810" offset="206198">58 years ago almost to the day the United States and its allies defeated Nazi Germany and World War II came to an end in Europe.</text>

            <text syncTime="59.316" offset="388219">To achieve these goals in the context of unpaid insurance claims, the President has taken three actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.373" offset="416431">First, the United States has facilitated and encouraged the establishment of the International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims, or ICHEIC.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.871" offset="450495">Second, the United States, with the personal intervention of the President himself, has negotiated agreements with Germany and Austria under which those countries and their insurance companies agreed to provide hundreds of millions of dollars in compensation for unpaid insurance claims and to follow procedures worked out with ICHEIC to process insurance claims in a nonadversarial manner and under relaxed standards of proof, and--</text>

            <text syncTime="193.480" offset="924878">First, Barclay's concerns solely the Foreign Commerce Clause, and the Court said in Barclay's that Congress has primacy under the Foreign Commerce Clause, and it read the record in that case to conclude that Congress had acquiesced in or approved what California was trying to do in the area of taxation, so there was no suggestion that what California was trying to do in that case prevented the Federal Government from speaking with one voice in the area of foreign commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.390" offset="1028532">There's nothing, to begin with, comparable in this case to suggest that Congress has done anything to authorize California to engage in regulation of foreign insurance policies involving foreign companies and foreign beneficiaries.</text>

            <text syncTime="265.391" offset="1212539">First, the Holocaust Act, the Federal Holocaust Act was passed before the HVIRA, so it could not in any way be read as acquiescing in or approving anything that California was doing in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.981" offset="1266874">Secondly, and Mr. Kneedler will, I think, speak to this, the executive agreement did not expressly preempt any claims, because these were claims largely by foreign nationals against foreign companies, and the President did not believe it would be appropriate to extinguish all of those claims, but we're not dealing in this case with claims by individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.914" offset="1350674">We're dealing with actions by a State which interfere with what the President himself has said are his goals in an area, a very sensitive area of foreign affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.993" offset="1390903">And this case is not like... this case is much stronger than Zschernig, because in Zschernig, the Federal Government had done nothing in the area.</text>

            <text syncTime="367.684" offset="1621721">What the Court essentially said, I think, in Zschernig is that there is a field of foreign affairs where, even if the United States Government has done nothing, the States cannot enter.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.919" offset="1654635">This is a case that I think gets much more clearly analogous to conflict preemption.</text>

            <text syncTime="1715.351" offset="7012349">The Constitution assigns responsibility to the National Government for foreign relations and foreign commerce because any retaliation or any adverse impact will be felt by the Nation as a whole, not by the State that... that triggers it, and this is a point that the Court has made in Japan Lines and numerous cases over the years, and this case illustrates that, because what is going on here is complicating.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.416" offset="7104614">It is an impediment with our relations with European countries at a very sensitive time, when you have one State who... that is not participating in all of those efforts and doesn't have to balance the... the insult that might arise from a statute like this against all of the other issues that are on the United States' plate in dealing with foreign Governments at a particular time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.785" offset="7182145">This is the very reason, that the States don't have enough information and the full responsibility and the National Government has to look out for the interests of the Nation as a whole, why one State may not thrust itself into foreign policy like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.004" offset="7230942">The due process and foreign commerce arguments are very complementary of that because they impose independent limitations on a State thrusting its regulatory power outside of not only its own borders but in this case outside the Nation's borders to, again, regulate through disclosure information about insurance policies in other countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.673" offset="7309623">The very fact that Germany and California insurance regulations generally maintain privacy of insurance information shows that questions of privacy and disclosure are matters of regulation.</text>
