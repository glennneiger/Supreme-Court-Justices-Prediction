            <text syncTime="59.800" offset="389789">Dastar discovered that an old TV show made by Time Inc. was in the public domain because Fox neglected to renew the copyright.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.079" offset="426883">Dastar adapted the public domain show at considerable expense to make it into a war narrative as opposed to Eisenhower's story.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.190" offset="467321">Dastar's product did not refer to Time Inc. Dastar's product also did not refer to respondents who had their own competitive video of the same TV show.</text>

            <text syncTime="126.135" offset="655089">As I... as I understood it, it wasn't the omission of Fox, but the addition of your people.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.089" offset="710886">In other words, it wasn't the failure to give credit to respondents, but it was petitioner's taking credit for it that was what the lower courts thought was wrong.</text>

            <text syncTime="156.179" offset="775252">Taking the lower courts in ascending order, on page 53a of the cert petition, the language is that the court finds that defendant's failure to identify the television series and the book is misleading to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.479" offset="832512">And then at the Ninth Circuit level, on page 3a of the petition, the language is that Dastar copied, et cetera, and marketed it without attribution to Fox.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.143" offset="883085">Neither court, Justice Ginsburg, examined Dastar's credits, affirmative credits, for accuracy, for whether they registered with the consumers, for misleadingness or falsity in any way.</text>

            <text syncTime="226.773" offset="1057688">The entire phrase... and pardon my truncation of it... on page 3a is that Dastar copied substantially the entire Crusade in Europe series created by Twentieth Century Fox, labeled the resulting product with a different name, and marketed it without attribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.102" offset="1122994">The name Dastar put on it, instead of Crusade in Europe, was World War II Campaigns in Europe.</text>

            <text syncTime="1630.370" offset="6672029">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.722" offset="6685404">This is not a case about copying.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.289" offset="6695748">It's a case about deception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.779" offset="6701704">No one is disputing that someone has the right to copy works when they're no longer protected by copyright or patent, but as this Court has long recognized in decisions like Bonita Boats, Sears, and Compco, that doesn't give you the right to create consumer confusion in how you label such works.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.477" offset="6776519">This, I should correct, is not a case about a work that's actually in the public domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.192" offset="6799298">Since the Ninth Circuit decision, as we've explained in our brief, we retried the work for hire issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.300" offset="6819778">The district court once again affirmed her previous summary judgment decision that the work was work for hire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.722" offset="6841407">So the underlying book by General Eisenhower is, in fact, still protected by copyright, though they intend to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.319" offset="6863872">In any case, here Dastar violated the Lanham Act by advertising, packaging, titling, and crediting Crusade in Europe in a manner intentionally designed to give the false impression that it was an original product originally created by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.731" offset="6933463">And Dastar knew, moreover, that consumer confusion was likely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.434" offset="6952271">Norman Andersen, Dastar's President, admitted that a consumer would not be happy to have purchased a copy of Campaigns if he or she already had a copy of Crusade.</text>

            <text syncTime="3053.060" offset="12362752">And as Judge Posner in the Louis Vuitton opinion, discussed in our brief, discusses the enhanced damages, and, in fact, damages of any type, are particularly proper in cases such as this where there's a risk of surreptitious infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.898" offset="12418132">And it's not easy to detect reverse passing off.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.406" offset="12428163">You could have easily have a situation where someone would rather... a rational, economic actor would rather lose the profits on a particular item if... if they can get their entire stream of... of business going forward.</text>

            <text syncTime="3107.431" offset="12580300">That is why Congress has enacted the kind of damages provisions it has under the Lanham Act which I think are singularly suited for just this type of case where it's difficult to show actual damages in any given way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.139" offset="12635157">I'll note, though, that the court in our case did specifically find that we did suffer actual damages and they did not appeal from that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3537.190" offset="14299366">The... the answer under the specific, myopic section we're looking at that it is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.572" offset="14324862">That would not be assertable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.706" offset="14329355">It would be redressable under, arguably, subsection (B) and we may differ from the SG with respect to commercial advertising and promotion and whether a point of sale labeling qualifies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.294" offset="14387765">And under a lot of consumer protection statutes in the States as well as the Federal Trade Act, the... the second point that I promised responds, I believe, to Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.789" offset="14437711">I wanted to add to the answer to the question yes, this would be a copyrightable derivative work, the observation that the copyright defines proper credits for derivative works.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.602" offset="14484940">It tells owners of derivative works who may be designated as the copyright proprietor, and the law there is that the owner of a derivative work, such as Dastar, may use its name.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.512" offset="14540633">It doesn't have to refer to the names of owners of preexisting works.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.518" offset="14560591">So what we have with the suggestion of respondents is a kind of dual series of credits, proper credits under the Copyright Act, and then authorial credits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.834" offset="14605939">I... I would suggest another example in response to Justice Scalia's question, it can become quite burdensome.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.979" offset="14634465">You know, for a very highly complex, iterative product like a car, you might have 300 pages of credits in the owner's manual before you even get to how do you turn on the key under the alternative universe of credits that is completely different from the derivative work credits required by the Copyright Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3699.068" offset="14946785">Where both parties state their names as manufacturer, the consumer could be quite happy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3706.079" offset="14974893">He could say Dastar's cost one-fifth of what Fox's did and recommend it to all of his friends.</text>
            <text syncTime="3712.215" offset="14999448">So while there might be confusion in the literal sense, it might actually be salutary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3718.573" offset="15024839">And the efficiency of that type of consumer decision is really what putting the name of the manufacturer on enables the consumer to do.</text>
