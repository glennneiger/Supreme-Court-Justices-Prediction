            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="85382">I also have the opinion to announce in a case called Khanh Phuong Nguyen and Tuyet Mai Thi Phan against the United States has come to us from the Island of Guam.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.542" offset="155495">This also is a case from the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.871" offset="168765">The petitioners were tried, convicted, and sentenced to lengthy prison terms on federal narcotics charges in the District Court of Guam.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.488" offset="203246">They appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.543" offset="219547">The panel that was convened to decide their appeals included two judges of the Ninth Circuit who are life-renured Article III Judges and also Chief Judge Munson of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands who sat by designation.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.437" offset="283077">That Court like the District Court of Guam is not an Article III Court but an Article IV Territorial Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.548" offset="311498">Unlike an Article III Judge who enjoys life tenure and may remain in office during good behavior, a judge of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands serves for a term of ten years and the President may remove him from office for a good cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.585" offset="379625">Before argument of their appeal, petitioners made no objects to Chief Judge Munson’s inclusion on the Ninth Circuit panel.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.582" offset="411704">After the Court of Appeals affirmed their convictions and sentences, however, petitioners sought writs of certiorari presenting the question whether the decision of the Ninth Circuit should be invalidated because of Chief Judge Munson’s participation in the consideration and decision of their appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.833" offset="480667">We granted certiorari and for reasons stated in an opinion filed with the Clerk we vacate the judgments of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.941" offset="513059">Section 292(a) of the Judicial Code permits the Chief Judge of a Circuit to assign one or more district judges within the Circuit to sit on the Court of Appeals whenever the business of that court so requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.949" offset="569170">Although, the Chief Judge of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands is literally a “district judge” of a court within the Ninth Circuit, it is perfectly clear that his designation to the Court of Appeals was not authorized by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.873" offset="640850">Other provisions within Title 28 together with historical usage demonstrate that the term "district judges" as used in Section 292(a) refers only to those judges who enjoy the protections of Article III.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.695" offset="704066">Accordingly, the Ninth Circuit Panel that included Chief Judge Munson was improperly constituted.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.775" offset="732383">In our view, the defect in Chief Judge Munson’s designation of the Court of Appeals was not merely technical but rather represented a breach of Congress decision to preserve the Article III character of the Courts of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.322" offset="790584">The presence of a quorum of two otherwise qualified judges does not excuse the improper panel designation.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.459" offset="819214">Although, the quorum statute has existed for over a century, we have consistently vacated the judgments of improperly constituted Courts of Appeals despite the presence of a quorum of competent judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.993" offset="869264">It is highly doubtful that two Article III judges on the panel below and any authority deserve as a panel by themselves when the Court was not properly constituted in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.044" offset="917539">We, therefore, return these cases to the Ninth Circuit for a fresh consideration before a properly constituted panel.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.948" offset="945124">The Chief Justice has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Scalia, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer have joined.</text>
