            <text syncTime="1211.064" offset="4992369">This Court's cases have entertained overbreadth challenges as a means of alleviating the chill of First Amendment rights of persons who are not before the Court, but the Court has never entertained overbreadth when the consequence of doing so would be to invalidate a general law that's primarily aimed at conduct and when the person who's raising the challenge did nothing to engage in speech or any expressive activity at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.646" offset="5098636">The costs of an overbreadth challenge, this Court has recognized, are high because they prohibit the Government from enforcing a law against conduct that is not constitutionally protected.</text>

            <text syncTime="2267.227" offset="9216996">So what is the answer then to the overbreadth question?</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.032" offset="9224206">That is, the first question presented in the petition for certiorari, which we granted, asks, as I read it, the question of whether a person who does not engage in expressive conduct at all can ask the court and can succeed in having the court strike down a statute as applied to him for the reason that it might be unconstitutional as applied to other people engaged in expressive conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.273" offset="9333189">The example would be, favoring their side, that you have a gun statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.641" offset="9362655">Any person who possesses a gun is... goes to jail, and the defendant says, well, I did possess a gun and I was trying to rob a bank, but maybe this statute would be applied to a person in a play, in which case it would be too broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.341" offset="9425454">And they say it's like that absurd example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.296" offset="9437261">All right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.277" offset="9441127">Now, why isn't it close enough to the absurd example?</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.737" offset="9455024">They're also arguing that this is a statute that deals with drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.817" offset="9467354">It deals with ordinary trespass.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.328" offset="9477385">Very few of these people want to pamphlet or engage in expressive conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.319" offset="9497342">A handful might, but if they do, let's consider it, when this statute is applied to them, which it never has been in their view.</text>
