            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="9.488" offset="123242">I shall be announcing the judgment of the Court in this case and an opinion in which I am joined by Justice Scalia, Justice Souter, and Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.991" offset="161276">The case is about arbitration clauses in contracts that Green Tree, which is a commercial lender made with many of its customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.195" offset="194086">The South Carolina Supreme Court held two things:  first, it held that the contracts were silent on the question of whether the parties had agreed that arbitration could take the form of class arbitration rather like a class action where the named customer brings a suit representing a host of others.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.809" offset="268483">Then it held that in no circumstances were the contracts are silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.428" offset="283007">The arbitration can proceed as class arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.752" offset="300248">We granted certiorari to determine whether the state court's decision is consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.954" offset="329087">Now, four of us, anyway got stuck at the threshhold.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.791" offset="344447">We thought that the questions, whether the contracts are silent about class arbitration or whether instead as Green Tree said, they forbid it, is a threshhold question, and we think that was not really a question for the court, that was a question for the arbitrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.515" offset="411320">So, we conclude that on that question, the arbitrator should have decided it independently but he did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.515" offset="435353">So, we remand the case so that he can.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.446" offset="447056">Now, the judgment of the Court of the South Carolina is therefore vacated, and it is remanded after further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.468" offset="479134">Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment and dissenting in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.741" offset="500241">The Chief Justice has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice O'Connor and Justice Kennedy joined and Justice Thomas has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
