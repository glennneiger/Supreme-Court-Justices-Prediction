            <text syncTime="189.174" offset="909384">I mean, it's quite a fine point, but I guess I wouldn't say necessarily that what he meant has anything to do with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.559" offset="942925">That is, he said certain things in the world, and if he had a secret meaning, we don't care nor does the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.472" offset="970615">But having said these particular things in the world, then the question would be, can the Michigan Supreme Court... does it... did it... it characterized those things, and it said as a matter of Michigan law, those things said in the world do not amount to a judgment of acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.543" offset="1046892">So then I guess we would... if that's the way to look at it, then we would have the problem of deciding whether, even though as a matter of Michigan law, those events that took place in the world do not amount to a judgment of acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.833" offset="1108019">Nonetheless, for purposes of the Federal Double Jeopardy Clause, do they amount to a judgment of acquittal?</text>
            <text syncTime="247.224" offset="1141664">Those would be two legal questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="297.487" offset="1342703">The court says, nothing?</text>
            <text syncTime="300.215" offset="1353570">Well, impression at this time is that there's not been shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.187" offset="1369452">And then at page 18 of the same exhibit, the court actually schedules an 8:30 motion the following day when the prosecutor in this case... the assistant prosecutor asked the court if he could be heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.002" offset="1444685">And the judge said, I'll be glad to hear you.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.574" offset="1459000">And in fact, the court had originally scheduled the attorneys to be there at 10:00 and then changed the time for them to show up before the jury came back.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.255" offset="1497766">And lastly I think it shows that no one who was involved in this case at the trial level actually believed that a final ruling had been made.</text>

            <text syncTime="1102.513" offset="4562765">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.970" offset="4636639">It's a long-established background principle that mid-trial rulings are inherently subject to reconsideration by the trial court itself until the end of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.265" offset="4669762">That is especially so where, as here, a party promptly seeks reconsideration which necessarily renders the initial ruling inconclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.088" offset="4701109">That rule reflects four important legal and practical considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.345" offset="4718141">First, trial courts often must rule swiftly without the benefit of extended briefing, argument, or deliberation or even a copy of the trial transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.997" offset="4756698">They could not operate justly absent the opportunity for reconsideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.912" offset="4772371">Second, the Double Jeopardy Clause affords the government a full and fair opportunity to make its case in the first tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.018" offset="4800793">In the context of trial, that full and fair opportunity includes reconsideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.510" offset="4822735">Indeed, reconsideration is particularly important precisely because the government very often cannot appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2993.443" offset="12126468">Because what... what AEDPA requires is not to look at the decisions of the lower courts, but to look to see whether the decision of the Michigan Supreme Court was a clearly unreasonable application.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.883" offset="12172234">Now, I should point out, first of all, on that issue whether a judge can take back a directed verdict, the Michigan Supreme Court did not rule against us, in fact indicated that it agreed with our position that a judge may not take back a directed verdict if he had... if he has actually rendered one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.998" offset="12228763">And the Michigan Court of Appeals ruled the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.863" offset="12240153">But if you look at the split of authority, it's a very striking split of authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.108" offset="12265126">The cases that cite and rely upon Smalis on very similar situations where there is a directed verdict, a partial directed verdict during an ongoing trial, so the trial continues, and then the judge attempts to take back the directed verdict at some point later in the trial, those courts that have applied Smalis have, with one exception, held that the judge cannot do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.672" offset="12351434">Those courts that have gone the other way have almost uniformly relied on a Second Circuit decision, United States versus LoRusso, which says that there is no problem with doing that because it does not result in a second trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.842" offset="12404097">And what this Court could not have been more clear about in Smalis is that a double jeopardy is violated not only if a reversal of a directed verdict would result in a second trial, but if it would result in a continuation of the same trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.160" offset="12457387">And that is why this case is constitutionally indistinguishable from Smalis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.445" offset="12474523">The only difference between this case and Smalis is that instead of going to a higher court, as was attempted by... in the Tenth Circuit in United States versus Ellison, what happened there is that the prosecution... there was a partial directed verdict, exactly as in this case.</text>
