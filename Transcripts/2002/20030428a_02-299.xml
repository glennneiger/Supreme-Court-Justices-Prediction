            <text syncTime="1018.297" offset="4219061">Under Nantahala and Mississippi Power &amp; Light, the regulation of wholesale rates for electric energy in interstate commerce is exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.038" offset="4262006">Federal jurisdiction is necessary to ensure that multistate utilities, like Entergy and other utilities, are able to carry out their FERC-regulated transactions, to plan and carry out those transactions without the interference of potentially conflicting State regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.281" offset="4323028">The facts of this case highlight the need for exclusive Federal regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.898" offset="4337448">The dispute in this case involves the correct allocation of costs incurred for the common benefit of five utilities in four different States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.091" offset="4370257">The Louisiana commission believed that the costs allocated to Entergy Louisiana were too high, but the consequence of the Louisiana commission's rate decision would be to reallocate those costs to ratepayers in Texas, Arkansas, and Mississippi or else to render them trapped and entirely unrecoverable.</text>
