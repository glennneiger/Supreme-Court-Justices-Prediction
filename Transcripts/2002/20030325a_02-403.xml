            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="137440">We'll hear argument now in No. 02-403, the Federal Election Commission v. Christine Beaumont.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.208" offset="170250">Mr. Clement.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="9.488" stopTime="96.396">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="9.488" offset="175370">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.695" offset="188118">This Court's campaign finance cases consistently emphasize the fundamental distinction between contributions and expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.366" offset="218838">Direct transfers of cash to a candidate pose unique risks of the appearance of corruption or the threat of actual corruption while, at the same time, imposing less significant interference with First Amendment values.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.154" offset="274008">And so this Court's jurisprudence consistently recognizes that there is less rigorous scrutiny on limitations on contributions relative to limitations on expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.224" offset="318312">The court below lost sight of that fundamental dichotomy.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.846" offset="332731">It held that corporations of the type that this Court exempted from the general limitations on corporate expenditures in Massachusetts Citizens for Life were equally exempt from the broad prohibitions on corporate contributions to candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.568" offset="391664">That reasoning ignores this Court's decision in Massachusetts Citizens for Life itself, which specifically distinguished between the expenditures and contributions of nonprofit corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.761" offset="440460">More fundamentally, the decision below ignores this Court's decision in National Right to Work Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.271" offset="466478">There this Court held that the broad limitations on corporate contributions and the specific limitations on solicitation embedded in that broad prohibition were constitutional against a First Amendment challenge.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="96.396" stopTime="107.741">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="96.396" offset="523007">Mr. Clement, the Government does... does not challenge the exemption of this not-for-profit corporation from expenditure limitations?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="107.741" stopTime="165.228">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="107.741" offset="568356">That's right, Justice Scalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.393" offset="574939">The court below addressed both an expenditure issue and a prohibition issue with respect to contributions, and the Government only took up the prohibition on contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.146" offset="614018">So that is the only issue before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.797" offset="620601">I think it's important, though, to understand that that is a distinction that the court below placed insufficient emphasis on because that is a distinction between contributions and expenditures that underlies the last quarter century of this Court's campaign finance jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.584" offset="683713">And in National Right to Work Committee itself, this Court recognized that the broad prohibitions on contributions applied to all corporations, including those like National Right to Work Committee itself that were without great financial resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.144" offset="741913">Nonetheless, in the particular context of corporate contributions to candidates, this Court held that it would not second guess Congress' decision that a broad, prophylactic approach was necessary when corruption was the evil feared.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="165.228" stopTime="175.186">
            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="165.228" offset="798338">Do you think after the decision in Massachusetts... the Massachusetts case, the NRWC would have a right to make independent expenditures?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="175.186" stopTime="313.654">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="175.186" offset="838149">Well, I think it would, Chief Justice Rehnquist, and I think that where I would point to first is your dissent in that case because in that case in your dissent, you made the argument that National Right to Work Committee was essentially the same as Massachusetts Citizens for Life.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.122" offset="901887">And the majority, in responding to that argument, didn't draw any particular distinction between National Right to Work Committee and Massachusetts Citizens for Life, but rather drew a firm distinction between the level of scrutiny that applies to limitations on contributions and the level of scrutiny that applies to limitations on expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.674" offset="976075">So I would read that decision as saying that the critical distinction is not the differences among the types of corporations with respect to contribution bans, but is the fact that contribution bans are much more readily approved under First Amendment analysis than expenditure bans.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.156" offset="1038038">And National Right to Work Committee obviously wasn't the last word on that subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.136" offset="1053920">This Court reaffirmed the validity of a broad, prophylactic approach to corporate contributions both in National Conservative Political Action Committee and in Massachusetts Citizens for Life itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.090" offset="1101776">Particularly, in light of Massachusetts Citizens for Life, a ban on corporate contributions by nonprofits does not impose significant burdens on First Amendment interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.130" offset="1149946">In the particular context of this type of corporation, the corporation is free to engage in unlimited spending on elections through the corporate form, and the individual respondents are free to give unlimited contributions to North Carolina Right to Life.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.875" offset="1220895">In addition and equally important, the individual members of North Carolina Right to Life are free to give contributions to the candidates of their choice up to the constitutionally valid contribution limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.293" offset="1270527">Accordingly, this case doesn't involve the right to associate together or the right to associate with candidates of someone's individual choosing, but only the right to assemble together collectively to give money to candidates of an organization's collective choosing.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.221" offset="1338237">And even that rather attenuated First Amendment interest is only affected to the extent that a corporation must direct its contributions through a separate segregated fund with enhanced disclosure and reporting and bookkeeping requirements.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="313.654" stopTime="327.771">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="313.654" offset="1392049">Why... why is that an attenuated First Amendment right?</text>
            <text syncTime="316.310" offset="1402602">Isn't that the right that enables the formation of political parties, people forming together in order to collectively give money to particular candidates?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="327.771" stopTime="335.745">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="327.771" offset="1448473">Well, certainly in... in the first point, parties are subject to a different type of regulation under the campaign finance laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.785" offset="1476477">But secondly--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="335.745" stopTime="352.157">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="335.745" offset="1480343">Well, it may well be, but... but I... I wouldn't shrug off as inconsequential the importance of individuals being able to band together to support individual candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.107" offset="1533842">That's the whole basis for our... our party system.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="352.157" stopTime="641.563">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="352.157" offset="1546067">--And... and I don't want to suggest that there's no First Amendment interest on the other side of... of the argument in this case, but what I did mean to suggest is that interest is less significant than the interest in individuals banding together to make expenditures that they might otherwise not be able to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.717" offset="1612209">And I think even in the party context, this Court recognized that distinction in the Colorado Republican cases where it held that limitations on what the... the party can spend to support a candidate are not subject to limitation, but what... but there... but there are valid limitations on what the party can contribute to a candidate of its choosing.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.579" offset="1691726">Now, in contrast to the rather minimal First Amendment interests that are interfered with by section 441b, it plays an important role in safeguarding the integrity of the election process.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.002" offset="1741358">This Court in... in National Right to Work Committee already has recognized that corporate contributions pose a risk of the reality and appearance of corruption and that a broad, prophylactic limitation on all corporations, including those without great financial resources, is an appropriate response to that threat.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.644" offset="1815964">All corporations, regardless of their size, also pose risks of circumvention and of undermining the workability of candidate disclosure requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.944" offset="1857133">As this Court recognized in Cedric Kushner Promotions against King, the whole point of a corporation, its basic purpose and fundamental reason for... for existing is to create legal separateness between the individuals that form and run the corporation and the artificial corporate entity itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.251" offset="1926410">Giving such an artificial entity the right to contribute in its own name, independent of the individuals that underlie the corporation, obviously poses a distinct risk to a campaign finance system that is based largely on individual contribution limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.208" offset="1986178">Section 441b addresses that risk by requiring that those contributions be made through a segregated fund subject to enhanced bookkeeping and disclosure requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.007" offset="2025466">Those bookkeeping and disclosure requirements, in turn, make the campaign disclosure forms that individual candidates have to file work in a meaningful fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.377" offset="2062873">If those candidate disclosure forms simply revealed that the candidate received money from an artificial entity with either an ambiguous name or what this Court in Citizens Against Rent Control v. Berkeley termed a seductive name that tends to conceal the true identity and true source of the funds, then those campaign finance forms... or disclosure forms will not provide meaningful information.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.842" offset="2148764">If, on the other hand, 441b makes the underlying corporations use a segregated fund that discloses the individual sources of the contributions, then the disclosure forms can work in a meaningful fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.126" offset="2197874">I think it bears emphasis, as this Court recognized in Massachusetts Citizens for Life, that the distinction between contributions and expenditures applies with full force in the context of nonprofit organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.377" offset="2242909">A limitation on expenditures can prevent an organization's members, who might otherwise not have the resources to reach a certain audience, to pool their resources together to reach that audience.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.227" offset="2286273">There is no comparable function or benefit from the pooling of individual candidate contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.948" offset="2309156">The individual candidates themselves can perform that pooling function by assembling together candidate contributions of whatever size in order to reach an audience or to engage in political speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.031" offset="2353564">The intermediate pooling function that the nonprofit corporation serves can only benefit by either circumventing the individual contribution requirements or assembling an aggregate contribution of a sufficient size to potentially capture the attention of a candidate for purposes of a quid pro quo.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.608" offset="2419811">To be sure, the same provisions of the campaign finance laws allow corporations to assemble funds in... in aggregate amounts through a segregated fund, but only with the additional safeguards that are imposed, including enhanced disclosure requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.373" offset="2482922">Congress, in adopting section 441b, drew an important distinction between corporations and their ability to contribute and individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.553" offset="2523569">In the expenditure context, the limitations on corporate expenditures stand in stark contrast to the general right of individuals to engage in unlimited independent expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.465" offset="2563275">But no one has a right to engage in unlimited corporate... in unlimited contributions to candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.986" offset="2585322">Congress addresses the threat of individual contributions through dollar amounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.310" offset="2602668">It addresses the distinct risks of corporate contributions through the requirement of a segregated fund, higher limits, and enhanced disclosure requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.579" offset="2639657">Respondents effectively ask this Court to disregard and second guess Congress' decision to treat corporations differently from individuals for purposes of candidate contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.685" offset="2684170">With respect, I think essentially respondents ask this Court to treat North Carolina Right--</text>

            <text syncTime="811.255" offset="3382371">But I do think it's easy to exaggerate the burdens that are imposed in setting up a segregated fund.</text>

            <text syncTime="838.895" offset="3492921">And I think it's no accident that in the four cases that this Court has had that involved a nonprofit corporation, National Right to Work Committee, Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Austin against Michigan Chamber of Commerce, and this case, all four of those nonprofits had already set up segregated funds before the case got to this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="950.384" offset="3938883">And in particular, if you look at footnote 13 of the Massachusetts Citizens for Life decision, the Court there specifically said that it understood that Massachusetts Citizens for Life would continue to be subjected to the National Right to Work Committee regime for purposes of its contributions, and it was talking about the fact that it didn't have... that Massachusetts Citizens for Life, for example, didn't have shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.673" offset="4024042">But it was quick to... to reinforce that that didn't mean that it didn't have members for purposes of National Right to Work Committee that it could solicit, subject of course to the overall limit that it could not give direct contributions to candidates.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="2783.829" offset="11272709">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.151" offset="11285979">Let me begin with the distinction that respondents rely on between limits on contributions and prohibitions on contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.583" offset="11315758">Even if there is something to that distinction... and I rather doubt there is for some of the reasons unearthed by Justice Stevens' colloquy with... with counsel for respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.657" offset="11352016">Even if that were a valid distinction, this case does not involve an absolute prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.356" offset="11370824">This Court, both in Massachusetts Citizens for Life and Austin, and in fact, much earlier in Pipefitters, made clear that the limitations on corporate and labor union contributions in section 441b are not a, quote, absolute prohibition, but rather just a limitation on contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.748" offset="11440415">The availability of the segregated funds to make the contributions is another way of making this a limitation, a particular limitation designed for the unique risks of artificial entities like corporations and labor unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.199" offset="11494227">And I think any effort to distinguish the discussion in Massachusetts Citizens for Life and its distinguished... distinctions between contributions and expenditures on the grounds that a prohibition might be different just doesn't work because both Massachusetts Citizens for Life and National Right to Work Committee involved this very provision, section 441b.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.453" offset="11575207">So whatever there might be in the case of an absolute prohibition on somebody's right to make contributions, 441b either isn't that or isn't that in... in a constitutionally relevant way after this Court's decisions in Massachusetts Citizens for Life and National Right to Work Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.050" offset="11641558">Some discussion was had about fine distinctions that potentially could be drawn between the American Association of Retired Persons, National Right to Work Committee, Massachusetts Citizens for Life, and North Carolina Citizens Right to Life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.563" offset="11695683">The point of section 441b in the contribution context is that Congress has not found a need to draw those kind of fine distinctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.480" offset="11727344">MCFL itself, of course, drew some of those distinctions in the contribution context... in the expenditure context, rather, but drew a distinction between contributions in light of the inherently greater risk of corruption from contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.853" offset="11780842">Another suggestion was made that perhaps there is a seemingly less restrictive alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.331" offset="11802681">As with independent expenditures made by nonprofit associations, perhaps contributions that are made to the association with the purpose of them being used for contributions to candidates could be disclosed.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="2929.785" offset="11856493">Have we actually held, Mr. Clement, that in regulating contributions, the Government must find the least restrictive means?</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="2938.106" offset="11889825">No, and to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.489" offset="11895363">This Court has not held that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.791" offset="11900588">It did not apply a least restrictive alternative analysis in National Right to Work Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.523" offset="11919500">In the California Medical Association case, a plurality of the Court, in fact, affirmatively held that the least restrictive alternative was not required in the context of contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.718" offset="11960251">So I don't think there is that requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.707" offset="11968193">But I want to address the... the supposed less restrictive alternative precisely because I believe that less restrictive alternative is illusory because the suggestion is that... that individuals could say... could disclose when they give a contribution to a nonprofit organization for the purpose of a contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.374" offset="12038932">Well, if that's going to have the effect of avoiding the circumvention rationale, I wonder whether people are really going to volunteer the information that the contribution to the nonprofit is for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.057" offset="12081564">And additionally, even if that is a permissible way and would be enforceable in the real political world, that really doesn't give you much of a different result than what Congress has specifically provided for with the segregated fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.978" offset="12137257">And indeed, the segregated fund actually is responsive to the kind of First Amendment associational interests that underlie this Court's concerns in Buckley and even going back to NAACP against Button.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.081" offset="12185740">The concern is that disclosure requirements imposed on organizations could be a backhanded way to get at membership lists.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.817" offset="12212699">The segregated fund prevents that by keeping the membership lists and the organization itself separate from the political activity of the organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.072" offset="12245718">Indeed, if Congress hadn't provided for segregated funds as a requirement for all corporations, but simply made that available, I would think that many nonprofit corporations would avail themselves of that option precisely to avoid the interference with associational interests as in cases like NAACP against Button.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.684" offset="12312173">The last point I'd like to talk about is simply this idea that again underlies much of respondents' arguments that because there is no threat from expenditures to these types of corporations, there is therefore no threat to these type of corporations engaging in corporate contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.793" offset="12376539">If that analysis were applied across the board, it would undermine the entirety of this Court's campaign finance jurisprudence which is based on the fundamental recognition that contributions involve greater risks than expenditures, and... and expenditures, therefore, are largely unregulated because they are... presumably do not pose as great a risk as contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.781" offset="12456473">If there are no further questions, I'd like the court below reversed.</text>
