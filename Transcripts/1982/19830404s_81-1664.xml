            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="8.212" offset="125114">This is a case that comes to us from the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.006" offset="144235">It arises out of an unlawful work stoppage that occurred when employees of Metropolitan Edison Company, members of the Electrical Workers union refused to cross a picket line established by a different union.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.896" offset="207870">The collective bargaining agreement contained a no-strike clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.046" offset="224484">Officials of the company, relying on this clause demanded that the officers of the Electrical Workers union cross the picket line.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.680" offset="262936">They declined to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.813" offset="271504">As a result of this refusal, the company imposed discipline on the Electrical Workers officers more severe than that imposed on whether union members who had participated in the unlawful work stoppage.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.432" offset="337960">Meanwhile, the union officials had negotiated a settlement between the pickets and the company and this ended the unlawful strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.499" offset="382263">The union then filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board charging that the company had discriminated against its officials in violation of Section 8(a)(3) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.109" offset="436702">The Board agreed and the Court of Appeals enforced the Board's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.232" offset="457182">We also agree that in the absence of an explicit contractual duty, an employer may not assume that a union official has a duty to enforce a no-strike clause by complying with the employer's directions.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.102" offset="528653">We think the Board's view that the enhanced penalty imposed on the union officials would violate Section 8(a)(3) is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.429" offset="577973">It is consistent with the principle that neither the representatives of management or of labor should be coerced in the performance of their official duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.430" offset="621963">Although the union may waive this statutory protection, the bargaining agreement in this case does not establish clearly and unmistakably that the union intended to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.151" offset="676820">We therefore affirm unanimously the decision of the Court of Appeals.</text>
