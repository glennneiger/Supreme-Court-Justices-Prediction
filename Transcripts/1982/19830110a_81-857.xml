            <text syncTime="60.142" offset="397143">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="63.875" offset="412085">This case is in many respects a companion case to last term's decision in Plyler versus Doe.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.075" offset="436849">It is another attempt by the state of Texas to exclude unwanted Mexican children from the schools of Texas, and to deter them from migrating to the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.572" offset="478854">What the state does here is far less defensible than what it did in Plyler versus Doe.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.600" offset="502991">The children that the state is depriving of an education in this case are, in fact, United States citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.161" offset="533188">Citizens whose parents are Mexican nationals.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.394" offset="546145">But these citizen children have an absolute constitutional right to establish their homes in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.859" offset="576029">And the mechanism used by the state to exclude these children from school is to define them as non-residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.731" offset="607480">The statute at issue here states that a child who lives apart from his parents for the purpose of obtaining an education is a non-resident if he is moved apart from his parents in order to obtain an education.</text>

            <text syncTime="131.113" offset="681041">It is set out... Your Honor, I believe it's on page 2 of the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.862" offset="711970">It's subsection (d), the section challenged here.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.344" offset="725972">But of course, it's precisely children like Roberto Morales and other children whose parents are Mexican nationals who must move apart from their parents in order to obtain the education they need if they are to participate in American society and exercise their birthright, their American citizenship.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="162.180" offset="805280">Well certainly, the statute can serve some legitimate purposes, can't it?</text>
            <text syncTime="166.662" offset="823252">I don't suppose that wealthy parents can live in a poor school district that doesn't do much in the way of taxing property and have a constitutional right to have their child live with a step-sister in a very wealthy school district.</text>

            <text syncTime="185.391" offset="898171">Well, there are several answers to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.468" offset="910396">If the child is simply commuting from one district to another and, in fact, returns at night to live with its parents, then--</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="195.681" offset="939236">No, I'm assuming that the parents don't want to pay the school taxes in the high taxing district, but they want their child to be educated there and they're perfectly willing to have the child take up legal residence with a step-sister.</text>
          </turn>

            <text syncTime="208.679" offset="991271">--If the child, in fact, moves and establishes a residence with a sister in another school district and residence is the criteria for admission to school, then I should think that that child would have the right to attend school.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.110" offset="1041009">But I would point out that this statute does more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.922" offset="1052294">The problem with the example you're giving... and I think it is the essential problem of the case... is this notion that if a child has a choice between two districts, there's something somehow wrong with him choosing one district over another.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.399" offset="1102135">Well, setting that problem aside for the moment, that's not what this statute prohibits.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="240.943" offset="1120316">But doesn't the state have a perfectly legitimate interest in seeing that what you say the statute doesn't prohibit doesn't happen?</text>

            <text syncTime="247.818" offset="1147797">The state has an interest in protecting its schools from excessive problems of migration, but it can't do that by prohibiting migration.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.470" offset="1194400">And I think that the problem that you pose is really more in the minds of the school administrators than the evidence in this case would demonstrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.653" offset="1231180">In fact, several states such as New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Connecticut, and I also believe Colorado, have statutes that would allow parents to do just what you have said in your example here.</text>

            <text syncTime="280.351" offset="1277991">But the fact that New York and Pennsylvania might allow parents to do this doesn't mean that Texas, under the Constitution, has to allow it, does it?</text>

            <text syncTime="287.691" offset="1307353">Well, I would argue that if the child has a right to travel and a right to establish his home in another district, then he can.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.281" offset="1341730">But--</text>

            <text syncTime="296.859" offset="1344029">You would argue, then, that if I'm a parent and live in a very wealthy school district and my 14-year old child... rather, I'm a parent who lives in a poor district but I want my child to go to a district where there is a good deal better education because of a high tax rate but I don't want to move into that district because I don't want to pay the high tax rate, so I simply farm my child out to a step-sister in the high tax rate district, that the state can't prevent that under the Constitution, because a 14-year old child has a right to travel from one school district to another?</text>

            <text syncTime="335.358" offset="1497943">But, Your Honor, understand that in this case, Texas doesn't prohibit what you're saying.</text>

            <text syncTime="348.449" offset="1550396">Perhaps, again, where there is a choice between school districts, there might be some grounds for limitation, although I think if there are going to be limitations on a child's constitutional rights as opposed to an adult's, it must have something intrinsic to do with the child, some disability of the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.582" offset="1610896">But the state of Texas has made clear that it does not care whether children move from one district to another to live with a sister, so long as they can come up with some other reason for doing it.</text>

            <text syncTime="459.417" offset="1994269">So they have no problem with the capacity of the child to establish residence apart from its parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.667" offset="2019242">It simply then takes one class of those children and says you cannot establish residence apart from your parents because you've come for the purpose of obtaining an education.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.193" offset="2061351">And to go back to your question, Justice Rehnquist, the fact that the state may have a legitimate concern about children district-hopping, I believe is the way the respondents referred to it, this statute doesn't stop that.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.623" offset="2131046">If a parent has enough money to obtain a guardianship, or if he can concoct a reason other than the need for an education, then the child can transfer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1775.497" offset="7258569">I think first we probably ought to straighten out the history of this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.556" offset="7274765">It was codified in 1977; however, this is a rule of Texas law that dates back at least to 1905.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.681" offset="7303291">It's a rule of American law that dates back at least to 1851 in what was apparently the first school residence case in the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.190" offset="7333280">It was introduced into jurisprudence by the New Hampshire Supreme Court at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.657" offset="7355223">In 1905, the Texas attorney general's opinion expressly relied on this rule, stating that the child was not entitled to go to school in a little town called Rockdale in central Texas if the main purpose of the child being there was to obtain an education in that district, and this child did not live with parents or guardians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.729" offset="7435471">He equated the main purpose of being there for an education with an ostensible residence as opposed to substantial residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.896" offset="7464101">Just to show the dissimilarity of this rule of law with the rule of law at issue in Plyler versus Doe, some 15 years later while this rule was still in effect in Texas, the Texas attorney general ruled that they also had to admit any illegal aliens in the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.077" offset="7532855">It didn't matter... and you'll find that in the record of the Plyler case, reference to that 1920 decision in the 1975 opinion of the attorney general.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.137" offset="7573084">In 1973, this question recurred... the question in this instant case... recurred several times, right on up until 1973 where the attorney general reviewed all the decision up to date and reiterated that the test for residence in Texas to go to school is not domicile, it's not an intent to remain permanently, it's what is termed a bona fide residence, and a bona fide residence can be acquired apart from a parent or guardian if your purpose for residing in that district and being present in that district is not for the primary purpose of going to school.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.529" offset="7698680">And Justice O'Connor, that is the Texas test of residency and has been now for 77 years at least.</text>

            <text syncTime="3265.291" offset="13217727">But in any event, the motive factually, the district court found the dominant motive was to codify or to provide a statutory definition of residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.441" offset="13250328">Previous to that, it had merely been common law as indicated by the attorney general opinions in the DeLeon court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.394" offset="13278122">Now, we have used in Texas precisely the standard this Court set forth in Vlandis versus Kline for determining bona fide residency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.511" offset="13322635">This purpose test was also used in Sosna versus Iowa, it is used in Starns which was affirmed by this Court, it was set forth in various decisions of the lower courts on the same issues such as the Spriggs case and the Zoben case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.880" offset="13392120">We have used what we believe to be the best system.</text>

            <text syncTime="3322.875" offset="13448023">This also, I would point out, allows us to have a workable system for the education of handicapped children.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.872" offset="13472055">Under a de facto residency approach, which analytically is the only thing one could go to to strike this statute, and a temporary de facto at that, if Houston were to place a child in Austin at a residential facility for the purposes of an education, he's paying $100,000 a year, upon his arrival to Austin he'll become a resident of Austin and Austin will become responsible for that $100,000 a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.847" offset="13567977">It doesn't make a lot of sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.206" offset="13577381">By the same token,... and that is one reason we have the disqualification concerning educational purposes, or that's one end that it serves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.499" offset="13614579">On the other side of the coin, we have things called ICFMRs, Intermediate Care Facilities for the Mentally Retarded, where parents place children; they've never taken the kid to the home district.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.760" offset="13651569">The home district's never had a shot to see if they could provide an appropriate education for this kid, but the kid may be 500 miles across the state in an ICFMR.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.707" offset="13683334">By regulation, we have required the district where that ICFMR is located to provide an education to those children, so long as they are not there for an education, primarily for educational reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.876" offset="13728055">Otherwise, we would have a very difficult time delivering services to those children because the district of responsibility would be 500 miles away and never have seen the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.106" offset="13764940">Our system works very well in Texas for a lot of different reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.667" offset="13787196">It works very well in a number of other areas for a lot of different reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.759" offset="13799631">It's the common law of this country in school residency matters.</text>
