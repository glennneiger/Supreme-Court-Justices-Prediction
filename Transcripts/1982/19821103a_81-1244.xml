            <text syncTime="95.944" offset="530802">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.146" offset="535608">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, as oral argument is presented in this case today, the litigation is in its tenth year.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.954" offset="570926">The only issue remaining for resolution before this Court is one involving the attorneys' fees awarded by the district court and affirmed by the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.044" offset="615229">The case will require an interpretation and application of the Civil Rights Attorneys' Fees Awards Act of 1976, Title 42, Section 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.821" offset="662354">On behalf of Petitioners, I urge the Court to adopt the principle that award of attorneys' fees under the statute should fairly and accurately reflect the extent to which a plaintiff has prevailed on the substantial claims in his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.594" offset="733407">I ask the Court to accept the principle that the Attorneys' Fees Award Act does not compensate a plaintiff in a civil rights case for his failures, and it does not penalize a defendant in a civil rights case for his substantial successes.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.322" offset="804356">On the facts, the district court approved in this case an attorneys' fee award of over $133,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.194" offset="847824">That represented 2,557 principal hours as found by the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.192" offset="871856">Again, that award was affirmed per curium by the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.642" offset="893590">No attempt was made by the district court to proportion the fee to reflect the extent to which the plaintiff succeeded on claims and the extent to which the defendants successfully defended, in effect, demonstrating that no constitutional deprivation had occurred with respect to certain claims in the lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.039" offset="987213">The district court itself found in its opinion relating to fees that the defendants did prevail on some of the issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.252" offset="1028068">Nevertheless, it awarded in practical effect fees for every hour spent by plaintiff's attorneys on the case without respect to whether they prevailed or lost on specific issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.215" offset="1095882">This case involved a comprehensive--</text>

            <text syncTime="249.444" offset="1144888">I think there were a few claims in this case that because they were not abandoned prior to trial had become close to being frivolous by being presented in the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.768" offset="1182086">There were other claims in the case which were unsuccessful which I do not claim to you were frivolous.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.158" offset="1203716">Nevertheless, they were unsuccessful.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.016" offset="1211135">And Congress provided fees for prevailing civil rights litigants, not fees for merely asserting a civil rights claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="279.369" offset="1264529">I think by the time they got to the point in the lawsuit where they were trying to prove that defendants over-relied upon medication in controlling the patients in the forensic unit, that had become frivolous, because their own experts, all of whom had been contacted, employed some years in advance of the case, did not support the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.267" offset="1348121">They all came to the courtroom and testified there was no evidence of overmedication of patients.</text>

            <text syncTime="320.758" offset="1430145">There was also some contemporary Eighth Circuit precedent which dealt with mail issues in the prison context.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.803" offset="1454282">I think their failure to have abandoned that claim and to have presented it at trial when it was clearly... the mail policy was consistent with what was being done--</text>

            <text syncTime="794.676" offset="3325799">For the claims that lost, that would have been an unsuccessful one-issue lawsuit, and no attorneys' fees under any interpretation of the statute can be awarded to a party who does not prevail at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="1523.768" offset="6242109">It is very hard to negotiate claims when the plaintiff's attorney knows that all hours he expends on his total case are going to be compensated, regardless of his success on individual claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="1571.405" offset="6432699">In addition, attorneys' fees do cause a penalty to be levied against defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.636" offset="6465613">I think that was the purpose of Congress in enacting the Attorneys' Fees Award Act, and in the context of other attorneys' fees provisions this Court has found that Congress intended to penalize defendants who deprive others of their civil rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.317" offset="6516291">But when a claim is successfully defended, when there is found to have been no deprivation of anyone's civil rights, why should the defendant be required to accept the burden of his adversary's fees?</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.701" offset="6577835">That is not consistent with that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.575" offset="6589329">Otherwise, the prevailing party language of the statute means nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.918" offset="6618691">Now, again in this case there were truly fractionable claims, claims that could have been one-issue lawsuits which were unsuccessful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.161" offset="6659755">For example, a one-claim lawsuit on the validity of the defendant's mail policy would have been unsuccessful.</text>

            <text syncTime="1636.268" offset="6692147">A one-issue lawsuit on the claim that defendants overmedicated their patients would have been unsuccessful.</text>

            <text syncTime="1644.138" offset="6723598">An unsuccessful lawsuit on the claim that defendant's staff was constitutionally inadequate would have been unsuccessful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.793" offset="6762259">Why should a fee attach to these totally unsuccessful constitutional claims merely because they were under the umbrella of a lawsuit which included some other claims which resulted in limited relief being afforded?</text>

            <text syncTime="2412.903" offset="9798628">Resolution of that question involves a narrow question or issue of statutory construction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2423.275" offset="9840215">The Fees Act is a broad Congressional charter authorizing courts to award a prevailing party a reasonable attorneys' fee as part of costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.425" offset="9880757">Congress accompanied this statute with a substantial legislative history consisting of both the Senate and House report, both of which have been authoritatively cited by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.750" offset="9926106">In the context of attorneys' fee awards, the legislative history is especially instructive in light of this Court's holding in Alyeska that the circumstances under which attorneys' fee awards are to be awarded and the range of discretion of courts in making those awards are matters for Congress to determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.286" offset="10004160">Congress... In the legislative history, Congress anticipated a number of issues which would accompany a fee shifting statute, and provided specific guidance for resolution of those issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.094" offset="10051389">In a section of the legislative history which addresses the method of computing the amount of the fee, Congress explicitly stated what the proper standard was to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.999" offset="10091095">"In computing the fee, counsel for the prevailing party should be compensated, as is traditional with attorneys for fee-paying clients, for all time reasonably expended on a matter. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.102" offset="10139474">Congress provided further direction on this issue by stating that proper fee computation had taken place in two specific cases, the Davis versus County of Los Angeles case and the Stanford Daily versus Zirker case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.893" offset="10206661">Those cases established that the all time reasonably expended standard does not permit apportioning the fee award to only winning claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.482" offset="10245009">In the Davis case, which was a Title 7 suit, defendants had argued for a proportional fee reduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.933" offset="10270818">The court specifically held it was not legally relevant that a certain amount of limited time and effort was devoted to issues which were either not litigated or upon which they were not successful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.897" offset="10318674">Instead, the court looked to the ultimate results achieved, and found that plaintiff was entitled to fees for all time reasonably expended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.440" offset="10352842">In the Stanford Daily case, the court similarly disapproved of a proportionality analysis and rejected defendant's argument that there should be a reduction in fees for the hours expended on unsuccessful work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.513" offset="10409162">The court held that although fees were to be denied for clearly meritless claims, they were to be granted for legal work reasonably calculated to advance their client's interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="3033.478" offset="12280993">Defendants had argued for an automatic across the board reduction in fees, suggesting that the amount of the fee should be tied to the amount of court-ordered relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.644" offset="12321639">The district court properly rejected those suggestions, finding that such an approach was improper for a number of reasons, that it was... that is, it was incapable of giving consideration to the relative importance of issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.247" offset="12380049">It doesn't address the interrelation of issues, the difficulty of identifying issues, nor the extent of prevailing on various issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.838" offset="12414426">Instead, the court looked to the Johnson factors to analyze the case and specifically the results obtained factor of Johnson to analyze the ultimate accomplishments of the case as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.880" offset="12462596">The district court realized that in the seamless fabric of those accomplishments, that is, vindication of plaintiff's constitutional rights, and substantial changes in the treatment environment, no time was spent on clearly meritless or unrelated claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.733" offset="12521946">By looking at the case as a whole and evaluating the claims within the context of the ultimate results achieved, the district court exercised discretion in the manner intended by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.387" offset="12564578">With that as a background, let's examine what the results were of this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.304" offset="12584326">First of all, plaintiffs had to establish that there was a constitutional right to treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.693" offset="12605851">Defendants had vigorously fought against it, arguing that, one, there was no such a right, and two, to the extent that such a right existed, it would be inapplicable to this class of plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.376" offset="12652558">The court found the existence of such a right, and then proceeded to analyze the six aspects of the treatment environment policies and conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.185" offset="12687771">The court awarded court order relief on five out of six aspects: physical environment; individual treatment plans; least restrictive environment; visitation and telephone; and seclusion and restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.087" offset="12751406">In view of the substantial relief that plaintiffs really did accomplish in this lawsuit, it is easy to understand why the district court as a... found that,</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.831" offset="12802397">"The significance of this case cannot be measured in dollars and cents. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.530" offset="12821205">"It involves constitutional and civil rights of the plaintiff class, and resulted in a number of changes regarding their conditions and treatment at the state hospitals. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.294" offset="12860284">"Not only should plaintiffs be considered prevailing parties within the meaning of the statute, they are parties who have obtained relief of significant import. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.947" offset="12894870">"Plaintiff's relief affects not only them, but numerous other institutionalized patients similarly situated. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.600" offset="12921515">It is also important to point out that not only is the proportionality formula unsupported by the applicable law, but it discourages precisely the zealous representation which the Fees Act seeks and the Code of Professional Responsibility requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.996" offset="13007092">As pointed out and argued in some detail in the amicus brief filed by the American Bar Association, under the Code of Professional Responsibility, attorneys are required to represent clients zealously within the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.629" offset="13061531">If the case is novel or complex, it is difficult to predict which of several good faith arguments plaintiffs would ultimately prevail upon, and therefore to represent a client zealously and ethically, counsel must explore various aspects of the case, develop all the evidence, and present supportable issues to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.900" offset="13158707">To reward only those successful claims undercompensates the necessary early explanatory stages of the lawsuit, invites overly conservative tactics, and would prohibit high risk but deserving actions entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.299" offset="13220251">Petitioner's narrow construction penalizes counsel for acting in conformity with the canons and zealously pursuing the client's interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.640" offset="13261629">Not only has the state argued for an unsupportable standard, they have also, we believe, mischaracterized some of the facts in this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.866" offset="13326517">Over and over again, they have made statements that plaintiffs prevailed... lost on more things than they won.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.850" offset="13354416">Without reciting the long list of the accomplishments, I would simply refer the court to the chart which begins on Page 25 of our brief, which analyzes in some detail the claims of constitutional violations that were in the complaint, and then compares those claims with the relief actually ordered by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.045" offset="13435291">Coming back to the ethical issue involved, as some courts have noted, it hardly furthers the mandate to use the broadest and most flexible remedies available to us to enforce the civil rights law if we so directly discourage innovative and vigorous delving in a changing area of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.940" offset="13526824">That mandate is best served by encouraging attorneys to take the most advantageous position they can that is possible in good faith with respect to their clients.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.018" offset="13563187">Defendants have urged adoption of what they call a standard principle to guide the lower courts in fashioning fees under Section 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.826" offset="13598400">The appropriate standard and method for applying the Fees Act has already been articulated and delineated by Congress in the Act and its legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.663" offset="13641763">In making the fee award in this case, the district court acted in consonance with the standard and method of analysis intended by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.161" offset="13675722">Unless there are any further questions, that is the presentation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3420.879" offset="13830576">I want to briefly discuss the matter of legislative history which has been discussed by my opponent this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.174" offset="13859729">Congress established or set forth, said it was passing Section 1988 for two purposes, to attract competent counsel to civil rights litigation and to avoid windfalls to attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.273" offset="13928170">Now, competent counsel hopefully will competently plead and competently narrow the scope of their litigation before it gets into the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.659" offset="13985744">The Act has secured that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.580" offset="13997342">Counsel are being attracted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.424" offset="14004761">Before 1976, there was no provision for shifting of fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.421" offset="14020748">More importantly is the matter of windfalls to attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.235" offset="14036003">I submit that an attorney who tries to establish a civil rights claim and fails does not succeed, loses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.074" offset="14083337">The result is the court... or the defendant is vindicated with respect to that claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.899" offset="14098697">If he is compensated for his hours spent on that claim, he is receiving a windfall, and Congress said that was one of the purposes of the Act to avoid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.568" offset="14141329">We also discussed the language in the legislative history that says counsel for a prevailing party should be paid is traditional with attorneys compensated by a fee-paying client.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.203" offset="14191902">Now, in the first place, it says for a prevailing party, and my position obviously is that first you have to prevail on the claim to be a prevailing party for attorneys' fees purposes, but the same argument was presented to the District of Columbia Circuit in Copeland versus Marshall, and their response was, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.384" offset="14260552">"It does not follow that the amount of time actually expended is the amount of time reasonably expended. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.488" offset="14288973">"In the private sector billing judgment is an important component in fee setting. "</text>
