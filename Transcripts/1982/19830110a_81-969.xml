            <label>Mr. Kenneth O. Eikenberry</label>
            <text syncTime="10.809" offset="183056">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.058" offset="196118">This case involves the effort of the United States, successful so far, to prevent the State of Washington from deriving any sales tax or use tax from the significant federal construction that's going on in our state.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.098" offset="252229">I'd like first to explain what the controversy is about as a practical matter and then proceed on to the decisions of this Court and how we believe they do allow the application of this sales and use tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.593" offset="306250">Washington imposes a general retail sales tax on the sales of tangible personal property and other services in the State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.527" offset="349926">We do have the usual complementary use tax on the other side of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.275" offset="368944">There is a single rate of 5.4 percent embodied in a single statute applicable to all of these sales occurring in the State, and this by far is our single largest source of general revenue in the State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.955" offset="427667">We do not have, as is common, an income tax, because that is prohibited by our Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.093" offset="464238">Under our system federal contractors are treated the same way as most other buyers of tangible personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.185" offset="492555">When they buy bricks or nails or cement for incorporation into a construction project, they're treated the same way that you or I would be treated if we were buying the same things to improve our homes.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.225" offset="544800">5.4 percent would be added on to the cost of those materials and we would pay it to the seller.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.847" offset="571236">The same is true if we bought an automobile or food or cigarettes or whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.923" offset="595582">The legal problem arises because we treat federal contractors differently from nonfederal contractors in the construction projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.138" offset="632362">Ironically, the Federal Government is challenging our system, which gets more revenue out of nonfederal construction than it does for federal construction, and this is true because for nonfederal construction projects the 5.4 percent tax is added to the entire price of a nonfederal job.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.222" offset="720761">That is, not just for materials but also for labor and profit and overhead.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.626" offset="742390">All of these go into the tax base.</text>

            <text syncTime="394.996" offset="1719788">We believe the principles of federalism and the purpose of the supremacy clause does not require this kind of rigidity or inflexibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.212" offset="1756673">Further, we believe the objections of the United States disregard the common sense that this Court has embodied in prior decisions beginning with the case of James against Dravo Contracting Company in 1937, proceeding on up through the U.S. against Fresno County case in 1977 and as recently as last year, the same principles being articulated in U.S. against Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.903" offset="1859491">I'd like to suggest a case that illustrates the hypertechnical approach being relied on by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.806" offset="1895122">As long ago as 1939 in Southern Pacific Railway against Gallagher in the State of California, a taxpayer was arguing that application of the use tax to property that they brought into the state from out of state was unfair and discriminatory as far as the interstate commerce clause was concerned because it did not equate with a state retail sales tax, which of course applied to vendors and vendees in that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.420" offset="2005567">One of the reasons for the complaint was the theory that the retailer might be able to absorb part of that tax, and this Court said no, that that was hypertechnical, the difference in the legal incidence in the way those taxes were applied made no constitutional difference at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.022" offset="2079964">And as the Court said, there is an equal charge against what is used, whatever its source.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.237" offset="2104833">And this is the approach we're urging on the Court to take today with regard to this hypertechnical, what we believe formalistic complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.298" offset="2137015">We're submitting the Court should construe the supremacy clause so as to protect the Federal Government against a state tax which places the Government at a competitive disadvantage in obtaining resources necessary to perform its functions, but at the same time construing the supremacy clause so as to allow the state the greatest flexibility to fashion a tax scheme that will fit our particular circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.069" offset="2240147">We certainly acknowledge, just to lay the groundwork, that the state may not lay the incidence of a tax directly on the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.487" offset="2273793">That is McColluch against Maryland, starting 160 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.985" offset="2287794">And that is why the legal incidence of this tax was not imposed on the Government here in the State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.139" offset="2312454">And of course, just to make the step, this Court held that a state... it diverted from that and said that the state may impose a tax on people dealing with the Federal Government in 1937 in the James against Dravo case, and this Court held that that may occur even though the cost of that tax is passed on to the Federal Government, even though that becomes an expense of doing that business.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.363" offset="2417257">So that brings us, I believe, to the test, the question here before the Court today: What is the test that should be applied to determine whether a tax with those dealing with the Federal Government is discriminatory under the supremacy clause?</text>
            <text syncTime="584.747" offset="2478802">Now, the Court, as I say, indicated it was all right for a state to tax contractors dealing with the Federal Government if the same tax is imposed on all other contractors, and in so doing the Court implicitly accepted the principle that economic forces will work the same in both the federal and the nonfederal sectors.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.833" offset="2559154">And we suggest that we can go from that case to say that they become economic burden partners in both the federal and the nonfederal sectors.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.890" offset="2607429">By economic burden partners, we'd suggest that we have a case where parties to a transaction which is subject to a tax, where the legal incidence of the tax falls on one party or the other and the economic burden of the tax will be determined as part of the negotiations in response to market forces which would apply to those kinds of transactions at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.458" offset="2709724">So of course the question is, does this economic burden partner principle carry over to the case we're presenting to the Court today, and we believe that it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.158" offset="2748490">The question is, does this principle apply when the legal incidence of a tax is on a different partner in the federal transaction than it does on the partner in the nonfederal transaction.</text>

            <text syncTime="866.992" offset="3607814">The Court did not use that expression, but it was obvious that it was viewed as the burden of the tax passing from the private landlord to his tenant and the possessory interest tax passing from the Federal Government's tenant to the Federal Government, and there was an equalization of the tax that fell on the use of property in that state, and therefore it was not regarded as being discriminatory.</text>

            <text syncTime="931.560" offset="3866113">And there is at least three different aspects that need to be touched on in responding to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.323" offset="3893175">First of all, the economic forces of the marketplace are going to see to it that the parties in negotiating the terms of their contract will balance out, we believe, as between federal and nonfederal.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.177" offset="3948555">In other words, in the federal sector there are such things as advance funding accounts that can be used and have been used, that may completely eliminate that problem for the private contractor, and over on the nonfederal side there are comparable arrangements that can be worked out.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.968" offset="4007696">In any event, it's significant, I think, to point out that the Federal Government has not complained of that as being a problem, nor is there evidence before the Court or in the record on that matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.399" offset="4073420">If we can go ahead and, discussing this same issue that's been raised here by the Court, compare what occurred in the case of United States versus County of Fresno, where we again had the legal incidence falling on one partner in the federal transaction and a different partner in the nonfederal transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.404" offset="4169446">There, of course, under authority of state law a possessory... a leasehold possessory interest tax was imposed against tenants of the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.885" offset="4211347">A comparable tax, a property tax, was imposed by the state on landlords in the private sector.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.804" offset="4239037">And the Court in writing that opinion presumed that the economic burden of that real property tax on the landlord would be passed to the tenant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.970" offset="4291700">Now, of course the presumption then has to be compared with the federal situation, and the Court said nevertheless that the tax was reasonable, that it was fair, that the same market forces applied to both parties as they arrived at their pricing level, and that the placement of the legal incidence in that case was irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.739" offset="4422834">Now, of course there is another matter that comes out of that case that needs to be addressed, and that was the matter, the reasons indicated by Justice Stevens in his dissent that the tax did appear on its face to be discriminatory because of the fact that the Government initially, at least, in its pricing scheme was collecting both the cost... because they were basing their prices on comparable market value or prices for rental units, was including both the possessory interest tax and the... or rather, including the value of property tax and then the tenant was having to pay the possessory interest tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="1540.939" offset="6303651">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.030" offset="6319951">As the Court is well aware, there is a fundamental tenet in our Constitution providing for the immunity of the Federal Government absolutely from state taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.182" offset="6364568">McCulloch established that federal tax immunity, as Chief Justice Marshall said, is the unavoidable consequence of that supremacy which the Constitution has declared.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.646" offset="6418485">Now, we all agree that McCulloch established that the states cannot lay a direct tax upon the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.720" offset="6446697">But there is an important corollary to that doctrine which is equally unquestioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.640" offset="6470416">It is, as the Court has said on numerous occasions, that a tax may be invalid, even though it does not fall directly upon the United States, if it operates so as to discriminate against the Government or those with whom it deals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.837" offset="6539171">The Court said that in the United States versus City of Detroit and has reaffirmed that in Phillips Chemical Company, Moses Lake Homes, and a whole host of precedents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.739" offset="6582847">This corollary is essential to the integrity of the federal tax immunity principle, because otherwise the very functioning of the Federal Government would be impaired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.515" offset="6629868">For example, if a state attempted to tax the income solely of federal employees, that tax would be indisputably invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.572" offset="6674171">But an income tax laid upon all residents of the state, which includes federal employees, would be constitutional, as indeed this Court held in Graves ex rel. versus O'Keefe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.506" offset="6721923">So the rule that has emerged in more recent terms from the decisions of this Court is that the economic burden on a federal function of a state tax imposed upon those who deal with the Federal Government renders the tax invalid if it is not imposed equally on the other similarly situated constituents of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.386" offset="6817427">In our view, the Court of Appeals correctly identified the Washington sales tax at issue here as a classic example of discriminatory taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.428" offset="6861522">All will agree, and the State indeed properly concedes, that the Washington legislature engaged in a purposeful attempt to circumvent the immunity of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="1780.826" offset="7263180">In other words, so that the Federal Government's immunity would prevent the state from imposing a tax on the... you know, on the contractor's profit, you know, which would be the cost borne by the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.320" offset="7309156">But the statutory history reveals that that really, and the statute indicates, that that really isn't what happened here, because in 1935 when this tax was enacted the tax was on, the Washington sales tax, was on sales to building contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.440" offset="7373626">That is, to use the Attorney General's example, if a contractor purchased a nail or some other component that went into a house from a hardware company, that contractor would have to pay the sales tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.182" offset="7448545">All contractors would pay that sales tax, whether... no matter whom they dealt with, the Federal Government, the state government, or a private party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.475" offset="7477802">The tax was imposed on contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.521" offset="7489923">In 1941 the State wanted to... the State changed the tax, and what it did was it changed the tax to sales by contractors, so that the tax began to be paid by consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.656" offset="7554498">Now, the State did this legitimately in order to increase its tax base, in order to include the contractor's profit in the tax base.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.792" offset="7599011">But because it did this and imposed the tax at the customer level, of course, the Federal Government was a customer; all those transactions became immune under the absolute immunity of the Federal Government that this Court has never questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.269" offset="7656898">So now, for more than 30 years the State was apparently content with this choice, that is, an enhanced tax base in the private and state sphere, gaining enhanced revenues from these sources at the price of sacrificing... and indeed, at the constitutional price of sacrificing revenue from Federal Government contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.309" offset="7741117">And in 1975 it saw that, when federal construction activity in the State of Washington became greater and more intense, the State sought to include somehow the Federal Government's contracting activity in its tax base, while retaining the enhanced tax base on private construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.345" offset="7837247">The State did not want to give up that aspect of its tax law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.375" offset="7853339">So in 1975 the State amended its sales tax to impose, as we have it now, a tax upon contractors for the United States, but not upon other contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.214" offset="7900673">Now, there's no doubt, indeed, that this... these amendments intended to circumvent the federal tax immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.743" offset="7926795">The legislative history indicates that, the staff reports indicate it, that there some question as to whether this was discriminatory under the decisions of this Court, and indeed the State so acknowledges that intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.817" offset="7979144">Now, in our view these 1975 amendments effectively single out the Federal Government's contractors for state taxation, and therefore runs afoul of the discrimination corollary under the immunity--</text>

            <text syncTime="2318.514" offset="9413894">Here we have a situation where the State is attempting to save its tax by pointing to the customers, the private customers, and saying, we don't have to worry about the fact that we're not taxing the private contractors because we're taxing the private customers.</text>

            <text syncTime="2371.429" offset="9625590">And in this particular instance we have a situation where the contractor who deals with the Federal Government is subject to tax and the contractor who deals with a private party and the State is not subject to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.518" offset="9677940">In fact, the State responds by saying, as you've suggested, that the discriminatory treatment could be cured simply if the United States would reimburse its contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.967" offset="9719735">But really, that turns the immunity principle on its head.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.278" offset="9736976">It identifies the federal tax immunity, the absolute immunity that this Court has repeatedly indicated it has never questioned, as the cause of the discriminatory treatment here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2684.225" offset="10876751">Because I don't... I think it would be... I would counsel against the Court engaging in a kind of quantification of how much is enough.</text>

            <text syncTime="2711.121" offset="10984375">I think from a constitutional point of view the Federal Government has to be protected by including all similarly situated people within the tax, and that in our view here means the contractors, and that, the absence of the contractors here which deal with the State and with private parties, is glaringly absent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.409" offset="11073505">If the State wants to return to 1935, we don't have any quarrel with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.719" offset="11094717">If it wants to impose a tax based on the gross receipts of all contractors, James versus Dravo Contracting Company establishes the validity of that kind of tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.355" offset="11145290">But here we have a situation where the State really wants to have it both ways.</text>

            <text syncTime="2764.489" offset="11197848">And in our view it can't do that in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.332" offset="11213208">And in that respect, I simply want to identify, we talked at the beginning about purposeful circumvention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.251" offset="11240898">There are... there are precedents of this Court that indicate that the identification by a state of federal activity or tax-immune income for taxation by circumvention is improper and imperils the supremacy clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.805" offset="11323027">And I would refer the Court to an old, but in our view perfectly appropriate, decision, Miller versus Milwaukee, which dealt with that sort of thing; and Moses Lake Homes, which in fact... Moses Lake Homes--</text>

            <text syncTime="2824.746" offset="11438802">And in fact, Moses Lake Homes, it seems to us, answers the very attempt of the state here to recast the absolute immunity that the Court has never questioned in terms of a no competitive disadvantage principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.662" offset="11506511">If the Court will recall in Moses Lake Homes, a case which also came from the State of Washington, the State of Washington imposed a higher tax on federal lessees than state... than private lessees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.514" offset="11561891">And the Court... the Ninth Circuit struck that tax down and remanded it to the district court for recomputation to impose an equivalent tax on the federal lessees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.228" offset="11624793">And when the case came to this Court, this Court had no trouble saying that a discriminatory tax like that was invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.505" offset="11657917">Without further discussion, the whole tax was invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.019" offset="11675889">So we're not really... it seems to us it would be wrong to demean the absolute immunity of the United States from federal taxation and the anti-discrimination principle which is part and parcel of that by saying that somehow, as long as the Federal Government or federal construction contracts bear the same cost in the marketplace, that that's sufficient, the Federal Government simply is protected against paying any more.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.742" offset="11794798">In our view, the decisions of this Court convincingly refute that kind of relegation of the immunity principle to what I might call a most favored nation clause in a tariff treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.002" offset="11851850">This is an essential part of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.501" offset="11865851">It protects the Federal Government from impairment of its functions by insisting that those who deal with the Federal Government are not singled out for discriminatory tax treatment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2993.241" offset="12112865">In fact, the Federal Government even has a cushion, if you will, because the tax in the federal situation, the tax base is lower.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.738" offset="12150795">This test provides the United States not being placed at a competitive disadvantage in carrying out its functions, and it provides that those who are similarly situated in other transactions will be treated alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.685" offset="12218609">It ensures, we believe also, that there will be a political check, because this broad class has been created and the taxes will therefore not be raised abusively.</text>
