            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="92436">The last case I have to announce is Pacific Gas &amp; Electric against the State Energy Commission of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.932" offset="128067">Under -- under the California law, the Commission before it issues a license for a nuclear energy plant must determine that that plant will have adequate storage capacity for the interim storage of spent fuel.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.536" offset="202568">The statute also imposes a moratorium on any nuclear plant licensing until and unless the Federal Government approves a technology for the permanent storage of high level of nuclear waste.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.507" offset="278428">The utilities who are the petitioners in this case filed a suit claiming that these provisions were invalid under the Supremacy Clause because they were in conflict with the federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.069" offset="348645">The District Court agreed but the Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.479" offset="382291">The Court of Appeals said that the issue about relating to interim storage was not right for resolution, but it went to hold that the moratorium was valid because it was not in conflict with a federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.308" offset="461598">We granted certiorari and we affirm in all aspects with the reasons we have stated in an opinion filed with the -- with the clerk.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.674" offset="499110">We agree with the Court of Appeals that the interim storage provision was not ripe for resolution and that the moratorium is it either conflicts with federal law and it doesn't frustrate any objective of the -- of the federal law, so we affirm the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.909" offset="579985">Justice Blackmun joined by Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</text>
