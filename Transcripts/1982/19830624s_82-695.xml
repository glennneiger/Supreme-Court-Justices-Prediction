            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="92312">I have for announcement the decision on 82-695, Franchise Tax Board versus the Construction Laborers Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.930" offset="135989">The principal question in dispute between the parties to that appeal, which is here from the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, is whether the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), previously mentioned by my Brother Blackmun, permits state tax authorities to collect unpaid state income taxes by levying on funds held in trust for the taxpayers under an ERISA-covered vacation benefit plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.295" offset="257406">We don't, however, decide the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.884" offset="267750">That's because we hold that the lower federal courts had no jurisdiction to address or decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.484" offset="294186">We therefore vacate the judgment and remand the case to the state court from which it was removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.347" offset="321667">Our reasons are set forth at length.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.394" offset="329817">In an opinion filed to the clerk, that decision was unanimous.</text>
