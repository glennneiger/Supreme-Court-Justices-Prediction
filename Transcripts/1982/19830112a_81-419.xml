            <label>Mr. C. Chris Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="17.962" offset="228956">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="22.496" offset="247138">This case is before the Court on a writ of certiorari directed to the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.233" offset="270021">In 1979 respondent Clifford James Brown was charged with a second degree felony offense under state law of possession of a controlled substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.273" offset="310250">This charge stemmed from an incident in which respondent was found in possession of a tied-off balloon containing heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.029" offset="337208">Respondent moved to suppress the heroin on the grounds that it was the product of an illegal warrantless seizure, and after an evidentiary hearing in the trial court, the motion to suppress was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.551" offset="379317">Respondent then entered a plea of nolo contendre to the charge, reserving under state procedures his right to appeal the seizure question; and he was sentenced to four years' imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.858" offset="424561">On appeal a three-judge panel of the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas reversed the conviction, holding that this warrantless seizure of the knotted balloon violated the plain view doctrine as announced in Coolidge v. New Hampshire.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.135" offset="481613">The theory below was that for the contraband nature of that balloon to have been "immediately apparent" to the officer as required by Coolidge, the officer had to know what was inside the balloon.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.628" offset="539605">And in the opinion of the Court of Criminal Appeals, because this balloon was opaque, the officer obviously could not see inside the balloon and could not have known what was inside.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.667" offset="579833">Therefore, they found the seizure to be improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.452" offset="590909">The State of Texas filed a motion for rehearing or a request for rehearing, but that motion for leave to file was denied by the en banc court, three of those nine judges filing a written dissent to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.362" offset="650573">It was the belief of these dissenters that probable cause, not knowledge, was the standard to which the seizing officer was held, and that when proper regard was given to the inferences that this experienced officer was able to draw when he saw the balloon, probable cause was evident, and the seizure was proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.407" offset="722775">To amplify on the facts of the seizure, on June 18th, 1979, Fort Worth police officer Tom Maples and other members of the Patrol Division had set up a roadblock-type of driver's license check.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.035" offset="785260">They were checking, stopping each vehicle that came through this roadblock, checking the drivers for driver's licenses and checking the vehicles for expired inspection stickers or registration and license plate violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.962" offset="844924">They were not checking the drivers for outstanding warrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.164" offset="857776">They were not looking for any particular individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.866" offset="868539">They did not have any members of the narcotics detail with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.234" offset="882018">It happened to be Officer Maples who stopped respondent's vehicle when he came through this checkpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.637" offset="907618">When Officer Maples asked the respondent to exhibit a driver's license, the respondent reached in his right front pants pocket, fumbled around in that pocket long enough to alarm the officer, and caused him to shine his flashlight into the car, this incident having occurred around 11:00 to 11:15 at night, and when the respondent withdrew his hand from that pants pocket, the officer could see him holding two items.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.289" offset="1014302">Between his thumb and index finger he was holding a folded dollar bill, but between his two middle fingers where I've placed this box, he was holding a small, green, knotted, opaque, tied-off balloon.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.314" offset="1074383">The officer described it as being tied about a half inch from the end, and when mashed down it was approximately one-eight of an inch thick.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.320" offset="1106357">The officer then saw the respondent drop this balloon alongside his leg onto the car seat.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.908" offset="1132793">The respondent reached over and opened the glove box of the vehicle, presumably still trying to find the driver's license.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.712" offset="1159961">The light in that box came on, and inside there the officer could see several items.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.116" offset="1181590">He saw what he described as a lot of loose white powder, a bag of balloons apparently just as they had come from the store, several small, empty plastic vials.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.189" offset="1229864">The officer, having been experienced in this sort of thing, formed the conclusion that there was some sort of narcotic substance in that green balloon he had first seen, so he asked the respondent to step from the car and move to the rear of the vehicle, which respondent did closing the door behind him.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.615" offset="1295588">The officer could then see inside the vehicle still, saw the green balloon on the car seat where the respondent dropped it, and he reached in and picked up the balloon, noticing at that time that it contained some sort of powdery substance inside.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.542" offset="1351281">The record also shows that this officer was a five-year veteran of the police department.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.696" offset="1371866">He had taken part in several arrests where such balloons had been seized and found to contain narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.766" offset="1396212">He had made one such arrest himself in the previous year in which eight or nine such balloons had been recovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.420" offset="1418782">He had talked with his fellow officers about the fact that narcotics were often packaged this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.722" offset="1439993">He had talked with drug users about the use of milk sugar, which is apparently what this loose powder was.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.561" offset="1467370">He knew from his experience what those empty plastic vials could have been put to.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.263" offset="1486178">And it was based on this, the circumstances of seeing this balloon and his experience with the narcotics trade, that caused him to believe the balloon contained narcotics, caused him to seize it, and caused him then to place respondent under arrest for possession of a controlled substance.</text>

I'm not sure if that's pill bottles or test tube type of vials... a bag of balloons, apparently a bag just as they had come from the store... these balloons were empty... and he also saw the balloons, empty plastic vials and loose white powder.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.309" offset="1658377">Now, at that time in the record the officer didn't further describe this powder, but after the arrest he conducted an inventory of the vehicle, found a bottle of milk sugar in the back seat, and given the record, it appears that milk sugar was also what this loose white powder was.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.336" offset="1730475">There's no evidence in the record that this additional powder was itself a controlled substance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1766.647" offset="7223712">There are two aspects to the respondent's position that we'd like to review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.015" offset="7241162">The first is the one that Mr. Marshall just left off on, and that is it is respectfully suggested that this case is not ripe and should be sent back to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals for clarification as to exactly what was the basis of their decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.441" offset="7298841">Was it in fact Article I, Section 9 of the Texas constitution, or was it in fact the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution?</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.880" offset="7332591">Secondly, the respondent would state that if the Court does reach the search issue, an analysis of the case shows it to be consistent with the federal rules in the cases dealing with the plain view seizures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.340" offset="7398524">Looking at the first issue, that is, the independent state grounds, respondent would say that this is not a Fourth Amendment case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.663" offset="7435722">It's interesting to note that in the opinion of the court below the only mention of the Fourth Amendment is where the court reprints the respondent's motion to suppress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.487" offset="7479085">The motion to suppress cites as a basis the Fourth Amendment to the United States and Article I, Section 9 of the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.259" offset="7510119">Those two are juxtaposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.676" offset="7515866">They are next to one another in the respondent's motion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1873.749" offset="7652121">The defendant in that cause filed a motion to suppress and based it on the amendments four, five of the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 9 of the Texas constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.140" offset="7705724">The analysis of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals was that under this Court's ruling, the Fifth Amendment privilege did not extend to the blood test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.250" offset="7758073">Further, under Schmurber v. California, the defendant, given those circumstances, there was no Fourth Amendment requirement that a search warrant be obtained prior to getting the blood test.</text>

            <text syncTime="3470.930" offset="14040836">There is a red balloon case, DeLoa v. the State, a 1977 one, where again the officer making an arrest found a red balloon on the window sill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.738" offset="14084094">He seized it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.688" offset="14091827">It was in fact heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.773" offset="14096215">That was ruled inadmissible, again because the officer failed to articulate a rational basis for his arriving at the conclusion that he had evidence of a crime before him.</text>

            <label>Mr. C. Chris Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="3579.082" offset="14473423">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, if I have time to make just a couple of points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.634" offset="14487634">First, I think respondent is attributing to the state court a finding it didn't make; that is, something about articulating the basis for probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.771" offset="14520235">My recollection is that Simpson v. State, which is cited in Judge McCormick's dissent below, will make clear that Texas has always looked to the objective facts, not to the officer's subjective state of mind to look to probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.614" offset="14579585">I'd also say that I believe it's true, as Justice White says, that this case could be decided in the State's favor without mentioning the plain view doctrine, because cases such as Chadwick, Sanders, and G.M. Leasing seem to indicate that the mere seizure of an item can be based on probable cause as opposed to what might need to be shown for the search of it.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="3628.396" offset="14670700">Well, you can arrest a person on probable cause.</text>

            <label>Mr. C. Chris Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="3629.515" offset="14675193">Certainly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.031" offset="14677283">Under U.S. v. Watson, you can arrest on probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.550" offset="14687314">However, this could be seen as a plain view case in the sense that the officer did view these items in the car without having to make any search, any rummaging of the car; and to that extent it can be seen as a plain view case, though again as Justice Stevens suggests, that could be said of most... said to be true of most any plain view case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3652.679" offset="14767876">The point we want to make is that we don't believe the plain view doctrine, which is what the Texas court relied on, should be a restriction on the state's activities, on the police officer's authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.652" offset="14811761">We believe that probable cause is a standard, and that's what should have been applied here.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3668.990" offset="14833077">Mr. Marshall, as a general proposition do you take the view that the Texas Article I, Section 9 protection is co-extensive with the Fourth Amendment?</text>
            <text syncTime="3677.746" offset="14868081">He cited just one case, I think, the Schmurber problem, where it seemed to be different.</text>

            <label>Mr. C. Chris Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="3682.298" offset="14886263">I was going to say something about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.316" offset="14894413">I believe, although I don't have the case with me because it hadn't been cited before, that shephardizing Escamillia would show that it has now been overruled because of a recent amendment to the Texas search warrant statute in Chapter 18 of our Code of Criminal Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3698.493" offset="14951046">And I think that decision there was based not on state constitutional law, but on the specific search warrant statute we had.</text>
            <text syncTime="3706.015" offset="14981139">And I think in general our Article I, Section 9 is co-extensive with the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3712.252" offset="15006112">I know Article I, Section 10 has recently, a month ago, been held to be co-extensive with the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.089" offset="15033489">That was in a case called Ex parte Shorthaus just published at 640 Southwest Second 924.</text>
            <text syncTime="3727.679" offset="15067866">And I am not aware of any case where under state constitutional law we have found any special state law plain view doctrine or any state law unusual or peculiar notion of probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3742.021" offset="15125231">And again on this state law ground question, I think it is very clear that every state case the Court of Criminal Appeals cited here... Nicholas, Duncan, DeLoa... each one of those the Court will find expressly relies on Coolidge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3756.781" offset="15184268">In fact, in Howard v. State the panel opinion in that case says, "Following the teachings" of Coolidge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3764.518" offset="15215196">We'd ask this Court to reverse the judgment and render judgment in favor of the State of Texas.</text>
