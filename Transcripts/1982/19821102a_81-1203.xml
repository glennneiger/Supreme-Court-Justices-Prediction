            <text syncTime="185.971" offset="890858">The federal statute involved is the Federal Arbitration Act which the North Carolina Supreme Court has held is a part of the law of North Carolina under the supremacy clause and must be enforced as any other part of the law of North Carolina would be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.979" offset="962851">So the dichotomy between federal and state law is confusing in the circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="239.165" offset="1103599">The next question involved, and just as important as that one, in my view, is how and when the federal appeals courts may review the exercise of the district judge's discretion.</text>

            <text syncTime="274.650" offset="1245496">So analytically I think that is the first question that we should discuss.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.305" offset="1268171">The facts giving rise to these questions are that on October 8th, 1980, the hospital filed suit in the North Carolina Superior Court of Guilford County in Greensboro against two defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.972" offset="1342881">First was Mercury Construction Corporation, an Alabama corporation; and second was J.N. Pease &amp; Associates, a North Carolina corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.152" offset="1383527">The complaint filed in the Superior Court in North Carolina alleged that some months earlier, Mercury had delivered to Pease, the architect, a document entitled Claim for Equitable Adjustment of Contract Price; that this asserted a claim for some $2 million against the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.546" offset="1505153">The hospital had spent some months investigating that claim, had concluded it had no validity, had concluded that the basis for the claim was alleged delays which were the fault of the hospital during a period of construction of about five years on a renovation and new construction project at the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.974" offset="1598881">The complaint in the district court alleged that there was no fault in the hospital concerning delays of an ongoing hospital operation, renovation and construction project; that if there were delays beyond that which was contemplated by the parties in the beginning, they were the fault either of Mercury or of the architect.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.587" offset="1697310">And alleged various instances in which the architect was at fault in failing to adjudicate, in failing to pass on decisions of both parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.771" offset="1742032">The complaint prayed that if it was found that the hospital was liable in any respect, that it sought judgment over against the architect.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.687" offset="1785708">Mercury, some three weeks later, filed... or removed the action under the removal statute to the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.793" offset="1830117">And curiously, at the same time filed a Section 4 petition under the Federal Arbitration Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1076.476" offset="4452811">And a party can obtain review of that through the state court appeals process.</text>

            <text syncTime="1094.047" offset="4523132">That just does not comport with common sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.186" offset="4543717">I think once a party has had determined his right... and in this instance, there is no question but what Mercury has a right to have the question of arbitration decided by a court of competent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.462" offset="4612784">Mercury has no right to select its court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.693" offset="4629712">It was the defendant in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.894" offset="4642564">Mercury has filed a duplicative litigation in this case in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.392" offset="4664507">The parties have always been able to go to the court in which this action was instituted and obtain a speedy adjudication of that very right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.106" offset="4711318">The question presented, therefore, is not whether Mercury has been deprived of its right of prompt decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.915" offset="4746636">What Mercury is complaining about is it's been deprived of the right to choose the forum, and that's the only difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.382" offset="4788432">It has no right to choose the forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.114" offset="4799403">Wise administration of justice compels the conclusion that you don't keep racing to judgment whenever you have multiple litigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.860" offset="4838378">So the question is which court should wait on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.748" offset="4853947">In the circumstances here, it makes sense that the federal court should wait on the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.309" offset="4876203">All the traditional considerations are present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.575" offset="4893235">If I may now address the question of appealability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.292" offset="4916118">The central point here is that the stay order is not a final order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.833" offset="4946316">The cases in this Court are so recent that I don't think they require extensive discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.236" offset="4979857">In this case, the judge was free, and I think designedly so... he did not dismiss the case... he was free, if Mercury comes back in and says I can't get a decision... in other words, my prompt hearing is being denied me in the state court... the judge could clearly have lifted his stay order and proceeded to the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.710" offset="5085810">But we didn't have time to determine that the way this case went.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.378" offset="5104409">There's no doubt but that he was free to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.441" offset="5120709">If Mercury was being denied its right to a prompt hearing before a court of competent jurisdiction, he probably would have lifted his stay order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.672" offset="5165640">There can be no doubt, therefore, that this is not a final order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.043" offset="5183090">In the court of appeals, the court applied its practical finality analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.788" offset="5230110">I submit to this honorable Court that the &amp; Lybrand is not materially distinguishable from the practical finality rule applied here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.157" offset="5299596">The point is that Congress did not intend the courts of appeals to fashion on a case-by-case basis their own jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.573" offset="5349228">When Congress enacted Section 1291 that appeal shall lie only from final decisions, that does not include stay orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.240" offset="5395935">The court of appeals should not analyze its jurisdiction on a case-by-case basis; that is a mini-trial all over again, just as the death knell economic inquiry was a mini-trial all over again.</text>

            <text syncTime="2188.161" offset="8899583">The first is that generally, the federal courts are far more familiar with the interpretation and enforcement of the Federal Arbitration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.438" offset="8936677">Second, we have a congressionally granted right to a hearing in the federal courts on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.047" offset="8963113">And as a matter of fact, the form of relief, although I don't make a big point out of this, the form of relief is different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.949" offset="8998744">Under Section 4, which only federal district courts can apply, we are entitled to an order compelling arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.099" offset="9031344">Under the Section 3, which would be the federal remedy in the state court case, the remedy there is to stay that case, pending arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.128" offset="9083485">So we do think there is a difference in the remedies, and that different was recognized in Prima Paint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.047" offset="9107099">For example, the court in Prima Paint specifically referred to Section 4 as applying a federal remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2313.908" offset="9402597">In the record, it is very clear in the affidavits that were filed by our client to the district court, it is clear that the contractor went to the architect during the course of construction and said we will have claims, and the architect said, we understand you will have claims, and we request that you withhold the filing of those claims until after construction is completed.</text>

I think the Fourth Circuit was right that as a practical matter, assuming that the state court is going to move with any kind of dispatch, that what has really happened is that the federal court has denied us the right to have our Section 4 right enforced in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.900" offset="10858557">I can conceive of examples of where that wouldn't happen, but I think as a practical matter, Justice Rehnquist, that belies the reality of the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.988" offset="10906936">And I might point out two other things at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.644" offset="10917490">One is that the stay order did not say I am staying the Section 4 case pending a determination of the question as to arbitrability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.810" offset="10966182">It said I am staying the Section 4 case pending a determination of the entire case pending in a North Carolina court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.496" offset="10996902">The second thing is that at the time the district court made its ruling, it had before it affidavits that had been filed on the issue of arbitration under Section 4, which is the normal way in my experience that that issue is dealt with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.895" offset="11058551">And the issue had been fully briefed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.989" offset="11066910">No such affidavits and no such briefing had taken place in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.454" offset="11084778">So at that particular point in time, more activity had occurred in the district court, the federal district court, than had occurred in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.748" offset="11117901">And, as a matter of fact, as the Fourth Circuit found, the district court had before it all the information that it needed or was necessary to make an order that our client was entitled to arbitration and that the district court should have compelled arbitration.</text>

            <text syncTime="2920.425" offset="11828641">In so holding, the Fourth Circuit, in our view, followed the rule of this Court that has been applied for many years, and that is that finality is to be given a practical rather than a technical construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.997" offset="11898962">The underpinning or the basis for the finality rule, as stated in the decisions of this Court, is that you will not have piecemeal reviews.</text>

            <text syncTime="3125.637" offset="12649513">I might add that North Carolina, after this case was decided by the district court, did enter a case that said the Federal Arbitration Act would be the law of that state, but there are other states at this time that do not do that.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="3345.815" offset="13530153">Well, if it is--</text>

            <text syncTime="3346.642" offset="13533496">--but if it happens to be decided in the state court, the state court is obligated to apply that federal substantive law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.561" offset="13557215">And as Mr. Floyd said, that is what the North Carolina Supreme Court has held subsequent to this case, and what most other courts have held.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.043" offset="13587099">To return for a moment to the question of appealability, this is not a piecemeal appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.928" offset="13638613">This is an appeal of the only issue that exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.067" offset="13651256">And the Gillespie case, we think, has application here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.236" offset="13683857">I understand that in Livesay, this Court said that we want to make sure that the courts understand that Gillespie is limited, a limited decision, but we think that if Gillespie is ever going to have any application, that this is the kind of case to which it ought to apply, and we have cited in our brief a number of cases where the circuit courts have applied Gillespie in a limited way to take appeal of stay orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.911" offset="13822619">In addition, we think the Cohen case is applicable to this situation, the collateral order rule in the Cohen case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.249" offset="13855952">We were denied the right to a hearing, which in our view was finally denied to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.092" offset="13883328">That is an important question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.465" offset="13888762">It is an important federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.686" offset="13893673">It is an important question to people who in our situation are trying to enforce arbitration agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.791" offset="13918123">And finally, that decision was unreviewable on appeal, because once the matter went to the state court and was determined by the state court, there is nothing for an appeal to the circuit court, and as a matter of fact, if the circuit court and if the state court finds the case... decides the case on the arbitration question, then there is no right of appeal within the federal system to us to a circuit court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.404" offset="14028569">Obviously, it is possible for the case to wind its way up through the state court system and then take a discretionary appeal to this Court, but that is a very difficult and very torturous route.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.149" offset="14075589">I would like to turn for one minute, if I could, to the stay question, because I think that what Mr. Floyd and the hospital are suggesting here turns Colorado River upside down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.704" offset="14137761">In Colorado River, this Court held that unless there were unusual circumstances, the federal court could not defer its jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.593" offset="14189274">What the hospital is really arguing, we think, is that the mere fact of the prior filing of the case in the state court system requires that the case be referred back to the state court system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.726" offset="14249878">If you look at the facts in Colorado River, you had the McCarren Act in the Colorado River, which indicated that these water right cases should be decided in the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.970" offset="14298779">As a matter of fact, there was even a question before this Court as to whether or not the federal court still had jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.967" offset="14326783">That was the first issue this Court decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.607" offset="14337336">There is no such thing in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.434" offset="14348726">As a matter of fact, exactly to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.372" offset="14356458">This Section 4 is a right... granted a right to my client to have a hearing in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.479" offset="14380908">The second thing is that in Colorado River you had a res, the water rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.083" offset="14403269">There is no res in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.036" offset="14411106">There is no similar existing body of property to be dealt with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.767" offset="14446006">And in the Colorado River, there was a very... they emphasized there were a thousand defendants in the state court case, and that they were 300 miles apart, all of these factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.887" offset="14502535">That is not true in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.543" offset="14513088">Both cases are in the courts in the county where Greensboro, North Carolina, resides.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.508" offset="14548928">The only factor in this case that is similar to Colorado River or that Colorado River relied on is the matter of priority of filing, and we do not believe that the simple matter of priority of filing should be determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.579" offset="14613294">On the issue of priority of filing, I would like to point out again that we as a party trying to seek to enforce our Section 4 rights do not have the right to go into court and enforce those rights until the other party has declined to arbitrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.196" offset="14691766">The only solution that we had in this situation absent what happened is to ignore the fact that we were in discussions with the hospital about our claims, ignore that, file our arbitration demand, and then see whether or not they would resist it or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.187" offset="14767730">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
