            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="70.363" offset="426665">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="91.698" offset="512033">This case which is here on the government's petition to the Seventh Circuit presents a question concerning court authorized and court supervised disclosure of grand jury materials to the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to Rule 6(e) of the Rules of Criminal Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.312" offset="626450">Several issues were litigated below, but we confined our petition for certiorari to a single issue, not because we agree with the Court of Appeals' decision regarding all of the other issues, but because we wanted to present the Court with the issue of greatest importance administratively and the issue that reflects a long-standing practice of many years in the issuance of Rule 6(e) orders by district courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.717" offset="780050">The case arises out of a special grand jury investigation of commodity futures trading transactions before the Chicago Board of Trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.603" offset="835638">The grand jury was investigating related criminal violations of the Commodities Exchange Act and of the Internal Revenue Code and was assisted by Internal Revenue Service agents as well as other personnel to help in the analysis of the information that was being secured.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.857" offset="948696">The grand jury proceedings itself with respect to Mr. Baggot culminated in a guilty plea, which was accepted... a plea of guilt to misdemeanors for violations of the Commodities Exchange Act, violations that involved participation in rigged commodity trades that produced substantial paper losses, which he deducted in preparing his tax return, and yet he recovered most of those losses in the form of cash kickbacks from his trading partners.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.526" offset="1127374">So, the guilty plea was based on a theory of violations that have implications for tax purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.881" offset="1164781">After some preliminary proceedings which are not important for purposes of what is before this Court, the United States Attorney sought disclosure at the request of the chief of the Examination Division of the Internal Revenue Service of the grand jury materials for their use by the Service in determining whether there was a deficiency in Mr. Baggot's tax return.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.961" offset="1309081">And, the question we have presented is a question that arises under Rule 6(e)(3)(C)(i) whether the disclosure that was requested here that would be permitted in the absence of authorization by the Court is disclosure that would be directed by a court preliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.024" offset="1445336">The answer is to be secured principally from analysis of the language in legislative history of this provision as it was reenacted with a textural rearrangement in 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.128" offset="1517747">Before proceeding to that, I wish to make a few observations to put the question in some perspective in assessing the language in legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.558" offset="1579501">The first is, perhaps the too obvious point, that we are not dealing here with a situation that involves any taint or impropriety on the part of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.363" offset="1646688">The investigation of the grand jury was conducted as it was authorized to be conducted, and the participation of the Internal Revenue Service agents was in no way improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.076" offset="1709486">It is specifically provided for in Rule 6(e), and, as a matter of fact, because this grand jury investigation commenced before the recent amendment of Rule 6(e)... the 1977 amendment, there was an order by the court authorizing the Internal Revenue Service agents to participate, to assist the grand jury and the United States Attorney in analyzing the evidence that was being secured.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.859" offset="1848667">And, no use for any other purpose was attempted to be made of this information except upon application to the court to secure the proper court order under Rule 6(e).</text>
            <text syncTime="442.212" offset="1914077">So, we are not dealing with any sort of taint or improper conduct from that standpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.975" offset="1949081">Nor, is there a basis in this case for what has been referred to as abuse of the grand jury, whether or not it is a term of art.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.719" offset="2008118">The fact that there had been a guilty plea accepted in the case certainly indicates that the grand jury was not being used as a subterfuge for a non-criminal purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.194" offset="2085963">Nor, on the face of it is there any injustice in the idea that when evidentiary materials have come forth which indicate not only a violation of criminal law but also a deficiency in the payment of taxes that are owing.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.420" offset="2174884">Nor, there is certainly no injustice in taking steps to see to it that those taxes are paid by Mr. Baggot as they would be by any other taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.069" offset="2237473">From the standpoint of what seemed to be the concern of Congress in 1977 when it recodified this Rule, a concern that a safeguard be included against a cat's paw type of use of the grand jury to obtain evidence for civil purposes and only for civil purposes in ways that were not authorized to the agencies to obtain their evidence--</text>

            <text syncTime="559.164" offset="2381878">Mr. Wallace, I notice the way you put that.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.897" offset="2392850">I would suppose you would think you could use the grand jury for dual purposes as long as you had a bona fide criminal investigation going on that you could conduct a parallel civil investigation using grand jury material?</text>

            <text syncTime="580.124" offset="2465679">It is also my understanding of what this Court said in Proctor &amp; Gamble.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.326" offset="2486577">It said much the same thing in a case called United States against Kordel, 397 U.S. 1, where the complaint was made the other way around that the civil investigation was being used to secure information that would be used in the prosecution--</text>

            <text syncTime="607.207" offset="2574035">Has it not some times happened that information from one of the civil... one of the non-criminal divisions not secured by discovery but just their own investigation, then might be referred to the Criminal Division for prosecution when some lawyers in the Division make a judgment that there is criminal conduct involved?</text>

            <text syncTime="639.835" offset="2704543">Is it not a fact that they might be violating some federal statute if they didn't, is that not so?</text>

          <turn speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="644.911" stopTime="1000.658">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="644.911" offset="2724918">--I would not want to go that far, but an argument could be made to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.440" offset="2746965">But, it certainly is a common practice not only for attorneys within the Department of Justice but in the agencies and departments to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.922" offset="2780925">And, this Court has many times referred to the fact that the Internal Revenue Service refers matters to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.761" offset="2820317">It has been a criterion used in cases dealing with the enforcement of Internal Revenue summonses which are to be used prior to these referrals and not subsequently.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.960" offset="2861068">But, the discussion always assumed that it was a proper function to make the referrals to criminal prosecution when evidence of wrong-doing was found.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.284" offset="2902342">The fact is many statutes impose law enforcement duties, both criminal and civil, on attorneys and others for the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.701" offset="2956050">And, while I do not wish to denigrate the concern that Congress had in the safeguard that it wanted to provide that the grand jury not be subverted to uses wholly for a civil purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.458" offset="3031073">I think the danger of that can easily be exaggerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.550" offset="3051449">From where I stand within the government, the complaint that we hear most of the time from the departments and agencies is that they cannot get the U. S. Attorneys to use the grand jury as often as they would like to pursue the criminal violations that the departments and agencies think they have uncovered because grand juries are time consuming and resources are limited and the use of the grand jury has to be rationed.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.459" offset="3179031">While we do not in any way advocate not observing the safeguard that Congress intended in this Rule, we do not think there is a great danger that the United States Attorneys are subject to manipulation for use of the grand jury for civil purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.902" offset="3280804">In most instances, they have all they can do to use it for all of the criminal cases that might warrant its use.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.882" offset="3316748">That is the experience we are having these days, at least.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.239" offset="3342139">The other... before we proceed to the language and legislative history at issue here... the other perspective that I think is useful to keep in mind is whether the application that was made by the Internal Revenue Service here poses any of the dangers to the integrity and efficacy of the grand jury process itself that this Court has observed from time to time.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.055" offset="3469408">We set forth on pages 31 and 32 of our brief, the five standards of the Rose case that this Court twice approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.878" offset="3508696">Because the grand jury proceeding had been completed here and particularly because it had been concluded with a guilty plea, it is only the fourth of these standards that could possibly have any relevance here, the encouragement of free and untrammeled disclosure by witnesses, by persons who have information with respect to the commission of crimes, or as the Court said in Proctor &amp; Gamble, to encourage all witnesses to step forward and testify freely without fear of retaliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.284" offset="3662401">There are two possible impediments to look toward under this criterion.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.673" offset="3687896">One is whether the danger of personal liability might discourage a witness from testifying freely, and that seems unlikely in this context if a witness, even himself not the target, were to disclose that he was a party to tax fraud, or engaged in tax fraud himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.256" offset="3802208">Regardless of whether that information could be disclosed to the IRS for civil purposes, it could possibly lead to criminal proceedings against that witness for tax fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.422" offset="3846930">It is hard to see that there is a substantial additional deterrent placed on the witness if he knows that it might also lead to an assessment of a tax deficiency against him for collection purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.744" offset="3912236">With respect to the possible retaliation from employers or other persons because the witness disclosed a wrong-doing that he knew about, this is something that has already been disclosed in the grand jury to attorneys for the government, and because under 6(e) the further disclosure would be under the protection of a court order and would be requested by the United States Attorney himself who has an interest in protecting witnesses against retaliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.619" offset="4079733">Protective provisions could be included in the court order.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.069" offset="4101467">There could be deletions made from what is disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.645" offset="4119752">There is because of the participation of the court--</text>

            <text syncTime="2155.894" offset="8768817">We have no quarrel with the duty of IRS to collect taxes, but there is nothing to collect here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2332.415" offset="9474854">Now, it is important to remember that the taxpayer, Mr. Baggot, did not plead to any tax-related violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.896" offset="9512784">He plead to two commodity violations, and that information is set forth at page 3A in our appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.987" offset="9545176">There is no tax-related violation, and the Solicitor General is wrong when he says that there was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.999" offset="9573179">There were two commodity violations for bid rigging or what they call wash trades.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.685" offset="9595958">Now, one reason the government does not qualify under the preliminary to exception arises from the unique statutory provisions of IRS.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.961" offset="9637023">Congress provided that IRS has no right or no ability to initiate litigation over a civil tax liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.269" offset="9686342">That right belongs exclusively to the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.471" offset="9699090">Even if IRS wanted to go to court and sue somebody for paying their taxes, they cannot do it by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.280" offset="9726361">The procedure arises thusly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.216" offset="9738064">Normally, not in this case, an examination takes place of a return, and IRS decides whether they may compute a proposed deficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.695" offset="9788010">If they decide there is a proposed deficiency a preliminary notice of that proposed deficiency is sent to the taxpayer, and he then has an opportunity to come in and talk to that examiner and settle or pay, or he can appeal within the IRS administrative procedure to their appeals office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.343" offset="9886544">If he is unsuccessful there in negotiating and if he does not want to pay, IRS then issues what is called a 90-day notice of deficiency and that officially determines the amount of the deficiency.</text>

            <text syncTime="3601.682" offset="14551909">He asked this Court to clear up the confusion created by 6(e), and that is what lead to the 1977 amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.085" offset="14589525">And those 1977 amendments said, yes, give it to IRS for criminal purposes, but when that access is gone, it stays with the U. S.

            <text syncTime="3631.779" offset="14672386">That was the whole purpose of the 1977 amendment, and there was not any routine disclosure at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.823" offset="14696523">The preliminary to rule has remained unchanged since it was promulgated in 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="3646.305" offset="14730482">Mr. Wallace is right when he says there is nothing in the history or nothing in the Advisory notes that gives you any indication what Congress thought about.</text>

            <text syncTime="3671.904" offset="14832882">And, I suggest to this Court that the traditional practice of grand jury secrecy did not include turning the stuff over to IRS to use for civil purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3727.507" offset="15055236">That gets difficult, and the Chief Justice asked a question earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3732.567" offset="15075507">He said, well how can he take it out of this side of their mind and put it over in the other side of their mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3737.471" offset="15095152">And, the quick answer is, they cannot, but I think Congress was trying to do the best they could to see that they would so there would not be any abusive practices in the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3750.044" offset="15145411">Another thing I would like to speak to is he said his experience is that U. S. Attorneys cannot be manipulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3757.821" offset="15176549">I was a federal prosecutor, both with the Anti-trust Division and the Strike Force for ten years, and I have been handling grand jury matters for another 18 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3768.459" offset="15219076">Manipulation is as easy as an IRS saying to the United States Attorney, subpoena the records from this bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="3776.283" offset="15250319">It may have nothing to do with his Title 18 investigation, but it would certainly help the civil investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3784.857" offset="15284696">As a normal matter, a U. S. Attorney could care less, and I use that very advisedly, about tax violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3793.229" offset="15318133">He is interested in Title 18 violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3797.149" offset="15333806">For example, let's take an extortion case, or let's take a bribery case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3801.680" offset="15351987">His questions are who did you pay, and how much did you pay him, and why did you pay him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3808.552" offset="15379468">If a witness knows that IRS is going to be listening at the door and get all of those grand jury secrets, he is going to be very reluctant to speak, and that goes to the fourth reason for secrecy, the impact on the testimony of witnesses should be full and frank.</text>
            <text syncTime="3823.514" offset="15439236">Because he does not have any problem saying maybe, or at least he has reached a point saying, alright I am involved in a crime, and I will tell you about this bribery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3833.464" offset="15479047">I paid this public official.</text>
            <text syncTime="3835.134" offset="15485734">But, if he thinks IRS is going to carry his house and his car away, he is going to be very reluctant to talk about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3842.085" offset="15513529">And, that holds over to all grand jury actions that involve money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3846.614" offset="15531710">What you are doing is giving IRS a partnership in the grand jury proceeding, and I suggest that traditional grand jury history and secrecy as set forth by this Court in many, many cases, Colandra and U. S. v. Johnson, Blair, and Proctor &amp; Gamble, and Pittsburgh Plate Glass, never contemplated such a thing.</text>
