            <text syncTime="59.601" offset="389370">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the question presented by this case is whether state-created pretransfer procedures prior to an interstate transfer of an inmate implicate a liberty interest protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.015" offset="459065">We believe that the Court should not so broaden the concepts of the due process clause to so extend it to mere procedures prior to interstate transfer where there is no underlying substantive liberty interest at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.663" offset="525625">Now, Delbert Kaahanui Wakinekona is a maximum control, maximum security inmate of the Hawaii prison system.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.707" offset="565853">He is serving multiple terms for crimes including life without parole for murder in 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.188" offset="599708">He was in 1976 an inmate of the maximum control unit of the Hawaii State Prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.388" offset="628547">The maximum control unit was a prison within the Hawaii State Prison System, a small prison with its own programs, with its own walls within the institution to house maximum security type inmates.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.522" offset="689047">On August 2, 1976, there was a series of hearings conducted by what is called the Program Committee, which is not unlike the type of committees you see in almost every prison system throughout the land, to ascertain why the programs within the maximum control unit had failed.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.687" offset="765742">Mr. Wakinekona, along with every other inmate of the maximum control unit, were interviewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.480" offset="792910">Subsequently, the same committee provided notice to Mr. Wakinekona that within five days they would hold a hearing to determine whether his classification within the system should be altered, and whether or not he should be transferred to another part of the prison system, another prison within Hawaii, or transferred interstate.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.173" offset="887682">A hearing was held before this committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.188" offset="899698">He was represented by an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.185" offset="915685">He was provided opportunity to respond to all of the provisions set forth in the notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.508" offset="945047">He was advised why they were considering certain actions about him.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.650" offset="961556">And ultimately, after the hearing was concluded, he received a notice of recommendations on his security classification that it should remain as maximum, that he continued to be a security risk within the Hawaii prison system, and that because of major changes that were going to be undertaken by the system, and that is, to terminate the maximum control unit, pending construction of the State of Hawaii's new master plan, master correctional plan, that because there would be no programs available in Hawaii for maximum control inmates, there would be no institution set up for maximum control type inmates, that they recommended that Mr. Wakinekona be transferred to a mainland facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.801" offset="1154131">That recommendation was followed by the administrator, the final decision-maker under Rule 4 of our rules, Mr. Antone Olim, who made the decision to transfer Mr. Wakinekona to Folsome Prison in California--</text>

            <text syncTime="298.890" offset="1346497">There is an adjustment process in Hawaii for your traditional disciplinary type actions, where the committee makes actual decisions to punish inmates based upon substantial evidence of rule violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.542" offset="1401145">That is to be contrasted with the Program Committee process, which is under the classification process, where they review every inmate within the system on an ongoing basis to determine where that person best fits within the prison system, to determine what kind of classification he should have, and where he should be housed within the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.550" offset="1481184">It is a continuing... It is described, the classification process is described in its purpose as a dynamic process that provides a continuing evaluation of every inmate based upon a multiplicity of factors, one committed basically to the discretion of the officials.</text>

            <text syncTime="743.364" offset="3124391">The Hawaii Supreme Court specifically held that Rule 4 contained no standards, contained no limitations on discretion, was a mere procedural rule, and if you read it carefully, you have to come to the conclusion that the Supreme Court is saying that Mr. Wakinekona had absolutely no expectation, reasonable or otherwise, except for a unilateral one, in Hawaii laws, in Hawaii regulations, to remain in the Hawaii prison system, that the prison system has the absolute discretion, consistent only with constitutional standards, to transfer inmates to the mainland.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael A. Lilly</label>
            <text syncTime="809.573" offset="3389272">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.712" offset="3393870">The due process claim raised by the Respondent in this case is grounded in whether he has a liberty interest to remain in the Hawaii prison system as contemplated by the due process clause of the United States Constitution, and implicit in the notion of due process is the freedom of restraint in any significant way, such as, for example, in this Court's on parole and early release, for example, in Wolff.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.183" offset="3523751">And from Roth on, this Court has said that we look to the nature of the interest, and not the weight, and that is where grievousness seems to come into play, as to whether that constitutes a basis for a liberty interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.175" offset="3595640">Now, in last term, and I think I misspoke earlier, the Howe case, Howe versus Smith, had a companion case.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.940" offset="3626778">It was Hawaii versus Maderis, in which three Hawaii inmates were transferred to the federal system in Marion, Illinois, and it was... the same issue was raised in that case as was raised in Howe, and in light of Howe, Hawaii versus Maderis was remanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.885" offset="3678500">There was no suggestion in those cases that an interstate transfer was grievous in a constitutional sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.476" offset="3720923">Indeed, for purposes of arguing the grievous aspect of due process, if it is... has any vitality at all after the Iago decision, and after the Meachum decision, is that Wakinekona, Mr. Wakinekona would stand in no different position in this case than if he were a federal prisoner in Hawaii, and there being no federal prison in Hawaii, he would have been transferred interstate.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.821" offset="3826249">And Mr. Wakinekona is not irrevocably sent to California.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.775" offset="3842027">He still remains a Hawaii prisoner, and under the Western Interstate Corrections Compact, attached to our brief in this matter, he remains a Hawaii prisoner, and he remains under the Hawaii statutes and rules and regulations.</text>

            <text syncTime="978.952" offset="4066784">It was in some respects ambiguous, but at the time when these rules and regulations were adopted, there was no definitive ruling in a sense by this Court as to what was or was not a grievous loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.200" offset="4119760">Indeed, it seemed to be going in the direction of grievousness as having some kind of a liberty triggering process, and I think Hawaii had that in mind when that... those words were utilized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.849" offset="4162392">But even in Iago, it was decided that there was no question that he suffered a grievous loss, but that was not of a constitutional dimension.</text>
