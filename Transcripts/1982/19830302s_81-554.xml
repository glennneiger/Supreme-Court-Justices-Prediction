            <text syncTime="8.497" offset="126242">This is an appeal from the District Court for the District of Wyoming.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.795" offset="151424">The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against any employee or potential employee between the ages of 40 and 70 on the basis of age with a certain important exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.741" offset="243166">In 1974, the definition of "employer" under Section 11(b) of the Act was extended was extended by Congress to include state and local governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.358" offset="297710">After a supervisor for the Wyoming Game and Fish Department was involuntarily retired at age 55 pursuant to a Wyoming statute, he filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, alleging violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.012" offset="380257">The Commission ultimately filed suit in Federal District Court against the appellees, the State of Wyoming and various state officials, seeking relief on behalf of the supervisor and others similarly situated.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.545" offset="442428">The District Court dismissed the suit, holding that insofar as the Act regulated Wyoming's employment relationship with its game wardens and other law enforcement officials, it violated the doctrine of Tenth Amendment immunity articulated in National League of Cities versus Usery, a case decided by this Court a few terms ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.752" offset="539290">That case struck down Congress' attempt to extend the wage and hour provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act to state and local governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.684" offset="578996">We reverse the judgment of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.919" offset="595924">We hold that National League of Cities versus Usery is in applicable in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.372" offset="621733">Rather, we hold the extension of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act to cover state and local governments is a valid exercise of Congress' powers under the Commerce Clause, both on its face and as applied in this case, and is not precluded by virtue of external constraints imposed on Congress' commerce powers by the Tenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.348" offset="717654">Justice Stevens has joined the Court opinion and also filed a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.650" offset="742836">The Chief Justice has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Powell, Justice Rehnquist and Justice O'Connor have joined.</text>
