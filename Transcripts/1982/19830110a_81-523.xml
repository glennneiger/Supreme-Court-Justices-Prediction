            <text syncTime="70.082" offset="423375">May it please the Court, this is an appeal from the California Court of Appeals, the California Supreme Court having declined to hear the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.858" offset="466529">The Court of Appeals sustained the trial court in holding that Container Corporation of American, Appellant herein, and its foreign subsidiaries were engaged in one unitary business.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.963" offset="510937">However, the Court, in its opinion, based its opinion upon different legal standards than those adopted by this Court in the recent ASARCO and Woolworth cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.708" offset="561928">The Court also rejected Container's other constitutional arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.768" offset="590140">This case again presents the unitary business issue, but in a context different from ASARCO and Woolworth.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.201" offset="627861">There the cases involved taxation by a non-domociliary state of dividends from foreign subsidiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.916" offset="666731">Here a non-domociliary state, California, is attempting to combine the parent and foreign subsidiaries' income in one tax base and apportion part of that income to California by the payroll/property/sales formula.</text>

            <text syncTime="181.082" offset="867456">Here, as contrasted with ASARCO and Woolworth, there is immediate state taxation of the foreign subsidiaries' income even though it is not distributed to the parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.186" offset="923776">In regard to the unitary issue, Container... I want to say one more thing about the order of our arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.651" offset="965677">Container's position is that it may prevail on any one of the following arguments: First, under the due process clause because Container is not unitary with its foreign subsidiaries; second, under the due process clause because California is taxing extraterritorial income due to distortion in the formula; third, under the commerce clause because of double taxation; and, fourth, under the commerce clause because the California system prevents the United States from speaking with one voice in the field of foreign relations.</text>

            <text syncTime="271.062" offset="1227319">And, also, I think we would be making... The due process distortion argument is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.341" offset="1252397">In regard to the unitary argument, Container and its foreign subsidiaries are a separate business operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.696" offset="1289909">Now, I would say in regard to reviewing the facts, Container has no quarrel in general with the Court of Appeals' statement of fact except in a few instances noted in our main brief in which we believe the Court of Appeals made errors in its statement, but we believe we would prevail on the statement of facts in the Court of Appeals case.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.951" offset="1390846">We, of course, disagree with their legal conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.200" offset="1403907">In any event, we would invite the Court to read the record, which is rather short, comprising a stipulation of facts and uncontroverted testimony.</text>

            <label>Mr. Neal J. Gobar</label>
            <text syncTime="1648.870" offset="6738529">Mr. Acting Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.301" offset="6784295">Here, Container concedes, apparently for the purposes of domestic taxation, taxation of interstate commerce that is, and also it concedes for the purpose of taxing its own activities in Canada, that the formula apportionment method is proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.432" offset="6888785">However, it seeks preferential treatment, a special rule, for the major companies which are doing business in foreign countries through their subsidiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.114" offset="6935492">It apparently seeks to draw a distinction between its activities through a subsidiary in a foreign country and its activities which it does itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.454" offset="6988886">California applies the formulary apportionment method, the combined reporting method, uniformly to all businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.308" offset="7036325">It feels that such special treatment is inappropriate; that its treatment, its even-handed treatment of all unitary business operations is proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.070" offset="7079375">As indicated, there are two commerce clause arguments and there are two due process arguments presented by Plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.503" offset="7117095">We here will respond first to the commerce clause arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.891" offset="7142695">We will talk about them together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.795" offset="7158264">We feel they are answered substantially by this Court's decisions and language in the Mobil case, Bass, Ratcliff; and, secondly, we will go on to the discussion of the due process extraterritorial argument which we feel is most recently discussed and responded to in this Court's Exxon case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.254" offset="7252096">Thirdly, we will talk about unitary business facts which we feel are shown to clearly exist under this Court's most recent Woolworth statement of the rule and the test and the Butler Brothers case which clearly applies the unitary formula in a situation similar to this and we feel that the facts, as appear in the record, unlike those partial statements of facts which Your Honor has heard properly by an advocate this afternoon will clearly establish that we have a clear unitary business here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.172" offset="7447806">First, with respect to the commerce clause argument, these are predicated upon this Court's 1979 Japan Line argument and case and decision which did not involve a situation which we have here and we feel is not applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.665" offset="7525755">We feel this was recognized by this Court in the Mobil case as well as in the language of the Japan Line case itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.565" offset="7569327">That case, which involved a taxation of a foreign instrumentality which was in the United States solely while moving in foreign commerce, and had been subject pursuant to a specific convention to taxation in full at its place of domicile is certainly the opposite of what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.225" offset="7688028">We are here talking about taxing a unitary business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.630" offset="7701611">We are here talking about taxing an American company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.004" offset="7723136">The considerations before the Court in the Japan Line are not the considerations when we are taxing an American company who chooses to do business in foreign countries by setting up separate subsidiaries which it fully controls and operates as part of its unitary business rather than merely sending its own employees there as a division.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.273" offset="7828149">Unlike the Japan Line case, here we have no federal one voice which prevents combined reporting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.770" offset="7874124">As has been indicated by questions of the Court already, Congress has refused in any way, shape, or form to limit the power of the states to tax unitary businesses by formula apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.060" offset="7947371">Congress has had a number of bills before it for a number of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.464" offset="7964926">Congress is the appropriate person, the appropriate agency, to place limitations upon the state's right to tax... to use the formulary method of taxing particularly with respect to domestic corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.189" offset="8043815">The Executive Department at no time, not withstanding the contentions of the Solicitor General in a different case, at no time, to our knowledge, has suggested that there be any limitation placed upon the taxation by the state of income of a unitary business which is controlled by an American company such as Container here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.555" offset="8141304">To the best of our knowledge, only on one occasion was it suggested that even activities of any foreign-controlled company be subjected to a different treatment than the fair uniform treatment which we have by formula apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.453" offset="8212880">And, that case, as indicated, was rejected by the Senate and we have no knowledge of any attempt by the Executive Branch to pursue that matter further.</text>

            <text syncTime="2200.568" offset="8945353">My point, Your Honor, is that the unitary formula method should be applicable as California has uniformly applied it regardless of the activities... whether the unit... you have to have a unitary business, but regardless of whether the unit is operated through a single corporation or through a parent in a number of subsidiaries, the treatment has to be the same if they are both unitary businesses to avoid the ability, which the major companies here are trying to retain in this case, to shift their income by switching from a division situation, subject to formula apportionment while it is a loss, and as Your Honor pointed out, when they start they are losses, and you run your loss divisions in and that reduces your California tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="3495.502" offset="14125122">That is right, Your Honor, which certainly represents the position of the United States on this question of worldwide unitary apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.422" offset="14152811">And, it is perfectly clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.953" offset="14166917">He says in his brief,</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.154" offset="14171724">"if, as we submit, the court concludes that the Illinois combined reporting requirement, either, (a) creates a substantial risk of international multiple taxation, or, (b) impairs federal uniformity in the conduct of foreign relations. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.272" offset="14232119">"That is the end of the matter and the judgment below should be reversed. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.740" offset="14250091">That, of course, applies to a U.S. based company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.129" offset="14267646">The record in the case... Incidentally, the Solicitor General has questioned how... The Deputy Attorney General has stated that the record isn't clear how the tax returns were filed in the foreign countries, but I call Your Honor's attention to page 72, paragraph 140, of the Joint Appendix that says: "The returns were filed", and these were the returns by the subsidiaries</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.036" offset="14407244">"taking into account only the applicable income and deductions incurred by the subsidiary or subsidiaries in that country and not taking into account the income and deductions of CCA or the subsidiaries operating in other countries. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.296" offset="14472237">Mr. Gobar has also suggested that maybe the record isn't clear on the payment of taxes by these subsidiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.495" offset="14513092">I call the Court's attention to Joint Appendix, page 84, where, for the most part, and I mean in 90 % of the cases, the actual taxes paid by the subsidiaries are set forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.676" offset="14577771">So there is no question about the actual taxes being paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.220" offset="14595953">In a few instances, it shows the provision for taxes set up on the books, but those are distinctly a minority and certainly subject to the trusted NFA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.997" offset="14651019">I think the facts, and Mr. Gobar has mentioned something about the facts, I think the facts are clear and I needn't dwell on them any longer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.399" offset="14684664">I will stand on our factual statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.913" offset="14702741">The question of whether Congress should act in the area, here we have presented to the Court issues that this Court has resolved many, many times, double taxation, due process, distortion problems, the unitary question, those are all issues that this Court has addressed recently and in many times in the past and I would submit that they shouldn't be addressed again.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.339" offset="14816426">I think this is clearly a case where California is overreaching.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.478" offset="14833040">There is no question that it is taxing income earned outside the state and, indeed, outside the country in foreign countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.145" offset="14867626">And, there is no reason why this corporation should have to pay additional taxes simply because it is engaged in foreign commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.565" offset="14901376">That is certainly contrary to the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3693.001" offset="14915064">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
