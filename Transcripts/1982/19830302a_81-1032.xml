            <text syncTime="42.312" offset="317874">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="48.575" offset="342952">There are two issues before the Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.011" offset="356744">The first is whether attorneys in the Civil Division of the Department of Justice may have access as of right to grand jury material as attorneys for the government pursuant to Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 6(e)(3)(A)(i) and 54(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="70.472" offset="430514">The second issue is what standard the Civil Division must meet to show grand jury material to assisting personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.000" offset="460607">If the Court rules against us on the first issue, then the second issue also concerns what standard the Division must meet for access by its own attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.746" offset="503657">It is our position that this case does not involve a question of grand jury secrecy, but instead concerns how the Attorney General organizes the Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.633" offset="547229">Briefly, the facts were that Respondents, Sells, Witte, and Sells Engineering Corporation were indicted on a number of counts of tax fraud and fraud against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.281" offset="609818">There were other persons who were also indicted along with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.062" offset="624865">Sells and Witte were officers in Sells Engineering Corporation which had contracts with the Department of the Navy to produce defense systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.494" offset="670632">The Defendants moved to quash the indictments making various allegations of grand jury abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.476" offset="698530">The main allegation seems to have been at the time they were complaining about an indictment based on hearsay, it appears.</text>

            <text syncTime="146.737" offset="735624">Is the term grand jury abuse a word of art?</text>
            <text syncTime="149.627" offset="747118">I noticed it in the opinion of the Ninth Circuit in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="157.249" offset="777629">I believe in this case, Respondents are the first ones who used it.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.746" offset="799676">I believe it is unclear what they mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.995" offset="812633">As I say, they claim that apparently they thought the grand jury had been used for an improper purpose by the U.S. Attorney's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.445" offset="854429">I think that is what they mean by abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.990" offset="872610">Even though they made this motion to quash the indictment, Sells and Witte withdrew the motion and pleaded guilty to a count of conspiracy to commit fraud against the government by inhibiting investigation... a tax investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.666" offset="979294">Shortly before the guilty pleas were entered, the Civil Division of the Department of Justice came into the District Court where the criminal proceedings were pending and sought access to the grand jury materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.240" offset="1037600">The Division sought the materials because it thought that it might need them in order to bring a false claims action against some of the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.812" offset="1087859">As far as other defendants were concerned, one other defendant pleaded guilty and another defendant was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.247" offset="1117639">In order to avoid any confusion, I think it would be important at this point to look precisely at Rule 6(e) itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="642.290" offset="2717796">I think that there are two ways of looking at that, and I think either one supports our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.757" offset="2747680">One is that they do not mean precisely the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.066" offset="2760950">Rule 6(d), I think, is what you are referring to which sets out who can be in the grand jury room.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.718" offset="2799507">Clearly, Rule 6(e) cannot mean that only attorneys who were in the grand jury room can have access to the grand jury materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.856" offset="2836078">The reason I say that is a situation often happens where a Department of Justice attorney handles a presentation to the grand jury, and then that attorney leaves government service.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.899" offset="2884248">Now, obviously, a new attorney has to be appointed in order to handle the criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.224" offset="2909534">It is clear under Rule 6(e) that the new attorney who was not in the grand jury room and since at the time he had nothing to do with handling the grand jury probably should not have been in the grand jury room, could nonetheless have access to the grand jury materials in order to prepare the criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.964" offset="2996470">Another way of looking at it is to say that the section do mean the same, and there is nothing in Rule 6(d) that would prohibit a Department of Justice, Civil Division attorney from sitting in during a grand jury presentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.676" offset="3067314">Now, that is not the practice of the Department of Justice, mostly because we wish to avoid any appearance that a grand jury is being used for civil purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="929.191" offset="3865407">Very often, the Civil Division attorneys will look at the material and decide that there is no false claims action here and so they will drop the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1640.590" offset="6710978">The Department of Justice has both civil and criminal responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.696" offset="6727487">Attorneys within the Department of Justice can be assigned civil responsibilities or criminal responsibilities or both at any time by the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.927" offset="6768343">And, in fact, in many cases, both in smaller United States Attorneys offices and in a number of divisions of the Department of Justice, many attorneys operate every day on those dual responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.390" offset="6822259">The result of the order here, all that it would be is that it would force the Attorney General to restructure the Civil Frauds Unit and combine it with criminal fraud... the Criminal Fraud Unit, and under the Proctor and Gamble decision the attorney then would clearly have access as of right to the grand jury material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.772" offset="6915778">So, that all the decision does here and all Respondent position does is interfere with how the Attorney General is going to organize the Justice Department.</text>

            <text syncTime="2500.272" offset="10149737">The second level of concern we have is combining Baggot and this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.988" offset="10184636">In Baggot they are saying the IRS is doing this preliminary to the judicial proceeding when they are doing a tax investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.264" offset="10217760">That is the case you are going to hear argued next.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.200" offset="10229463">How you decide that, coupled with the rationally related aspect of their question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.541" offset="10258824">If you decide rationally related is fine and administrative proceedings are preliminary to judicial proceedings, and, therefore, they get it under 6(e)(3)(C)(i), then we have an administrative agency in there using the grand jury, this forthwith subpoena power, the power of the absolute monarch to collect taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.488" offset="10338654">Is that what we want?</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.908" offset="10348267">Are we going to use that kind of a power to collect taxes?</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.093" offset="10373032">Now, we really have here an issue of the ex parte power dual use of the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.853" offset="10424023">This issue is squarely joined in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.711" offset="10439487">It is squarely joined, whether you know it or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.303" offset="10449832">They have cited Proctor &amp; Gamble, which was a dual use case that I want to talk about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.770" offset="10475745">And, in the Baggot brief at page 12 of the summary of their argument, read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.925" offset="10492359">You know what they tell you?</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.346" offset="10498001">The government states there that it has been a very effective way for agencies to perform its dual enforcement programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.325" offset="10537916">They say there that the agency assistance must be bought, bought by delivering up the fruits of the investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.368" offset="10578145">They say there that if you do not do that the IRS will threaten to stop providing that assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.241" offset="10609596">Do you know what they say there?</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.099" offset="10617015">They say there that the 6(e) amendment in 1977 which Congress said very clearly should not be used for civil purposes, they say wipe it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.687" offset="10671350">That is what they say there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.000" offset="10676679">That issue is joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.500" offset="10682635">Let me talk about this triad that I mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.746" offset="10699667">The first leg is Proctor &amp; Gamble.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.651" offset="10707294">Proctor &amp; Gamble is important to the government for the purposes of the triad because the government says that Proctor &amp; Gamble said that private parties are the only ones that have to show particularized and compelling need, while the government hides behind it and uses it for civil purposes any and every way it desires.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.502" offset="10806664">That is the first leg of the triad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.704" offset="10819516">They also say that Proctor &amp; Gamble stands for the proposition that automatic access has been approved by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.417" offset="10862357">Nonsense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.917" offset="10868313">And I want to take you through that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.791" offset="10871866">But, first, on this triad, what is it?</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.118" offset="10889107">It is Proctor &amp; Gamble.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.164" offset="10897361">It is a 1977 6(e) amendment, and it is Sells and Baggot if you grant them what they want, they have full and complete and total executive control of the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.160" offset="10953263">The active agency participation was decided... it may not be constitutional... but it was decided in the 1977 amendment of 6(e) that any agency personnel for any reason can be brought in without a court order and without court supervision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.259" offset="11037691">Secondly, the dual purpose subpoena power, that is the issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.241" offset="11061619">Third, easy, wholesale access to all of it, that is at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.583" offset="11090981">Fourth, civil administrative proceedings being preliminary, too, that is an issue in Baggot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.862" offset="11116058">Restricted private party access, but, of course, just private party access under particularized and compelling, that was in Proctor &amp; Gamble, so the government says.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.795" offset="11163810">And, of course, they proceed to use it in cases like Saconni Vacuum and so forth as they desire with a very limited and restrictive capability of defending against it as far as the other side is concerned, because they hover and hold it all here and let it be looked at in camera, et cetera while they use it to refresh witnesses and witnesses, by the way, which without attorney being present were asked leading questions who framed their answers in that context and then became married to them, not in the adversary proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.672" offset="11295363">And then they are stuck with them later for they are inconsistent and their credibility is gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.529" offset="11318769">What we have got here is the camel's head went under the tent when the prosecutor came into the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.900" offset="11344264">In the 1977 6(e) amendment, the whole camel went in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.821" offset="11359938">The government says, we are watching the chicken coop, the fox, and we will let you know if we are going to let you have materials or not, and we will eat them whenever we want.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.113" offset="11401107">And, besides that, the government says we the executive, we monitor the grand jury and we run the show and we are the tail wagging the dog.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.485" offset="11442589">That is what the government says.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.233" offset="11453561">Proctor &amp; Gamble is the first leg of this triad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.466" offset="11466517">It held that civil use was okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.668" offset="11479369">It held that particularized and compelling need must be applied to grand jury materials because of the necessity of retaining the secrecy doctrine that came into the Constitution with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.865" offset="11540078">What was the real focus in Proctor &amp; Gamble?</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.052" offset="11552826">The certified question was very narrow, whether good cause requires Rule 34 production by government for grand jury testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.031" offset="11596816">Very narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.812" offset="11603921">There were prior motions two years ago... before, I should say... two years before, where Proctor &amp; Gamble tried to suppress and tried to get returned and argued that it was wrong for them to have it and all of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.808" offset="11647912">They were denied by Judge Moradelli who thought, gee, government cannot be wrong... denied by Moradelli.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.257" offset="11677691">Two years later he was accusing the government of having a plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.332" offset="11701933">That is in Volume 50, Case 51 of the 1957-58 up in the library.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.751" offset="11735683">Look at Moradelli's decision in the case below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.234" offset="11749580">It came straight up to this Court under the Expediting Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.108" offset="11761074">Now, look at the brief of American Association of Soap Manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.309" offset="11789913">It tells you precisely the dual purpose that was going on down there in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.307" offset="11809871">There were alot of other issues that the majority ducked because it could not reach agreement, I suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.537" offset="11842785">Perhaps Justice Brennan can tell you better.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.989" offset="11852607">But, there were three dissents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.488" offset="11874654">Harlan, Burton, and Frankfurter said, hey, why are we disturbing that sound discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.718" offset="11903494">Look at this one-reason opinion of the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.233" offset="11913629">Besides that, the government is a recalcitrant party, and they will not cooperate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.951" offset="11928467">Why are we disturbing that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3009.065" offset="12184885">It was not discussed by the majority at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.978" offset="12116548">Justice Whittaker said that possession and property is not that of the Justice Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.258" offset="12145701">It is in the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.473" offset="12162524">Justice Whittaker said that equal discovery treatment should be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.517" offset="12194707">The thing that was not discussed by anybody was under what process of procedure should the government be able to get this material.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.857" offset="12232114">But, what process of procedure should the attorney for the government be using it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.465" offset="12246534">That was not the issue here because that was the issue two years earlier, and it did not come up on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.151" offset="12265237">It just wasn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.776" offset="12271716">And, this Court had a hard time coming to grips with the one thing they did decide or two.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.226" offset="12289583">Look at the major issues they did not want to try to wrestle with or could not wrestle with at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.130" offset="12309123">It was a strongly divided Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.848" offset="12320094">It was clearly a dual purpose grand jury case situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.080" offset="12340992">It was the first leg of the triad because, as far as the government is concerned, it said nobody else out there can have this material but us except on a particularized and compelling need.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.140" offset="12381221">Now, the government argued that because they argued the Rose five reasons for grand jury secrecy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.198" offset="12429495">The Rose five reasons they argued emphasized the fourth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.492" offset="12450602">The fourth reason being for witness protection and with the emphasis on because future grand juries will be ineffective unless we preserve the secrecy of this material.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.299" offset="12497832">Now, I do not think there is any question that that stood for the proposition of secrecy and it applied to all concerned, but that is not how the government has been applying it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.279" offset="12545792">Now, the government was in a role reversal situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.995" offset="12564601">They were the ones that argued secrecy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.573" offset="12574945">They were the ones urging Rose 4, and they were the ones talking about the future of the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.039" offset="12600858">They were the ones that suggested the words compelling necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.364" offset="12622070">Look at their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.396" offset="12626249">Now, let's talk about the 1977 Rule 6(e), if I can for a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.891" offset="12656238">This is the second leg of the triad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.250" offset="12669613">They urged that Congress ratify their continuing automatic access which nobody ever gave them in the first place, subselliantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.606" offset="12711095">Nobody ever gave it to them in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.793" offset="12723843">They say that the 1977 amendments that the Congress ratified it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.431" offset="12742338">They say so because of lack of parallel construction between (A)(1) and (A) double toothpicks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.382" offset="12762191">That is how they argue it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.818" offset="12767938">First, the only and single issue addressed in the 1977 hearing... 1976 hearings on 1977... was whether or not there should be technical personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.173" offset="12813391">There was a colloquy between Professor Wayne LeFave and Congresswoman Holsmith that is very telling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.638" offset="12851216">It was under the original draft of the Advisory Committee with regard to... including under the term, attorneys for the government... technical personnel as they deem necessary all in the performance of the attorney's duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.291" offset="12897818">And she says, isn't there a possibility that, for example, an IRS agent will be confused about what the duties are, and he will think it is duty to do civil work?</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.676" offset="12939405">And, Professor Wayne LeFave said,</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.284" offset="12957796">"That is a legitimate concern. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.253" offset="12965632">"Maybe the language ought to be changed to make this clearer than it is. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.155" offset="12989247">And that is exactly what they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.811" offset="12999905">The other thing that is important is Richard Thornberg, acting Deputy Attorney General, gave testimony to that Committee... and I am addressing these two witnesses because I think their testimony is critical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.276" offset="13041805">Thornberg told the Committee, giving two examples, it would be our policy to always get a 6(e) order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.849" offset="13076078">And, the clearest example I can give you is if there is a civil fraud action and we cannot make the case criminally, and we have to go after it civilly, we will come in and get a 6(e) order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.985" offset="13128636">Then, he contrasted that, of course, the prototype here is the IRS with the agency involved and we would also have to get a 6(e) order for the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.262" offset="13169701">I submit to you that is the Sells case, civil fraud and IRS, Sells I and Sells II.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.931" offset="13200421">That is what is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.665" offset="13207317">And, the issue here is should they get a 6(e) order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.960" offset="13224454">Look at that testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.896" offset="13236261">It is very telling in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.756" offset="13243680">Now, I would like to talk briefly just about duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.316" offset="13269907">Duty is a limiting word.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.096" offset="13281087">It is duty in the criminal context of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 6(e), which was designed purely for a criminal function.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.358" offset="13314106">We are talking here about the client, the function, and the duty of the Department of Justice which is all over the place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.338" offset="13350050">Duty is anything from HUD, EPA, special assistant to the grand jury to civil fraud to Tax Division to anti-trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.381" offset="13394145">It is every duty you can imagine a lawyer performs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.817" offset="13403967">So, we are talking about the client, function, and duty, not titles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.441" offset="13422462">Isn't the duty of an agency attorney equally as important in the collection of taxes or SEC or otherwise as the duty of the Justice Department when he is doing the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.342" offset="13466034">It is not titles that is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.294" offset="13477841">It is duty, client, and function.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.887" offset="13488186">I have already addressed what I believe to be a fake issue, so I will leave that one alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.009" offset="13508666">Let me talk briefly about attorney abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.883" offset="13520160">Attorney abuse is claimed here, not just IRS abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.272" offset="13549730">If you go to the Statement, Part B of our red brief, you will see there that none of that could have happened without the active participation and assistance of the U. S. Attorney's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.391" offset="13598214">Subpoenas were issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.157" offset="13605319">Every witness virtually was diverted to an intelligent IRS agent for examination and interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.544" offset="13634785">In one situation where the record on the affidavits and transcript in these proceedings, the record demonstrates that the AUSA participated in diversion of a witness to the IRS agent when there was not really a grand jury panel that was ever going to hear it any way, because he says himself the first time we intended to schedule anything was March, and this was going on in January, and the old panel had terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.845" offset="13748052">That is in Part B of the Statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.547" offset="13758814">They accuse us of a blunderbuss assault.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.123" offset="13773129">Yes, do you know what a blunderbuss is?</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.169" offset="13781280">A large bore, an old-fashioned weapon with a big muzzle when loaded with a lot of ball is very effective at close range.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.635" offset="13815239">I accept that definition, and those balls all hit their mark, and they will not touch them with a ten foot pole because that statement is documented to affidavits of the government and transcript 99 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.944" offset="13860378">The sixth reason for secrecy, very important here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.629" offset="13883157">One more to add to Rose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.815" offset="13887964">It was said by Justice Whittaker, to eliminate the temptation to conduct grand jury investigations as a means of ex parte procurement of direct or derivative evidence for use in a contemplated civil suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.355" offset="13946060">Add it to the other five, because there is a ground swell out there that is begging you to add it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.119" offset="13973123">The lower courts, many of them have come down with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.929" offset="13984408">The Seventh and the Ninth in Baggot and here... excuse me, Miller, Baggot in the Seventh... and the Ninth here have said it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.849" offset="14012098">And, there are many courts and legal commentators that have said it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.286" offset="14025786">Add it.</text>

            <label>Mr. Douglas N. Letter</label>
            <text syncTime="3523.733" offset="14243543">I have several brief points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.233" offset="14249603">First, I just want to point out, Mr. Robbins talked about the policies of grand jury secrecy being implicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.539" offset="14290772">Our position in no way interferes with grand jury secrecy because as Justice Marshall has pointed out a couple of times, the government already has the grand jury material.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.770" offset="14339778">We are talking about giving it from one Department of Justice attorney to another Department of Justice attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.705" offset="14359422">Witnesses testifying before the grand jury are not concerned that their testimony will be seen by one Department of Justice attorney as opposed to the one in the office next door.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.169" offset="14405293">What this Court has said in the Pittsburgh Plate Glass case is the concern is that the witness' employer or the target in the in the investigation will see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.196" offset="14449387">I cannot emphasize strongly enough, we already have the material, and it is just given from one attorney to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.270" offset="14481779">Second, we are relying on the majority opinion in Proctor &amp; Gamble.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.346" offset="14502050">The concurring opinion of Justice Whittaker I do not think helps Mr. Robbins very much, but we are looking at the majority opinion, pages 683 and 684 that Mr. Robbins apparently is ignoring, and I think that they are directly on point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.886" offset="14572163">Finally, in further answer to Justice O'Connor's question earlier, in the Baggot case we are seeking... the IRS seeks the information for tax assessment purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.145" offset="14633185">The Department of Justice, Tax Division does not do tax assessment purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.191" offset="14653456">If the Department were going to get into that that would have to be arranged by Congress which could obviously take care of any problems at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.484" offset="14686579">So, I do not think that that is a problem here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.295" offset="14701835">Does the Court have any further questions?</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.514" offset="14710716">Thank you.</text>
