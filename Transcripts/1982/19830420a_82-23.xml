            <text syncTime="6.295" offset="172512">Mr. Cronk, I think you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <text syncTime="62.505" offset="397374">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="66.379" offset="412943">This matter is here on petition for certiorari to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.705" offset="434154">It derived from an action brought by Respondent, a member of the Nebraska legislature, over three years ago by which he sought to challenge the legislature's traditional method of opening each legislative day's sitting with a brief invocation offered by a cleric chaplain, a non-legislator officer of the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.006" offset="551392">The basis of that challenge was that legislative prayers employed by the legislature in that manner per se violated the establishment clause of the First Amendment.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="112.735" stopTime="119.749">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="112.735" offset="598307">On the basis of his claim, would it make any difference whether it was a paid or an unpaid clergyman?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="shanler_d_cronk" startTime="119.749" stopTime="214.289">
            <label>Mr. Shanler D. Cronk</label>
            <text syncTime="119.749" offset="626415">Senator Chambers' precise claim was that the prayers, apparently definitionally being a per se violation of the Constitution, by practical operation obviated the necessity for compensating anyone to provide them, obviated the necessity obviously, again, from practical considerations of even having a prayer book, and in that way the compensation of the chaplain would fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.187" offset="772178">It's pretty clear from the record that his case focused exclusively on the proposition that prayers, at least the prayers offered by the then chaplain, the only ones that we have any evidence of in the record, themselves violated the Constitution, so obviously we now would have no reason to compensate anybody to give them, at least Reverend Palmer.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.944" offset="867160">I do not believe and I do not think the record reflects any independent basis for invalidating the compensation of the chaplain, and I think that the Court of Appeals realized somewhat of an incongruity in declining to rule the legislative prayers per se unconstitutional and at the same time finding a fault with their compensation, in the absence of any independent basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.136" offset="967888">I think it is pretty clear that the Court of Appeals attempted to link the compensation problem with the tenure of Chaplain Palmer.</text>

            <label>Mr. Shanler D. Cronk</label>
            <text syncTime="218.631" offset="1021909">It changed from time to time.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.723" offset="1034239">At the time of filing the action, it was approximately $320 per month.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.548" offset="1057540">The legislature sits in biannual sessions, the first year four months, the second year three months.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="235.061" offset="1087633">So it is seven months, $320.</text>

            <label>Mr. Shanler D. Cronk</label>
            <text syncTime="238.685" offset="1102157">Roughly, seven months per two-year session.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.527" offset="1117517">As I mentioned, I think it is pretty clear from the Court of Appeals decision that the per se challenge initiated by the Respondent was rejected by the court and instead, surprising in view of the case that was presented at trial, the Court of Appeals singled out principally an additional factor, and that was the retention and compensation of a particular chaplain for an extended period of time, without any indication of what constituted an extended period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.261" offset="1280417">We are to conclude from the opinion that 16 years at least is such an extended period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.821" offset="1306644">There are some particular facts in the record that should be briefly alluded to because they bear directly on what facts and circumstances at all appear in the record relevant to that basis for the court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.392" offset="1368920">The chaplaincy practice has existed in Nebraska since 1855, 12 years before statehood.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.984" offset="1395356">At the time of filing the action, the chaplain, along with three other non-legislator traditional officers, the other three being the clerk, the assistant clerk and the sergeant at arms, were recommended at the beginning of each biannual session by the legislature's Executive Board, its administrative oversight body, for the legislature's full approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.176" offset="1496084">These individuals were essentially treated as employees of the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.487" offset="1513325">They were compensated as part of the usual process by which the legislature compensated its employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.532" offset="1549478">And the evidence I think is quite clear, although it's not overly abundant, that the legislature itself had never considered over the course of time the post of chaplain or any particular individual's retention as chaplain as an issue of substantive importance in the legislative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.647" offset="1634010">We have not one hint of any controversy, of any complaint, any concern about either the post of chaplain or any particular chaplain whatsoever prior to the time that Respondent, as a member of the Executive Board in 1979, attempted to get that body to recommend that the post be totally eliminated and, as he put it, failing that at least compensation.</text>

            <text syncTime="480.947" offset="2071196">The only thing we know about any prior chaplain is that Chaplain Palmer himself became a candidate for the post because of the death of his predecessor in office.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.912" offset="2107036">One of the important facts relevant to the Court of Appeals' basis for this conclusion is simply the fact that over the entire some 130 year history of the Nebraska chaplaincy, in keeping with the fact that the legislative post and any particular individual had never caused any concern from the public or from the legislature, the practice developed that the chaplain, as well as the other non-legislator traditional officers, would be reappointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.006" offset="2267427">Both Respondent Senator Chambers and Executive Board Chairman Lewis indicated that it simply was the common practice that the four incumbents to the office would be slated again, unless there was an objection from somebody.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.719" offset="2322285">All that was needed in order to have the Executive Board recommend an incumbent for an ensuing session of the legislature was a five to four vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.825" offset="2358647">There simply had never been any objection to that process, which I think is reflective of the fact that it had never engendered any controversy or concern whatsoever up to this point, up to the filing of the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.944" offset="2411205">Chaplain Palmer, who has served since 1965, clearly indicated that he became a candidate for the vacancy at that time as an individual, not as a representative of his church.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.422" offset="2473063">His church allows him to become involved in civic activities to the extent his time permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.202" offset="2488214">It's in that capacity that he has served.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.670" offset="2502112">The only evidence that is in the record concerning Chaplain Palmer's own individual retention comes from the Executive Board Chairman, Frank Lewis, who had been a member of the legislature since 1972 and was Chairman of the Executive Board at time of trial in 1979, that Palmer had simply been reappointed because he had done a good job, very much consistent with what the usual process was.</text>

            <text syncTime="688.865" offset="2902830">The Petitioners have always maintained that, on the basis of this particular record and on the basis of any record that could have been developed by any different approach to this establishment clause challenge to the legislative practice, that it stands in its entirety, and is not changed by specific analysis on any one of its several components, as essentially a tradition of the legislature, more steeped in ceremony than actually any substantive import, by which the legislature has sought to begin each day's business in a solemn tone, hopefully setting an attitude of high purpose, although Chaplain Palmer quite readily admits that he would be hard pressed to admit that happens on all occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.388" offset="3136887">And the fact that Chaplain Palmer has served in his post does not change that fact, the fact that he served for some 16 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.978" offset="3167294">Fundamental, we believe, in this analysis is recognition of several historical considerations which clearly are relevant because of the fact that legislative chaplaincies substantially, if not virtually, identical to that in Nebraska have a rich history in our national heritage.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.376" offset="3248900">I think the importance with regard to certain activities that are interpreted under the religion clauses today that have such a history, of an investigation into that history and of a taking into account in the establishment clause analysis of that history, has been clearly indicated by this Court in cases such as Walz versus Maryland... Walz versus Tax Commissioner and McGowan versus Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.945" offset="3347121">And I believe the factors that were singled out there and that played a substantial part in the decisions in those Courts are also existent here and were totally ignored by the Court of Appeals, which fundamentally flawed its analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.563" offset="3409605">We do have the benefit of examining an activity today that not only existed at the time the framers were drafting the First Amendment, but was actually practiced by them at the very time the First Amendment was drafted.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.618" offset="3477837">The existence of evidence contemporaneous with the drafting of any particular amendment which we are today attempting to interpret was recently underscored by this Court in the Minneapolis Star and Tribune case.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.363" offset="3540845">I think the record before the Court quite convincingly indicates that three days before the final wording of the First Amendment was settled on, including the religion clauses, the very same framers enacted legislation compensating the officers of both of their houses, including chaplains.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.620" offset="3621824">Even some 15 years prior to that time, the First Continental Congress employed or utilized a cleric to begin its legislative sessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.599" offset="3673756">He was compensated at the end of his tenure and his tenure was for a number of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.643" offset="3701968">Subsequent to the drafting of the First Amendment and the convening of the first Congress under the Constitution, the federal practice has been virtually identical to that that has been employed in Nebraska.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.280" offset="3756512">Equally important is the fact that the same activity, the same practice in substantially identical form, has enjoyed widespread acceptance throughout the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.790" offset="3794546">The amicus brief filed by the National Conference of State Legislatures reaffirms what had previously been noted in the decisions of a few courts construing cases such as this, that legislative bodies in every state traditionally have opened their legislative daily sessions with prayer, that over half of them have compensated the individuals performing that service, and--</text>

            <text syncTime="1328.420" offset="5461054">The Plaintiff, Respondent here, challenged the expenditure of state funds for the prayer book.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.933" offset="5495117">He specifically requested relief that the expenditure of funds be enjoined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.930" offset="5515075">The district court judgment I believe purports to enjoin not only the expenditure of funds but the printing of the prayer book.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.956" offset="5559170">Being of the view that the printing of the prayer book has never been an official part of the legislative chaplaincy anyway, that matter was not appealed to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.546" offset="5609534">We have been of that view for the reason that in three years during the latter portion of Dr. Palmer's tenure individuals on the floor of the legislature, not pursuant to any legislative rules, apparently toward the end of the session got up and said: I think it would be a good idea if maybe we had some of these printed up for our own use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.194" offset="5692185">It is indicated on page 32 or 33 of Reverend Palmer's deposition, Exhibit 5 on the record, that the request was that these books be prepared for the legislators' use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.905" offset="5758954">Apparently some of them felt that it had been somewhat inspirational and they thought it would be nice to have copies of the thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.200" offset="5784136">Evidence of the fact that it was intended primarily for their use is quite clear from the print runs of the book.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.542" offset="5813602">The 1970 book, there were 100 copies that have been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.540" offset="5825514">This chain of events at the time the action was filed was not at all guaranteed to occur in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.396" offset="5865011">We had no idea whether anybody was going to get up and order that or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.004" offset="5879431">It simply wasn't, a part of this case as we viewed it, and for that reason we didn't appeal it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.863" offset="5890820">Because the Court of Appeals changed the analysis that the district court had undertaken and insisted that it had to consider the challenge against something called a prayer practice in its entirety, whatever the court meant by that, the prayer book issue was kind of dragged back into the fray.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.321" offset="5984652">Our position is that it is distinct from the legislative chaplaincy, it is distinct from the principal controlling factor by which the Court of Appeals decided this case, but even if it is considered on its merits, that the district court and the Court of Appeals were wrong to the extent that their decisions stand as a judgment that on an independent analysis those prayer books transcend the establishment clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.996" offset="6099382">I think that the record, portions of the record I have just cited, indicate there was a secular enough purpose for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.618" offset="6133863">To say that 100 of these books given to the legislators for their own personal use amounts to a direct and immediate effect advancing religion, notwithstanding the fact that there were a few odd copies left over and somebody among the public found out about it and requested it and they were given to them, we think stretches the meaning of the primary effect test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.329" offset="6224665">I think at this point I would like to reserve any remaining time for rebuttal, Your Honors.</text>

            <text syncTime="2965.580" offset="12009743">And we ask the Court to take a strong look at this, because symbolically this is extremely important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.829" offset="12026670">I think the Nebraska practice hits square on with the neutrality theme that this Court has always maintained in most of the establishment clause cases, going through Everson and McGowan, Abbington, Walz and Epperson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.089" offset="12087692">All of the establishment clause cases, irrespective of whether they held for the plaintiff or for the defendant, the one rule that this Court has always had is that when it comes to government, when it comes to religion, government must remain strictly neutral, neither endorsing or appearing to endorse one religion over another or religion in favor of non-religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.891" offset="12178912">And it seems to me that the record in this case supports the conclusion that one religion is in fact better than others.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.982" offset="12211303">In the record, for example, there is the testimony of Dr. Palmer, who said... would you agree that by having a uniquely Christian chaplain in the legislature it adds an air of officialdom to the Christian faith?</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.226" offset="12264280">And he says, it could be perceived as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.632" offset="12269922">But the other witnesses also agreed to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.147" offset="12279953">Reverend Stevens, who is a Unitarian minister, testified as an expert on behalf of the Plaintiff, and he said it certainly adds an air of officialdom to one religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.986" offset="12319346">And of course, Senator Chambers said the same thing.</text>
