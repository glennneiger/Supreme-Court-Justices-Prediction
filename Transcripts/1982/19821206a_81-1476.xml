            <label>Mr. George W. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="95.803" offset="530292">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, broadly stated, the controlling issue in these cases is whether the homestead rights of a delinquent taxpayer's spouse preclude enforcement of a federal tax lien against the delinquent taxpayer's interest in the homestead property.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.060" offset="615347">The Internal Revenue Service made substantial tax adjustments... tax assessments against Respondent Rodgers' husband as well as the husband of Respondent Ingram.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.042" offset="655262">This litigation arises from the government's efforts to collect those taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.866" offset="674592">The pertinent facts are undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.975" offset="694968">Respondent Rodgers and her former husband, Philip Bosco, were married in 1937.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.441" offset="716806">In 1955, they purchased the real property involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.953" offset="734883">The property was community property, and Respondent and her husband claimed the property as a homestead under Texas law.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.544" offset="761215">In 1971 and 1972, the Internal Revenue Service made assessments against Philip Bosco in excess of $900,000 for federal wagering taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.776" offset="810220">Bosco died in 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.571" offset="825371">The assessed taxes remain unpaid.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.585" offset="837388">Respondent Rodgers remarried, and she now occupies the property with her new husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.458" offset="868944">The government filed this action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, seeking to reduce its assessments against Bosco to judgment to enforce the liens, the tax liens against any property belonging to Bosco, and to secure a deficiency judgment for any unpaid tax liability or unsatisfied tax liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.807" offset="954312">In the other case, Respondent Ingram and her husband, Donald Ingram, acquired real property during their marriage that they claimed as a homestead.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.413" offset="988689">As in the Rodgers case, the property was community property.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.255" offset="1004049">In 1972 and 1973, the Internal Revenue Service made assessments against Donald Ingram for unpaid taxes withheld from the wages of the employees of a company of which Donald Ingram was the president.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.562" offset="1069355">The unpaid balance of the assessments is about $9,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.449" offset="1088895">In connection with their subsequent divorce, Donald Ingram conveyed his interest in the homestead properties to Respondent Ingram.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.556" offset="1129332">After unsuccessfully attempting to dispose of the properties, Respondent Ingram and the trustee for the properties filed this action against the United States and several other Ingram creditors in state court to quiet title to the property and to remove any liens encumbering the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.048" offset="1203311">The United States removed the action to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, and filed a counterclaim seeking enforcement of its tax liens.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.747" offset="1246047">Donald Ingram was added as a defendant on the government's counterclaim.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.636" offset="1261616">Without explanation, the district court refused to enforce the tax liens in the Rodgers case, but the same court enforced the tax liens in the Ingram case.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.662" offset="1317727">On appeal, the two cases were consolidated for oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.176" offset="1339775">The court of appeals held that because the homestead interest of a spouse is characterized as a property interest under Texas law, the government cannot enforce its tax lien against the homestead property while the delinquent taxpayer's spouse chooses to maintain her homestead interest in the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.980" offset="1422948">Accordingly, the court affirmed the judgment for Respondent Rodgers in pertinent part and reversed the judgment for the government against Respondent Ingram in pertinent part.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.366" offset="1460565">The questions in these cases are matters of statutory interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.533" offset="1489195">The relevant provisions of the Internal Revenue Code are Section 6334, which exempts certain classes of property from the reach... from levy for federal taxes, Section 6321, which creates a lien against all property belonging to a delinquent taxpayer and in favor of the government, Section 7403, which provides for a civil action to enforce a tax lien against any property in which a delinquent taxpayer has any right, title, or interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.100" offset="1623464">Except for the very narrow exemptions set out in Section 6334, all of the delinquent taxpayer's property and rights in property are subject to levy to satisfy federal tax liens, federal tax claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.266" offset="1684173">Homestead property is not mentioned in Section 6334, nor does any other federal statute purport to exempt such property from federal tax claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.509" offset="1725133">State laws exempting property from the claims of private creditors are wholly ineffective against the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.071" offset="1755330">The Internal Revenue Service's regulations are quite explicit on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.832" offset="1774452">No provision of a state law may exempt property or rights to property from levy for the collection of any federal tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.222" offset="1811964">Thus, property exempt from execution under state personal or homestead exemptions... exemption laws is nevertheless subject to levy by the United States for collection of its taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.543" offset="1857208">Under Section 6321, the United States has a lien on all property and rights to property belonging to any person who fails to pay his taxes after appropriate demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.305" offset="1908304">Whether the taxpayer--</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="442.083" offset="1915409">Let me get the government's position straight.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.332" offset="1928366">I don't think any of us question the susceptibility of a homestead to the enforcement of a federal tax lien, but is it the government's position that if the delinquent taxpayer owns any interest in a homestead, any partial interest, that it may proceed to sell the entire homestead?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="george_w_jones" startTime="469.746" stopTime="510.730">
            <label>Mr. George W. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="469.746" offset="2026064">--Our position is that Congress has authorized the Attorney General to file suit against any property in which the delinquent taxpayer has an interest, and our position is that there may be circumstances, not present here, in which it would be appropriate to sell only the delinquent taxpayer's interest, but where that can't be done, the government is entitled to sell the entire property with division of the proceeds as the means of accommodating the interest of any other parties who have interest.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="510.730" offset="2190008">So that here you would, in effect, sell the homestead under Mrs. Rodgers, who continued to occupy it, and who under state law had the right to occupy it for the balance of her lifetime.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.849" offset="2238491">You would in effect evict her and give her her share of the proceeds?</text>

            <text syncTime="540.999" offset="2311112">Suppose your delinquent taxpayer is a person who holds a mortgage on my property, and the government moves in to enforce the lien, the tax lien on the mortgage.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.382" offset="2372656">Does that mean that it can sell my property?</text>

            <text syncTime="559.256" offset="2384150">Well, I am not clear that the mortgagee's interest in your property would be sufficient for the government's tax lien to attach.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="570.627" offset="2429603">Well, it is an interest in property.</text>

            <text syncTime="574.811" offset="2446321">Well, if it is, Congress has said that under Section 7403, the government may proceed against any property in which the taxpayer has an interest or in which the government has a lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.292" offset="2492192">Now, the district director or the Secretary certainly may take into account your interest in the property or any other interest in the property in determining whether to proceed against the property by means of foreclosure under Section 7403 or by administrative levy, but once the district director or the Secretary of the Treasury has made that determination, Congress has provided for enforcement of the tax lien.</text>

            <text syncTime="629.853" offset="2666481">Let me put it another way.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.039" offset="2671184">Suppose that my next door neighbor has an easement over my homestead property, and he is delinquent in taxes.</text>

            <label>Mr. William D. Elliott</label>
            <text syncTime="1922.674" offset="7837786">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in this case, the government takes the awesome position that the property of one may be used to satisfy the tax liability of another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.231" offset="7880000">To this claim, we make two arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.064" offset="7891285">First, there can be no foreclosure of the separate homestead property because in Texas it is indivisible, it is individual to her, and it is indefeasible during her lifetime or until her earlier voluntary relinquishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.776" offset="7966204">Secondly, that the district court's judgment not ordering foreclosure in the Rodgers case should not be disturbed here, because the government has made no claim of abuse of discretion, and hasn't even attempted to overturn that finding on that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.719" offset="8029943">Since the Congress defined the source from which tax liability may be enforced, that is, property and rights to property of the taxpayer, it is clear here that the government is simply attempting to attack and utterly destroy the property of someone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.882" offset="8114579">It is imperative that we examine not only the property and rights to property of the taxpayer here, the deceased husband, but similarly we must examine those property interests of others who would be affected or who own individually property that doesn't belong to the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.862" offset="8190544">In Texas, it has been a venerable policy for over 100 years, Texas constitutional law since 1876, and statutory law for many years before that, that each spouse is entitled to use and possess the homestead for as long as they want to or until their death.</text>

            <text syncTime="2038.179" offset="8299840">It is important to understand the peculiar nature of the Texas homestead law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.631" offset="8317603">In fact, homesteads originated in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.999" offset="8327112">Each spouse can own a community one-half interest in the home, or one spouse may own it all as separate property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.237" offset="8356055">But each spouse is given a separate property right, a homestead right, to use and possess, as that term is defined in the Texas Constitution, for their entire life.</text>

            <text syncTime="3287.344" offset="13296437">Your Honor, specifically, by constitutional amendment, a single person in Texas was given the same homestead right as a married person, and to say that Mrs. Ingram's homestead rights ceased on her divorce is an inaccurate statement with regard to the law in Texas.</text>

            <text syncTime="3375.996" offset="13651076">The... I wanted to point out in relation to questions asked by perhaps Judge Blackmun that we do not feel that the marketability of the property is a problem for the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.608" offset="13721502">The marketability of the interest should be the government's exclusive problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.976" offset="13738952">In this case, at the district court level and at the Fifth Circuit level, the government has taken the position not that they want one-half of the proceeds of the sale.</text>

            <label>Mr. L. Lynn Elliott</label>
            <text syncTime="3458.133" offset="13979592">Thank you, Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.116" offset="13987533">I would like to say to the Court that Mr. Bill Elliott and I have conferred with regard to Justice O'Connor's question regarding the effect of a divorce on community property, and Mr. Bill Elliott agrees with me that a divorce will... could affect a... the homestead right of a party if in effect, as in this case, Donald Ingram gave up his homestead right by conveying it to his spouse, but a divorce as such does not per se affect the homestead rights of either parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.964" offset="14174883">It is something that must agreed to or disposed of at time of the divorce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.768" offset="14198184">Obviously, if one party moves to another place, it would probably be said that that party has abandoned the homestead, in light of the rule that one person may have only one homestead, not two.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.544" offset="14257221">The party remaining in the home would have... the homestead rights would continue with the residency and the possession of that property, unless by some affirmative act they, the party disavows the homestead right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.787" offset="14314272">Again, in this particular case, the author of the opinion in the Fifth Circuit, Judge Jerry Williams, was a University of Texas professor before he was appointed to the bench, and taught real properly, among other courses there, and when he... in his opinion he describes the homestead right as being one that was actually remanded to the district court for determination of whether there was abandonment or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.627" offset="14453557">That was the decision in the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.995" offset="14467037">It may be a question that, why did the district court, the same judge, the Honorable William Mac Taylor, heard both of these cases within a two weeks' period of time, and had a different result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.772" offset="14530148">He granted the government's motion for summary judgment in the one case, and the taxpayers or the non-taxpayer spouse motion in the other case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.764" offset="14586155">It had already been predetermined that the case, both cases would be appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.717" offset="14605904">His attitude was, I've got to be right in one of the cases, so that is why it was done that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.118" offset="14631504">He announced that at the time.</text>

            <text syncTime="3626.476" offset="14653028">And Taylor didn't want to try any more jury cases because he is going to be leaving the bench, and he didn't want to get strung out in a long jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.194" offset="14691899">In this case, the government's position has been, he announced that that was not my opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.549" offset="14725231">That is what he announced at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3646.168" offset="14731709">The government's position is, we are going to sell this property, and we are going to take your interest, Mrs. Ingram, and although you owe no taxes, we are going to take your interest, and we are going to pay your husband's tax bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.480" offset="14809032">That is really what this case bottoms out on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3669.633" offset="14825646">And we don't believe that to be the law in this country, and we do not believe that that is consistent with the Constitution in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.521" offset="14853126">We think the effect of a decision supporting the government's position as it is very narrowly stated would have the effect of abrogating the Texas constitution in its pure language, and the Texas Supreme Court decisions in the Semonet cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3696.184" offset="14931807">Judge Taylor's father sat on the Texas Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3699.886" offset="14946645">That is the case that held the Texas homestead right to be a separate vested right in property, and not subject to being divested except in those manners prescribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3712.777" offset="14998158">And with that, I conclude.</text>
