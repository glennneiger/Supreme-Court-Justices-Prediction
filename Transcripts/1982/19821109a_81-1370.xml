            <text syncTime="7.982" offset="172101">Mr. Davis, I think you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gary W. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="56.276" offset="365303">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and if the Court please:</text>
            <text syncTime="60.992" offset="384111">The central issue in this case is whether or not a Kansas statute known by its framers as the Kansas Natural Gas Price Protection Act, is in violation of the contract clause of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.608" offset="462583">There is no argument in this case that this particular Kansas statute does impair two natural gas purchase and sales contracts between Energy Reserves and Kansas Power and Light Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.414" offset="533845">There is also no question that this impairment occurs from five to six years, and not only does it incur... not only does it prevent Energy Reserves from receiving a substantial portion of the consideration that they would have received, it also prevents it from receiving its contracted right of termination if it could not receive the money that it was supposed to receive under the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.511" offset="650247">Kansas Power and Light Company's answer to this impairment is that it violates... that it is within the reserve police power of the State of Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.241" offset="697163">Underk the decisions of this Court in Home Building and Loan Association v. Blaisdell, United States Trust v. the State of New Jersey, Allied Structural Steel v. Spannaus, this Court set forth certain tests of reasonableness, and also that the statute must be of a character justifying the use of the police power.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.528" offset="798309">The points that I want to make are four, and these are that in the first place, these contracts would not have been entered into without these pricing provisions that have been impaired.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.990" offset="864137">Secondarily, I want to point out that the impairment to ERG, Energy Reserves, is severe.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.768" offset="891200">Thirdly, I'd like to point out that this statute has an extremely narrow focus, is very limited in its application.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.218" offset="921084">And the fourth point that I want to make is that this statute serves no broad societal benefit, and in fact, does not solve any emergency or any supposed emergency that it is supposed to solve.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.228" offset="977091">The facts in this case are that in September of 1975, after months of negotiations, the parties finally agreed to the terms of these two contracts that are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.832" offset="1035501">These are what you call long term natural gas contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.220" offset="1053055">One is for the life of the gas field and the other is for the life of a gas processing plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.046" offset="1076356">They have a duration of 20 to 30 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.013" offset="1088268">The two pricing provisions that are involved, the first one is one that says that in the event that there is a price prescribed for the gas involved that is higher than the price that is being paid under this contract by any governmental authority, then that new price as prescribed by government would be the new price under the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.113" offset="1200594">The second pricing provision that's involved here is what is known as a pricing redetermination provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.750" offset="1227135">It's in the... and what this does, it's every two years, Energy Reserves is entitled to come to KP&amp;L and say that we want our price redetermined.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.619" offset="1274678">We want it redetermined on the basis of what is being paid for other gas in the State of Kansas under like contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.834" offset="1311563">It's a pricing provision that is designed to, during the long term of these contracts, to assure Energy Reserves that it is always receiving a price that is akin to the market price.</text>

            <text syncTime="307.437" offset="1369972">Mr. Davis, may I ask you whether the prices under the contract here had increased under that second clause before the Kansas legislature passed the act here?</text>

            <text syncTime="324.244" offset="1437159">The price increased at the first opportunity in 1977, and it increased from $1.52 a million Btu to $1.77 a million Btu.</text>

          <turn speaker="gary_w_davis" startTime="345.673" stopTime="515.152">
            <label>Mr. Gary W. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="345.673" offset="1522841">It definitely does retroactively apply, and the Supreme Court of Kansas so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.404" offset="1545829">The other provision in the contract that I'd like to call to the Court's attention is what's known as the intent provision; and this intent provision specifically provides that the point of these two price escalation provisions was to provide ERG during the term of the contract the anticipated increase in the natural gas price.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.191" offset="1640914">Now, I want to point out also that these price escalation provisions are not automatically imposed upon KP&amp;L.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.173" offset="1684905">When a price escalation occurs under one of these pricing provisions, then KP&amp;L is obligated to go to the Kansas Corporation Commission and seek its approval to pass through all or a part of any price increase under either one of these provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.041" offset="1752301">And this KP&amp;L did when the first price increase came around.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.429" offset="1777901">KP&amp;L then has the obligation if it can't get it passed through, then KP&amp;L can either say we're going to buy this gas and take it out of our profits, or they can tell Energy Reserves we couldn't get approval to pass it through; therefore, we're not going to pay the increased price.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.810" offset="1871419">And the Energy Reserves is then given an option under the contracts to terminate if it does not receive this increased price.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.463" offset="1898064">What happened was right after the 1977 or within a year after the 1977 redetermination the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.098" offset="1952608">This act authorized and prescribed a higher price for intrastate gas, which is what's involved here, than the price that was then being paid under the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.390" offset="1997747">It was that time on December 1, 1978 that Energy Reserves requested an increased price.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.653" offset="2022825">As I say, the KP&amp;L then applied twice, once in December of '78 and once in February seeking a pass-through.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.009" offset="2064203">Nothing happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.744" offset="2067128">Things were going on in the legislature about what to do about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.461" offset="2086041">And on May 29, 1979, approximately six months after this first price increase would have been due, this particular act was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.879" offset="2131703">And what this particular statute does, it prevents either one of these clauses from ever coming into operation; and it also prevents Energy Reserves from exercising the contract right of determination if it doesn't receive one of these price increases.</text>

            <text syncTime="536.690" offset="2286975">One would be under this government escalation price which would be the Section 105 price under the Natural Gas Policy Act, which is... Congress when they passed the Natural Gas Policy Act created a special category for intrastate gas that was under contract at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.979" offset="2360118">The other price provision that would of course control would be this price redetermination provision which is a market price redetermination.</text>

            <text syncTime="588.309" offset="2493447">This Section 109 price of course is a special category of pricing that was set forth by the Natural Gas Policy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.713" offset="2526988">It is a substantially different price than the Section 105 price which is prescribed for natural gas, and it's a different price than we would receive under competitive conditions.</text>

            <text syncTime="903.166" offset="3752862">In 1978, however, it was approximately 30 cents a million BTU, and it has gone up with inflation.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.116" offset="3792673">On the question of inducement, a member of the Board of Directors and officer of Kansas Power and Light Company testified at length in 1975 that these contracts would not have been entered into except for these escalation provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.108" offset="3868637">He also testified that the price of gas was going to increase everywhere, and he also testified concerning the fairness of these contracts, and that he pointed out that Energy Reserves had an option to sell its gas at that time rather than $1.53 at $2.04.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.053" offset="3944392">The $2.04 price is substantially the same price that existed under the Natural Gas Policy Act in 1978, December 1, 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.627" offset="3986710">In other words, the price that would be afforded to ERG under its contract with this first price increase that's prevented is substantially the same price that KP&amp;L testified ERG could have sold its gas for three years earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.418" offset="4049822">This act is also bad and improper from the standpoint that it is extremely narrow in its focus.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.741" offset="4095171">It covers only six per... something less than six percent of all the gas produced in Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.190" offset="4124950">It covers something less than 10 percent of the gas consumed in Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.268" offset="4145221">It applies only to contracts that have these type of price escalation provisions which you would find in a long-term contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="1103.116" offset="4552627">And so there is no real finding that any benefit goes to any of the people who are supposed to be benefitted by this act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1655.363" offset="6761646">Energy Reserves is receiving exactly and precisely what it contracted for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.940" offset="6783902">It has no right to rely on anything other than the price federal and state law allows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.001" offset="6808144">Therefore, the constitutional inquiry may be ended at this stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.827" offset="6827474">Second, the Price Protection Act serves a legitimate public purpose, and that is the moderation of sudden increases in price for a fuel vital to Kansas agricultural economy and the welfare of its citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.773" offset="6883272">Energy Reserves has admitted that Kansas may constitutionally set maximum prices to protect its consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.566" offset="6918485">The thrust of Energy Reserves' argument seems to be its specious claim that the Price Protection Act is somehow special legislation that benefits the Kansas Power and Light Company and other gas distributors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.295" offset="6977313">The only beneficiaries of this Price Protection Act are the approximately two million consumers of intrastate gas in Kansas who pay, penny for penny, all costs of the gas they consume.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.228" offset="7029140">As to the cost of gas paid to producers, utilities are nothing more than a conduit of dollars from the consumer to the producer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.379" offset="7069682">In fact, for the 12 months ended September 30, 1982, 91 percent of Kansas Power and Light Company's gas department revenues amounted solely to gas costs paid to consumers, to purchasers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.326" offset="7133525">Third, the legitimate public purpose of the Price Protection Act has been achieved on reasonable conditions which have been appropriately tailored to the goal with great deference to producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.931" offset="7183889">The Price Protection Act in fact strikes at 100 percent of the evil perceived by the legislature by imposing prices which have been deemed reasonable by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.222" offset="7233104">Energy Reserves' contracts have not been substantially impaired for two specific reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.641" offset="7266750">It is receiving exactly what it contracted for, no more and no less; and that is a price controlled by both state and federal regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1935.706" offset="7883030">No, there isn't, Your Honor, and in fact, the State Corporation Commission when it adopted the order which requires the immediate and automatic pass-through of all natural gas costs paid to consumers, in Docket Number 106-850 said in April of 1977:</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.914" offset="7971847">"Since energy costs are largely outside the control of the utility, they ultimately must be passed through to the consumer, and an appropriately designed clause is the most efficient method to accomplish this pass-through. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.364" offset="8021688">So the Commission has not taken it upon itself to... to renegotiate the terms of the contracts between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.124" offset="8068709">These very contracts were the subject of an extensive hearing in 1975 before the State Corporation Commission, and the escalator clauses were inquired into extensively in that hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.979" offset="8116147">And the State Corporation Commission authorized the Kansas Power and Light Company to commence purchases of gas under those contracts, including those terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.304" offset="8153345">So today the law of the State of Kansas is those terms are approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.178" offset="8172885">Your Honors, it is our position that the Natural Gas Policy Act and the Price Protection Act are part of the terms of these contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.157" offset="8208830">These contracts were executed in an atmosphere of pervasive regulation of natural gas by federal and state governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.295" offset="8241326">Kansas has regulated all aspects of natural gas for more than 75 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.621" offset="8266612">The parties foresaw state and federal law and regulations and incorporated them into their contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.540" offset="8290332">When a contract incorporates state law, that law by definition is a part of that contract, and the law cannot impair itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.553" offset="8326381">The second specific reason there's been no substantial impairment of these contracts is that Energy Reserves has no right to rely on anything more than Section 105 of the NGPA, and that is a maximum price subject to Kansas' right to limit the operation of the contractual escalator clauses below that maximum price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.104" offset="8428572">The Price Protection Act merely represents Kansas' exercise of that specific right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.944" offset="8459919">Energy Reserves purports to rely on the NGPA for its claim to higher prices, and yet it claims the Price Protection Act impaired its contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.582" offset="8494505">We agree that the contracts are subject to the Natural Gas Policy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.002" offset="8516239">We do not agree, however, that Energy Reserves is subject only to the price limitations of the NGPA it prefers to the exclusion of other, more stringent limitations in that act it does not prefer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.027" offset="8568274">Prior to the NGPA there were no limitations on the operation of these indefinite price escalator clauses in the contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.618" offset="8606622">The sky was the limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.118" offset="8612683">The NGPA placed two specific, separate limitations on the operation of these clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.537" offset="8634312">First, Section 105 provides that in no event may escalator clauses operate to produce a price in excess of the NGPA Section 102 price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.265" offset="8693244">But for this limit, Energy Reserves could today obtain a much higher price for its gas than that Section 102 price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.917" offset="8723860">The second limitation intended by Congress in Section 105 is the specific right of Kansas to prescribe more stringent limitations on the operation of these escalator clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.757" offset="8775164">In response, Kansas, and Oklahoma for that matter, have prescribed modestly more stringent limitations on the operation of these clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.768" offset="8815288">Energy Reserves has, therefore, no right to cheerfully rely on and in fact unconditionally demand one price limitation set by Congress to the exclusion of the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.513" offset="8866279">That maximum price set by Congress was said to be subject to Kansas' further limitation on those escalator clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.072" offset="8904418">Energy Reserves' reliance, therefore, on these contracts in the NGPA may not exceed the price permitted by both conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.428" offset="8945901">Just... they may not, as they would have it, just rely on one condition which would permit it the higher incentive price for its old non-incentive gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.485" offset="8994070">Energy Reserves has no new wells as defined in the NGPA which provides that higher price for new wells.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.450" offset="9025940">This is all old gas wells drilled in the '50s and '60s primarily.</text>

            <label>Mr. Basil W. Kelsey</label>
            <text syncTime="2551.429" offset="10345855">Kansas' right to set natural gas prices is without question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.598" offset="10370619">Natural gas is a vital fuel to Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.269" offset="10381277">Seventy-five percent of the homes are heated with gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.237" offset="10389114">It is the single most important fuel for irrigation pumping and fertilizer production.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.548" offset="10410325">Energy Reserves admits that Kansas may set maximum prices for all natural gas to protect its customers, its consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.435" offset="10441881">This inquiry... this admission should end the constitutional inquiry of public purpose, because the Price Protection Act was intended to and it has the effect of regulating the price to consumers of natural gas produced and consumed in Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.772" offset="10511262">Energy Reserves purports to make, however, an argument that the Price Protection Act somehow benefits the Kansas Power and Light Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.878" offset="10539683">The state legislature's conclusions and orders of the State Corporation Commission, as I have indicated, completely belie that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.718" offset="10575001">As the legislature knew and concluded when it enacted this law, utilities cannot benefit economically by an increased or decreased cost of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.652" offset="10622753">That was the testimony of the chairman of the State Corporation Commission to the legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.805" offset="10643442">And as I've indicated, we are serving... we are buying gas under these contracts pursuant to the Commission's approval of these pricing clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.662" offset="10674789">We are passing through in 1981 $137 million of purchased gas cost to producers without adding one shred of interest on the utility's part.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.515" offset="10726198">Ninety-one percent of our revenues from gas operations are merely purchased gas costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.013" offset="10752216">The legislature, the trial court, and the Kansas Supreme Court all concluded that but for the Price Protection Act, Kansas consumers would pay the higher new gas costs for the old gas they were using.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.820" offset="10811461">The legislature further concluded that absent the Price Protection Act, the burden of increased costs will be passed on to consumers, and that savings to those consumers is ample reason to support the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.517" offset="10866214">The presence of the State Corporation Commission, the Kansas Legal Services representing persons of low income in Kansas in amici briefs to the court confirmed that the $128 million in gas cost reductions wrought by this law will be received only by the two million persons of the... 2,400,000 people in the state.</text>

            <text syncTime="2706.164" offset="10964852">Mr. Kelsey, what justification is there for the Kansas statute to allow increases under these indefinite escalator clauses for old intrastate gas in contracts executed after April 20, 1977 but not for contracts executed before that date?</text>

            <label>Mr. Basil W. Kelsey</label>
            <text syncTime="2729.325" offset="11057430">Two specific answers, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.246" offset="11065163">First, the legislature perceived that for those persons who had intrastate gas to sell and who entered into them after that date, April 20, 1977, when the President announced the national energy plan, the legislature perceived that those persons might have some greater right to rely on a higher price for their gas.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="2751.285" offset="11145306">Based on the President's speech.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="basil_w_kelsey" startTime="2753.347" stopTime="3033.735">
            <label>Mr. Basil W. Kelsey</label>
            <text syncTime="2753.347" offset="11153561">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.910" offset="11155860">On the announcement of that national energy plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.518" offset="11162234">Secondly, if the act covered contracts executed after that date and into the future, producers of intrastate gas in Kansas who had gas to sell could conceivably receive a higher price in the interstate market for that gas, and it would tend to diminish the availability of gas in Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.665" offset="11250841">Your Honors, Energy Reserves has complained that the terms and conditions of this statute are unreasonably narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.786" offset="11291279">Kansas' goal of moderating gas price increases has been achieved on very reasonable conditions, carefully tailored to the goal, with extraordinary deference to these very producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.110" offset="11344568">Of all the gas being consumed in Kansas, only intrastate gas subject to escalator clauses had the potential for sudden increases which concerned the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.745" offset="11387200">The Price Protection Act reaches 100 percent of that gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.432" offset="11401933">Yet, Energy Reserves complains that the Price Protection Act reaches an insufficient volume of gas; Mr. Davis says 10 percent of the gas, intrastate gas consumed in Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.726" offset="11447073">The facts are that 75 percent of all the gas consumed in Kansas is interstate in origin and beyond the reach of the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.410" offset="11477793">Moreover, all that interstate gas is priced, as a result of the NGPA, at or lower than, much lower than in many instances, the maximum price set by Kansas for intrastate gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.513" offset="11538188">Sixty percent of the gas consumed in Kansas which is produced in Kansas is not subject to these escalator clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.759" offset="11567236">Mr. Davis indicated that fixed price escalator clauses could take the price over 102, and therefore the statute was narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.585" offset="11598479">The only contracts before the legislature when it considered this legislation were contracts with fixed price escalator clauses of one or two cents a year, one percent a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.033" offset="11644350">Obviously, when we're talking about kinds of increases permitted here, they could never reach the Section 102 price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.920" offset="11675905">Moreover, the Natural Gas Policy Act itself in Section 105 has the effect of limiting the price for that intrastate gas not subject to escalator clauses in effect freezing the price to what was being received in real terms on the day the act became a law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.226" offset="11757094">So it's only 40 percent of the gas consumed in Kansas that's produced in Kansas which was subject to escalator clauses where the legislature perceived the evil of sudden increases in price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.532" offset="11810279">Therefore, the Kansas legislature regulated that, and it regulated 100 percent of that evil.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.920" offset="11835879">And it did so on very reasonable terms, adopting the pricing scheme of the NGPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.527" offset="11862315">It did so by saying for old non-incentive gas such as the gas under these contracts, we will allow the maximum price if your contracts otherwise call for it... the NGPA 109 price, which happens to be the very same price as the maximum price for old interstate gas as see in Section 104.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.533" offset="11962312">It did so by saying but for your new gas, any wells the surface drilling of which was commenced on and after February 19, 1977, your contract clauses may escalate the price for that new gas on up to that NGPA Section 102 ceiling in order to encourage exploration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.492" offset="12042142">No change.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.477" offset="12050083">It further said and moreover, for low production or stripper well gas, as defined in the NGPA in Section 103, the Price Protection Act will allow Kansas intrastate producers that very same maximum gas if your contract calls for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.829" offset="12115494">As Energy Reserves concedes, Kansas has the constitutional authority to set maximum prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.311" offset="12141408">Therefore, we submit, the Price Protection Act's much less stringent limitations on prices are constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.496" offset="12170142">The legislature was merely deferring to the producers' interest in achieving its goal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.775" offset="12191249">Energy Reserves has in fact described the economic policy of the NGPA as reasonable, but when that policy is applied by the Kansas legislature to its contracts, it complains that the scheme is unconstitutionally narrow and constitutes special legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.377" offset="12261675">The Kansas legislature limited sudden price increases--</text>

            <text syncTime="3109.236" offset="12577130">Natural gas is absolutely essential to the health and welfare of Kansas people, as well as to the principal industry of the state, and that's agriculture.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gary W. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="3142.753" offset="12711190">I just want to make a few points, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.970" offset="12724043">First off, this is the first time I've ever heard this argument that the Section 105 and the Section 102 price is anything different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.687" offset="12758942">Secondarily, there is... until this moment I thought there was no argument that our contracts have been impaired.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.590" offset="12790498">Looking at page 23A of the Appendix to Jursidictional Statement, which is the Supreme Court of Kansas decision, it says,</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.743" offset="12823203">"The statute obviously was intended to and does impair the rights of ERG under the contracts. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.208" offset="12852983">With regard to this applicable laws provision that Mr. Kelsey has talked about, first off, that is a standard provision that you see in almost every contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.218" offset="12909094">Secondarily, I see no way that it can possibly be construed to mean that it means that it's subject to invalid state laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.778" offset="12947337">And furthermore, as just a last point on the intent of the parties under that applicable laws provision, there is the last sentence that says,</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.616" offset="12986625">"In effect, notwithstanding any such applicable laws, such applicable laws shall not prevent Energy Reserves from exercising its right of termination if it did not receive the price increases promised by these two price escalation provisions. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.563" offset="13054439">The other provision, throughout this case KP&amp;L has tried to picture itself as a benevolent institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.576" offset="13086518">In the testimony in which they were justifying these contracts before the Kansas Corporation Commission, their vice president and a member of their Board of Directors testified at length.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.118" offset="13132702">He testified that if KP&amp;L was not entitled to enter into these contracts that they would lose the value of their investment of $3,600,000 because they would lose the value of the gas-gathering facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.628" offset="13190694">To say that they don't have a financial interest is ridiculous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.704" offset="13206994">Secondarily, KP&amp;L doesn't think themselves that they have a right to pass this through.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.325" offset="13233430">When the price increase was triggered in 1978, what'd they do?</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.714" offset="13255060">They applied to the Kansas Corporation Commission for permission to pass it through.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.618" offset="13278674">They did the same thing in February of 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.882" offset="13291736">And they know as well as I do that these price increases are in nowise automatics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.162" offset="13316813">I would simply... I would ask the Court to do one other thing, and that is to look at 55-1408.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.314" offset="13353385">We call it the Section 8 of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.111" offset="13360594">What that cat authorizes the parties to do is to renegotiate the price provisions to any price they want up to the legal ceiling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.794" offset="13399360">Obviously, Energy Reserves wants the price that it contracted to receive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.433" offset="13417959">What that means is that the Kansas legislature has delegated to Kansas Power and Light the power and authority to totally avoid all of the price limitations that are contained in this Kansas act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.348" offset="13481594">They've turned a bilateral contract into a totally unilateral contract.</text>
