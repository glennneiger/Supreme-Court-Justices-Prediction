            <text syncTime="24.584" offset="239305">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="26.770" offset="247978">At issue in this case is the constitutionality of 40 U.S.C. Section 13k which prohibits picketing, leafletting, and demonstrating in the Supreme Court building and on its grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.156" offset="301581">A related statutory section, 13p defines the Supreme Court grounds as extending to the curb of each of the four streets enclosing the block on which the building is located.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.355" offset="346302">The Appellees, Zywicki and Grace, after making several attempts between May of 1978 and March of 1980 to distribute leaflets or demonstrate with a sign on the Supreme Court grounds, and on each occasion being informed by Supreme Court police officers that the conduct was prohibited, brought this action seeking a declaratory judgment that Section 13k's ban is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.455" offset="446717">The District Court dismissed their action, and the Court of Appeals by a two-to-one decision held the statute unconstitutional on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.779" offset="480049">Section 13k is a content-neutral congressional restriction on a place within which one manner of First Amendment activity, demonstrating and leafletting, may occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.258" offset="537937">This Court made it clear in Heffron versus Krishna Consciousness that time, place, or manner restrictions have been upheld providing three criteria are satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.221" offset="585793">They are: first, that it must be content-neutral; second, that it must serve a significant governmental interest; and third, that it leaves open ample alternative channels for communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.216" offset="633754">This statute clearly applies to all demonstrating and leafletting activity without regard to content.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.338" offset="662280">The remaining issues therefore concern the significance of the governmental interests and the adequacy of alternative channels for communication.</text>

            <text syncTime="183.831" offset="876275">But the no-public-forum concept is the notion that there are certain kinds of places where certain kinds of activity are not to be permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.485" offset="910861">And this is not a restriction on all types of First Amendment expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.576" offset="935207">It is a restriction on one type of expression; namely, picketing, leafletting and demonstrating within an identified place, the same as you had in Heffron and in Greer versus Spock and in Grayned versus City of Rockford.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.711" offset="995811">So that what is brought into place so long as it is content-neutral is the consideration of the comparative interest of the government on the one hand in identifying a certain limited place in which one manner of restriction is to be upheld, and also the alternative means of communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.172" offset="1073656">With regard to the congressional objective, the Court of Appeals acknowledged that the government does have a substantial interest in restricting picketing and other forms of expression in or near courthouses, but concluded that these legitimate concerns are fully addressed by another statute, 18 U.S.C. Section 1507, which prohibits picketing or parading in or near any federal courthouse with the intent of influencing a judge, juror, witness, or court officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.676" offset="1199671">The Court of Appeals reasoning that Section 13k is outside Congress' constitutional authority because its purposes are adequately accomplished by another statute is flawed in several respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.888" offset="1244497">The first is that it is a non sequitur.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.170" offset="1249617">I know of no authority, and the Court of Appeals certainly suggested none, to support the proposition that the Constitution prohibits Congress from enacting two separate statutes that address the same problem in overlapping ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.273" offset="1306041">Indeed, that proposition is squarely rejected by this Court's holding in O'Brien, United States versus O'Brien, that the existence of a statute prohibiting non-possession of a draft card did not interdict an overlapping statute prohibiting mutilation.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.485" offset="1374900">Second, the Court of Appeals premise is in fact incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.435" offset="1394649">It is true that Section 1507 overlaps one of Section 13k's purposes; namely, attempts to influence the courts' decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.417" offset="1426622">But Section 13k also reaches another congressional objective that is not covered by Section 1507 but is equally legitimate; that is, protection against the appearance of impropriety, against the inference that the processes of the Nation's highest Court are or may be influenced by demonstrators or leafletters.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.752" offset="1511886">Section 13k stands as a congressional assurance to the people of this Nation--</text>

            <text syncTime="423.486" offset="1834864">Significant in that respect, Justice Marshall, in our view, is the distinction between the holding in Cox and that in Edwards versus South Carolina.</text>

            <text syncTime="436.855" offset="1888363">They involved remarkably similar demonstration-type activities, one of which was held constitutionally protected and the other not.</text>

            <text syncTime="596.666" offset="2527631">And your point, of course, illustrates just how narrow really is the disagreement between the government and our opponents, because everyone agrees, I take it... the Court of Appeals, the Appellees, and the Amicus... that Congress could properly prohibit any kind of leafletting or other activity within the building itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.812" offset="2624180">So that the only spatial issue that we're talking about in the protection of this kind of interest is whether you can extend it, whether Congress can extend it, from the edge of the building to the edge of the curb.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.433" offset="2670678">Now, it could, of course, be extended across the street, which would make it... and in my opinion, that would also be constitutional... but those kinds of lines are the kinds of lines that are traditionally drawn by legislatures and they reflect the kind of policy kind of judgment that we have traditionally entrusted to the legislatures.</text>

            <text syncTime="788.744" offset="3295945">At the end of the day it is a judicial judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.806" offset="3304200">But as this Court said initially in Grayned versus City of Rockford, the question is whether the particular type of expression is compatible with the purpose of the particular place in which it occurs at a particular time.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.363" offset="3370342">The inquiry then is whether the expression activity is or is not compatible with the purpose of the particular place.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.204" offset="3397718">Now, how and by whom is this issue of compatibility to be resolved?</text>
            <text syncTime="819.904" offset="3420497">At the end of the day it is a judicial decision because it is an issue on which the constitutional holding turns.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.682" offset="3451635">But it is, I think, significant in this respect, that the restriction in the Cox case, in Grayned, and in Greer, all represented specific particularized determinations by the authorized policy makers concerning that issue of compatibility, concerning the compatibility of demonstrations with the particular purposes for which a particular place was intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.564" offset="3547138">The statute in Cox, for example, dealt specifically with picketing near a courthouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.779" offset="3564066">That was the legislative determination that was involved in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.388" offset="3578485">The anti-noise ordinance in Grayned prohibited disruptive noise on the school ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.777" offset="3596040">And the regulation in Greer pertained to one particular military reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.853" offset="3616311">Now, compare that with Edwards versus South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.352" offset="3626342">The law allegedly violated in Edwards versus South Carolina was a breach of the peace statute which contained no legislative judgment concerning whether demonstrations were compatible with the grounds surrounding a legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.330" offset="3694260">Now, that is not to say that the legislative determination is conclusive, because it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.343" offset="3714322">But neither is it irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.467" offset="3726756">As this Court observed in Grayned, a precise statute gives this Court the assurance that the legislature has focused on the First Amendment interests and has determined that other governmental policies compel regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.633" offset="3779419">The reason was best explained, perhaps, by Professor Kalven, that in the difficult balancing processes that these cases force upon the Court, it has the benefit of a council of a deliberate, specific, and relevant legislative judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.971" offset="3836784">The legislative judgment underlying Section 13k is likewise deliberate, specific, and relevant, and it is that picketing, demonstrating, and leafletting on the Supreme Court grounds are incompatible with the use to which that particular area should be put; specifically, the prevention of the public perception of impropriety in the judicial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.618" offset="3919436">Let me say just a word about the adequacy of alternative channels for communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.725" offset="3947857">The impact of this statute on the Appellees' legitimate First Amendment interests is really quite minimal.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.425" offset="3982652">In Greer versus Spock the Court upheld a ban on partisan political speeches and demonstrations within a military reservation, observing that the people at Fort Dix could attend political rallies out of uniform and off base.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.137" offset="4041480">There were other means for the expression of that particular kind of political communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.370" offset="4066453">And similarly, the Heffron opinion stressed alternative means and places for the practice of Sancratan, which was the religious objective in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.289" offset="4098113">These alternatives did not represent the demonstrators' first choices, but in each of those cases the place restriction was upheld and in each the disparity between the demonstrators' first choice and the alternative was, if anything, greater than in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.844" offset="4172301">All that Section 13k requires is that the demonstrators move not off the... off base and out of uniform, many miles away, but 20 feet farther away, clearly a lesser spatial sacrifice than was involved either in Greer or Heffron.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.866" offset="4260386">And this illustrates--</text>

            <label>Mr. Sebastian K.D. Graber</label>
            <text syncTime="1182.307" offset="4870188">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.133" offset="4881473">The issue in this case is whether pristine First Amendment activity may be absolutely forbidden anywhere on the grounds of this Court despite the fact that such expression is not basically incompatible with the normal uses of the sidewalk that surrounds the Court, and despite the fact that the manner of expression in which my clients were engaged... that is, dissemination of printed matter... is allowed on the sidewalks surrounding the Court, which is to say that the Washington Post is allowed to disseminate its particular views through its newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.352" offset="5038312">And we submit that the statute at issue is totally unnecessary to preserve the integrity of this Court and that Congress has specifically addressed the concerns of the appearance of justice when it promulgated 1507 and made a specific and considered legislative judgment which is reflected in the legislative history of 1507, that upon a balancing of interests certain speech could be prohibited; namely, speech which is directed toward influencing the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.182" offset="5181672">And we submit, as the Court of Appeals found, that 1507 amply protects the appearance of justice interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.474" offset="5218871">Moreover, we would point out that Section 13k was not passed by Congress, at least as reflected in the legislative history, based on the assumption that some protection was needed beyond that provided by 1507.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.498" offset="5286893">In fact, 13k was enacted prior to promulgation and enactment of 1507.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.433" offset="5318658">Both statutes were considered by the same Congress, the 81st Congress, in 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.682" offset="5339661">However, examination of the legislative histories, which we detail in our briefs, reveals that 13k was really a housekeeping measure that in 1949 for some reason the legal counsel to the District of Columbia determined it no longer possessed authority to commission special officers to police this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.110" offset="5429418">At that time, the marshal of this Court went into conference with the Court and consulted apparently with legislative counsel to the House of Representatives, and the legislative scheme which was modeled after the scheme applying to the Capitol was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.806" offset="5496187">And 13k virtually identically tracks the language of the Capitol statute, 193g, which was invalidated as being spatially unconstitutional in the Jeannette Rankin case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.285" offset="5550103">Now, Mr. Lee has pointed out that the test articulated by this Court in Grayned should be applied to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.077" offset="5601199">And we agree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.296" offset="5606110">And that test is whether the manner of expression is basically incompatible with the basic and normal use of the area in which the expression takes place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.166" offset="5653548">And we respectfully submit that a lone leafletter or a lone sign holder who is expressing their views on this Court in a peacable, silent, and orderly manner is not doing something that is basically incompatible with the normal use of the sidewalk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.581" offset="5719272">Now, the government would have the Court hold that the grounds of the Court are more akin to a military base as in Greer, or a prison as in Adderly, than the public sidewalk that it actually is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.513" offset="5783011">As the Court I am sure is aware, there is a bus stop outside and tourists come to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.058" offset="5813209">The sidewalk is basically like any other sidewalk save for the fact that it borders this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2757.480" offset="11170818">And those two messages are that where you have a statute that is attacked as being either overbroad or vague, that the first thing you look for is to see if there isn't some way that a common-sense narrowing interpretation of the statute can't save its constitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.987" offset="11248872">That is particularly appropriate in this instance, because unlike the statute in Broderick and in New York, this is a congressional statute, and therefore the interpretative stewardship lies within this Court itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="2886.538" offset="11687102">Certainly, it's not binding, but neither is it... is it totally irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.771" offset="11708000">And the marshal has interpreted this statute as prohibiting generally picketing-type activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.424" offset="11734645">And the picketing-type activity certainly does include the carrying of a sign.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.126" offset="11753453">The second message that comes out of this Court's holding in New York versus Ferber is that because you can find one isolated element of unconstitutionality, that you don't throw out the... the entire statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.743" offset="11827850">Therefore, both the construction alternative and also the on-its-face approach as opposed to the... or excuse me, the as-applied approach as opposed to the on-its-face approach are two messages that come clearly from this Court's decision of last year in New York versus Ferber.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.595" offset="11899321">Now, finally, as to whether this really is just a place restriction, Mr. Graber expresses the view that it totally forbids expressive activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.826" offset="11940281">And that clearly is his view.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.637" offset="11947491">That is the way that he would interpret the statute, because of his example including everything from the Washington Post to the Pepsi Cola truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.008" offset="11985003">The point of the matter is that is not the purpose of the statute, it is not the way the marshal has interpreted it, and this Court's opinions clearly teach that you don't interpret the statute in such a way that is to be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.892" offset="12052503">The purpose of interpretation is to save rather than to condemn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.062" offset="12073192">As a statute that prohibits picketing-type activities, demonstration kinds of activities, it is a statute that falls squarely within the ambit of what this Court has held in Greer versus Spock, Heffron, and the other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.806" offset="12136200">It forbids only one kind of expressive activity; namely, the picket sign, the leafletting, the parading.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.147" offset="12169532">Just as the Court said, one of the basics for the Court's holding in Greer versus Spock was that the kind of political activity that was involved in that case might create, and I am quoting,</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.656" offset="12223553">"the appearance that the military was acting as a handmaiden for partisan political causes or candidates. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.467" offset="12242779">If the preservation of military appearances justifies a place limitation on demonstrations, then we submit that a fortiori a congressional judgment affecting a much smaller place in the interest of preserving public confidence in the judiciary should also be upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.788" offset="12316131">And now, finally, aside from all other considerations, it should lie within the legitimate authority of Congress to identify a limited number of places which serve as symbols of certain congressionally determined national values.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.951" offset="12400768">And where necessary to the achievement of those symbolic purposes, Congress may further determine that those few places are to enjoy a special environment free of the picketer and free of his signs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.243" offset="12453849">And if Congress wants to take special steps to prevent the grounds of this Court from becoming another Hyde Park or even a Lafayette Park, in symbolism of the dignity and decorum and total judicial values that are represented by this Court, not only as representative of its own work but also the work of the entire federal judiciary, then that, we submit, lies within the legitimate prerogative of Congress so long as it is content-neutral, and this one clearly is, and so long as there are adequate alternative channels for communication, and clearly there are.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.665" offset="12595537">For this reason, the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be reversed.</text>
