            <label>Mr. Robert H. Chanin</label>
            <text syncTime="100.569" offset="546548">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="103.411" offset="557938">This case arises in a public school district in Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.126" offset="576850">Indiana has enacted a statute governing the labor relations of its public school teachers.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.898" offset="599943">Like the National Labor Relations Act and the public sector labor relations statutes in other states, it adopts the principle of exclusive recognition.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.217" offset="641216">Under that principle, the union selected by the majority of teachers in an appropriate bargaining unit is authorized and indeed obligated to represent all teachers in that unit, whether they are members of the union or not, in dealing with the school district.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.584" offset="714672">In 1977 an election was held in the Perry Township school district to select an exclusive representative for the teachers.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.876" offset="751871">The competing organizations in that election were the Appellant, PEA, and the Appellee, PLEA.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.654" offset="786979">During the election campaign itself, both organizations were treated equally and they were accorded the same opportunity to sell their programs, their activities, and their ideas to the voting teachers.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.211" offset="845180">The teachers voted and chose PEA as the exclusive representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.912" offset="867959">PEA subsequently entered into a collective bargaining agreement with the school district.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.003" offset="892305">Among other things, the agreement gave PEA access to the individual teacher mailboxes, which are name slots which appear in each school building, and to the inter-school mail system, which is a courier service by means of which the district delivers material from school building to school building.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.244" offset="985301">The collective bargaining agreement expressly stated that these rights are given to PEA... and this is the quote from the agreement...</text>
            <text syncTime="219.599" offset="1022708">"acting as the representative of the teachers. "</text>
            <text syncTime="223.425" offset="1037964">And that article went on to deny to other employee organizations, including PLEA, access to those school mail facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.076" offset="1084671">The PLEA and two of its members challenged this access restriction as violative of the first Amendment and the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.853" offset="1131691">The district court granted summary judgment for Defendants, but the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.617" offset="1162829">The Court of Appeals held that it is unconstitutional for a school district to distinguish between the exclusive collective bargaining representative and rival unions in granting access to internal communication facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.141" offset="1232837">This holding, which would invalidate the prevailing practice in public sector labor law throughout this country, is inconsistent in several respects, we believe, with the principles announced by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.523" offset="1290411">Its overriding defect, however, is its failure to recognize the distinction that this Court has drawn between public and non-public forums in determining the constitutionality of access restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.065" offset="1356553">It is appropriate to begin analysis by setting forth the two standards that this Court has adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.937" offset="1388109">If the property in question constitutes a public forum, the government's right to restrict access is subject to rather stringent limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.262" offset="1433353">Generally speaking, it only may impose reasonable time, place and manner restrictions which are content-neutral and narrowly drawn to meet a compelling governmental interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.253" offset="1489360">A different standard applies if the property is not a public forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.783" offset="1511407">Although we are not suggesting in any sense that government is free to act without restraint, the test is a less stringent one.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.012" offset="1548396">The access restriction is constitutional if it is reasonable on the one hand, and is not designed to prohibit access because the government disapproves of a speaker's view or seeks to favor one point of view over another.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.428" offset="1617987">It is within this framework that we believe the issue before the Court can be best analyzed, and we believe that issue can be divided into two subsidiary questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.549" offset="1670545">The first is, which of the two standards is appropriately applied to the school mail facilities?</text>
            <text syncTime="390.140" offset="1704922">Once that is determined, the second question is whether the challenged access policy meets the appropriate standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.135" offset="1744837">Although the court below found that the school mail facilities are a nonpublic forum, it did not judge the constitutionality of the access policy by the standard that this Court has held applies to such forums.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.347" offset="1813696">It applied instead the public forum standard and concluded that the policy failed to pass constitutional muster under that standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.608" offset="1854760">It is our belief that the latter conclusion is wrong in its own right and that the access policy here in question is sustainable even under the more stringent standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.665" offset="1910976">But there is no occasion to reach that question in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.552" offset="1926545">We submit that the dispositive flaw in the decision of the court below is its failure to use the proper standard to judge the constitutionality of this access policy to this nonpublic forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.406" offset="1993941">The Appellees appear to concede this.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.811" offset="2007525">They make no attempt to defend the analysis or approach taken by the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.479" offset="2034274">To the contrary, they acknowledge the importance of the distinction between the standards governing access to public and nonpublic forums, and devote much of their argument to an effort to demonstrate that the school mail facilities are a public forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.097" offset="2112746">We submit this effort fails.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.423" offset="2126016">Under the relevant legal principles set forth by this Court, most recently last term in United States Postal Service v. Council of Greenburgh Civic Association, it is clear that the school mail facilities involved in this case are a nonpublic forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.839" offset="2203652">It is well established that certain government property is by its very nature a public forum: streets, parks, highways, and certain analogous facilities which historically have been used for purposes of public assembly and debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.627" offset="2286826">These, I think the reference would be traditional public forums.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.517" offset="2306365">Although it may sometimes be difficult to determine whether a particular facility is sufficiently analogous to a park or a street to be classed as a traditional public forum, again this question is of no concern here.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.803" offset="2375538">No one is suggesting that the school mail facilities are in any sense like the parks, like the streets, or like the highways.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.677" offset="2415035">It is conceded that they are not a traditional public forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.063" offset="2436560">But that of course is not the end of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.564" offset="2450561">Government may by its actions convert what otherwise would be a non-public forum into a public forum, and Appellees contend that that is what has happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.183" offset="2501030">It is their position as we understand it that the school mail facilities have been converted into a public forum to which they have a constitutional right of access, and because of the existence of that right the access policy before the Court must be judged by the more stringent standard applicable to public forums.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.219" offset="2605206">The test to be used in determining whether such a conversion has taken place was also set forth in the Greenburgh case.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.433" offset="2646062">If the facilities have been preserved for the use to which they are lawfully dedicated or preserved for their normal and intended function, the property remains a nonpublic forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.675" offset="2706979">If on the other hand the facilities have been opened up for more general use, they may become a public forum for certain groups or for certain purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.484" offset="2762254">To apply this test here, the threshold question is to identify the uses for which the school mail facilities are lawfully dedicated.</text>

            <text syncTime="667.384" offset="2813872">Speaking of threshold questions, counsel, at some point I hope you're going to address the jurisdiction question.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.398" offset="2837905">But you do it in your own time.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert H. Chanin</label>
            <text syncTime="675.038" offset="2844488">Mr. Chief Justice, it was not my intention to address it in oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.319" offset="2861624">We believe that the point is clear and we have addressed it rather completely in our reply brief, and unless there are questions we're prepared to rely on the reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.500" offset="2906346">Phrased otherwise, the question we must look at it, what is the normal and intended function of these school mail facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.169" offset="2957023">The Appellees point out that they are basically a communication medium and what they seek to do is communicate, and therefore they are within the normal and intended function.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.005" offset="3012298">We submit that is far too broad a formulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.769" offset="3031420">The function must be more narrowly defined if it is to have any meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.518" offset="3054408">The normal and intended function of a school mail facility is not to carry information by anyone, about any subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.436" offset="3098085">The normal and intended function, as both of the lower courts recognized, and indeed as Appellees concede in their briefs, is to communicate to the teachers information that involves school business.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.444" offset="3162137">That is the normal and intended function.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.912" offset="3171959">So we must look in this case as to what does the phrase "school business" mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.189" offset="3201111">And in the context that we have before us, it derives meaning from two sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.188" offset="3229115">The first is the inherent function of any school district to educate children.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.699" offset="3259103">This function would embrace any communications that the school district reasonably concludes are supportive of that mission, that are of relevance and educational interest to the students.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.038" offset="3324514">But there is in this case a second source from which the phrase "school business" derives meaning, and that is the Indiana labor relations statute, more specifically the representational duty that that statute imposes upon the union that is designated as the exclusive representative and which requires it to have an effective method for communicating with the members of the bargaining unit that it is both authorized and obligated to represent.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.411" offset="3473934">The Appellees admit, as does the court below, that PEA has legal obligations vis a vis the members of the bargaining unit that it does not have.</text>

            <text syncTime="1538.543" offset="6298503">Their case for conversion to a public forum is based on three other alleged uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.527" offset="6326401">They contend first that PEA has unfettered use, that it has not been limited to access solely to perform its representational function.</text>

            <text syncTime="1572.625" offset="6434862">The record is totally silent in the face of that statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.046" offset="6452520">If there were any evidence to indicate that PEA was granted or has used the school mail facilities for any other purpose, it would be Appellees' burden to produce that evidence, and they have failed to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.771" offset="6511348">The Appellees next assert that numerous non-school-connected organizations have been allowed to use the school mail facilities, and their quote is,</text>

            <text syncTime="1627.136" offset="6652827">It's important to emphasize what is involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.258" offset="6669337">Although this case arises in an educational setting, it does not involve academic freedom, textbooks, students' rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.675" offset="6707058">It is a labor relations case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.065" offset="6716566">The Plaintiffs are a labor union and two of its members, and they seek to use the school mail facilities to promote their organization and to increase its membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.091" offset="6764631">The Appellees' papers are filled with references to the marketplace of ideas and monopolistic control of access media.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.791" offset="6799531">They conclude their motion to dismiss by stating that if this decision, this policy, is struck down PEA will be forced to compete in the marketplace of ideas solely on the strength of their ideas and program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.723" offset="6859195">We did compete in the marketplace of ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.533" offset="6874450">We competed during the representation election, and with equal access we sold our ideas and our programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.139" offset="6908827">And that's why we have access and they don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.357" offset="6921784">Now, if they want to challenge us again we'll compete again, equally and without preference, in the marketplace of ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.808" offset="6951564">And if they beat us, they'll have access.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.009" offset="6964311">But to suggest, as they do, that this competition must go on continuously, and even more, that the school board has to make its facilities available to force that competition, is not only unreasonable but it is the very antithesis of labor peace and stability.</text>

            <text syncTime="1744.273" offset="7121360">This case raises the question of the constitutionality of a collective bargaining agreement between a teachers union and a school district which grants the teachers union exclusive access to the school's internal mail system and compels the school district to deny that right to another teacher organization, while at the same time the school district is permitted and in fact does allow numerous other organizations and individuals to use that system for whatever purpose they deem appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.678" offset="7286976">The Metropolitan School District of Perry Township consists of 13 schools, and in each school there is a set of mailboxes which has a teacher's name written above them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.483" offset="7342251">This internal mail system and the mailboxes which are part of it has been in place for a number of years, and for a number of years outside groups, individual teachers, the Perry Education Association, and the Appellee here, Perry Local Educators' Association were granted simultaneous and equal access to those facilities.</text>

            <text syncTime="1851.228" offset="7549245">They state that the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held an Indiana statute in essence to be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.771" offset="7595430">In point of fact, what the Court of Appeals held was a paragraph in a collective bargaining agreement between the school district and Perry Education Association violated the Perry Local Educators' Association's rights under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.512" offset="7674320">Indiana law does not treat that contract as either an ordinance or a statute.</text>
