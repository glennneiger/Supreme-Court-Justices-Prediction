            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="144492">We will hear arguments first this morning in Verlinden against Central Bank of Nigeria.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.369" offset="185870">Mr. Chayes, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Abram Chayes</label>
            <text syncTime="16.164" offset="209067">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="21.880" offset="231950">The question in this case may appear at first glance to be a technical and abstract one, but it touches directly and deeply the power of the national government to regulate and protect the foreign relations of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.559" offset="298719">Congress in 1976, acting in the exercise of its powers over foreign affairs and foreign commerce, enacted the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act which was comprehensive legislation establishing circumstances and conditions in which suit may be brought in the courts of this country against foreign sovereigns and the procedures regulating such suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.141" offset="413031">The question here is whether as an aspect of this legislation Congress can, within the meaning of Article III of the Constitution, ensure that all such suits against foreign sovereigns may be brought in the federal courts, the courts of the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.369" offset="501952">The court below, the Second Circuit, held that there was an impenetrable constitutional barrier to this congressional choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.255" offset="541449">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="100.581" offset="546778">The plaintiff here, petitioner in this Court, is Verlinden B. V., a Dutch corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.032" offset="584603">Thus, the suit is between a foreign corporation and a foreign sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.326" offset="609785">The diversity clauses of Article III do not cover such a suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.512" offset="630474">They cover suits between a citizen of the United States and a foreign sovereign, but not between an alien and a foreign sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.883" offset="667986">So recourse must be had to the arising underclause of Article III which grants jurisdiction in a constitutional sense to the federal judiciary over suits arising under the laws of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.671" offset="735173">But Judge Kaufmann below held that this case does not arise under the laws of the United States, and so he dismissed on the constitutional grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.466" offset="782298">It is our contention here and the main proposition in this case that the case does indeed arise under a law of the United States, and that law is the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.332" offset="841752">Jurisdiction in this--</text>

            <label>Mr. Abram Chayes</label>
            <text syncTime="183.082" offset="876756">No, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.314" offset="881668">Jurisdiction in this case is founded on the special jurisdictional section of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act that codified in 28 USC 1330; and that provides for original jurisdiction in the federal courts without regard to a mounting controversy of any nonjury civil action against a foreign state with respect to which the foreign state is not entitled to immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.287" offset="989605">So in order for jurisdiction to attach, the foreign state defendant must be one... must be not entitled to immunity with respect to the claim asserted.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="223.158" stopTime="236.341">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="223.158" offset="1037044">Mr. Chayes, is the absence of sovereign immunity as defined in the act an element of the plaintiff's cause of action, or is it an affirmative defense, in your view?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="abram_chayes" startTime="236.341" stopTime="372.427">
            <label>Mr. Abram Chayes</label>
            <text syncTime="236.341" offset="1089811">We believe it is an element of the plaintiff's case, because it is a jurisdictional requirement under 1330 that sovereign immunity must be absent the federal rules, and in the absence of the federal rules, general pleading principles require that the plaintiff plead and prove subject matter jurisdiction in order to establish his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.785" offset="1175597">We did so in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.097" offset="1184792">The situation is such that the defendant cannot waive or concede subject matter jurisdiction, because as we know and as happened in this case, the absence of subject matter jurisdiction can be raised by the court sua sponte or by any party at any time during the course of the case; and that's what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.632" offset="1274967">So... and the act provides, indeed, that in case of a default the court must determine that... on the evidence that the plaintiff is entitled to recover, which means that he must determine that there is no immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.221" offset="1333272">And the cases in the lower courts in which there have been defaults have followed that practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.969" offset="1356365">So that within the narrowest notion of the arising underclause, as Your Honor suggested, the federal question of the sovereign immunity of the defendant is a central element of plaintiff's claim... of plaintiff's case in every instance arising under the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.833" offset="1443823">But I should say that the act is much more than a jurisdictional statute or a mere authorization to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.736" offset="1487395">The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act represents a major departure in U.S. policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.406" offset="1522085">Until the act was passed, the ability of a private party to sue a foreign state was totally a matter of the discretion of the executive branch of the national government.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.774" offset="1579555">No case against a foreign state could be brought in a state or federal court where the executive branch suggested immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.268" offset="1629501">Now, up until--</text>

            <label>Mr. Abram Chayes</label>
            <text syncTime="374.268" offset="1641517">--Well, that was because of the opinions of this Court.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="378.206" offset="1657295">So it was a... Do you think it was grounded in the Constitution?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="abram_chayes" startTime="385.311" stopTime="452.721">
            <label>Mr. Abram Chayes</label>
            <text syncTime="385.311" offset="1685716">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.185" offset="1689165">The doctrine dates, of course, from the Schooner Exchange, one of Chief Justice Marshall's great opinions, in which, alluding to the fact, which has been a dominant theme in sovereign immunity jurisprudence, that every case against a foreign sovereign touches the dignity of the foreign sovereign, and involves the foreign relations of the country, Justice Marshall established the principle in the Schooner Exchange that foreign sovereigns were absolutely immune.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.796" offset="1819672">That is, no case of any kind could be brought against a foreign sovereign in the courts of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.077" offset="1848721">In cases that arose from time to time, for example, when a case was initiated by the attachment of a commercial vessel owned by the foreign sovereign, the sovereign might appeal to the Department of State to suggest immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.943" offset="1932208">That is to suggest to the Court that this was a case in which immunity was appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.485" offset="1950389">When the State Department--</text>

            <text syncTime="452.721" offset="1955300">Mr. Chayes, before the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, there would have been no jurisdictional basis for a federal court to entertain this particular suit, would there?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="abram_chayes" startTime="460.451" stopTime="599.397">
            <label>Mr. Abram Chayes</label>
            <text syncTime="460.451" offset="1986229">--It is not clear, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.779" offset="2003574">That is, until 1952, there were no in personam jurisdiction against a foreign sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.149" offset="2033041">The cases were begun by attachment of a foreign sovereign's property, but I think you are correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.053" offset="2064701">It is what... the question that the Chief Justice asked earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.288" offset="2081628">Until the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act was enacted, it does not appear that there was jurisdiction for a suit by an alien versus a foreign sovereign, although I can't say for sure that no such cases were brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.515" offset="2142546">In 1952, as you know, again, as a matter of executive policy, the United States government adopted the restrictive view of foreign sovereign immunity, and the State Department indicated that it would not suggest immunity in cases growing out of the commercial acts of foreign sovereigns.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.550" offset="2234601">But that was an act of grace on the part of the Department of State.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.800" offset="2251633">The Department of State was not bound by that, and in fact in some cases involving commercial acts the State Department did suggest immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.937" offset="2288205">The jurisprudence of this Court tells us that the Court, this Court, the state courts, and the federal courts were bound by the executive... by the executive suggestion and could not disregard it, and in the absence of a suggestion, the Republic of Mexico versus Hoffman tells us that the Court had to follow the policies enunciated by the State Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.038" offset="2388619">But as I said, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act has changed all of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.423" offset="2410144">In the first instance, it judicializes the whole field of foreign sovereign immunity, and remits the question of sovereign immunity to judicial determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.935" offset="2456224">Second, it codifies the restrictive theory of immunity, and subjects foreign sovereigns to suit in cases arising out of commercial transactions, ordinary torts, and that sort of thing, directly parallel, both in concept and language, to the Tucker Act and the Federal Tort Claims Act, by which the United States has consented to sue against itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="599.397" offset="2542010">Would you say, Mr. Chayes, that this dichotomy that was developed in 1952 is somewhat analogous to the old concept of proprietary and governmental functions?</text>

            <text syncTime="611.689" offset="2591225">Exactly so, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.218" offset="2605331">In fact, we used to talk about it in Latin and call it use imperii and use guesti, but it was the same general kind of distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.980" offset="2640335">That is, now the Act doesn't quite take the old line.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.258" offset="2657472">It says, when the foreign sovereign makes a contract, it doesn't matter whether it is a contract for guns for the army or for wheat for the starving poor, that is contract, and the government ought to respond according to the laws of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.315" offset="2721733">It doesn't matter what the ultimate purpose of the contract is.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.609" offset="2738869">Or if the ambassador's car strikes a person, the government ought to be liable, even though that was the ambassador carrying out political functions of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.386" offset="2785994">But it's the same general conception, Your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="670.180" offset="2825178">You could not enforce if there were no assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.051" offset="2844613">Of course, the situation until the enactment of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act in 1976 was, you could never get attachment against foreign assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.781" offset="2883588">One of the major departures of the Act was to provide for enforcement of the judgment by attachment of the assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.874" offset="2919950">The Act also defined the causes of action which would lie against the foreign sovereign and the extent of liability, so that we see here an extended, comprehensive legislative pattern, legislative structure dealing with the entire range of actions against a foreign sovereign expressly made binding on both state and federal courts as a pre-emptive exercise of federal supreme legislative power.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.639" offset="3059026">Now, there is no doubt that this case falls within the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.562" offset="3074699">It arises... it is a suit on a contract, a contract for the purchase of cement.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.869" offset="3095911">The defendant was... The Central Bank of Nigeria is a foreign sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.508" offset="3118481">It repudiated the letter of credit that financed the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.087" offset="3132796">The whole thing was a commercial transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.087" offset="3144812">The court below in identical cases involving U.S. corporate plaintiffs held that the contacts with the United States were sufficient to bring this transaction within the purview of Section 1605(a)(2) of the Act dealing with commercial claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.138" offset="3240943">And second, the Act applies as a matter of interpretation to suits... statutory interpretation, to suits against an alien... excuse me, suits brought by an alien against a foreign sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.287" offset="3293605">The statute says that.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.945" offset="3300188">It says any civil action.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.770" offset="3307503">Both courts below agreed that the statute extends to suits brought by an alien plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.237" offset="3329341">The government's brief, which represents the views of the Justice Department and the State Department, the two executive departments that were the draftsmen of the Act, agrees that the statute extends to suits by an alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.844" offset="3379810">It is the only way that Congress could have fulfilled its twin purposes, which were to provide judicial protection for American business enterprise in the courts in suits against a foreign sovereign, and at the same time to concentrate that litigation in the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.629" offset="3470925">And finally, I think it makes... it is important to note at this point that there is no problem here of opening the floodgates to a whole series of suits with which the United States has no connection, no interest, no concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.905" offset="3528081">That would be inappropriate for determination by the federal courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="860.088" offset="3584819">Yes, indeed, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.866" offset="3591924">The court... the Act permits suit in the state court, but subject to a power of removal by the foreign defendant, so any suit begun in a state court may be removed by the foreign defendant at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.722" offset="3651379">It is not subject to the usual time limit on removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.655" offset="3663081">The fact of the matter is, of course, that most actions that have been begun in state courts have in fact been removed, and the Congress in the legislative history stated that the purpose of the removal jurisdiction was to provide for concentration of the suits... of the litigation in the federal courts, for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.461" offset="3742285">First, to ensure uniformity of decision, and second, to ensure that the delicacy and sensitivity of the question of suits against a foreign sovereign would be recognized in the courts of the nation, the nation being the one that bears international responsibility for the acts of the judicial department.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.531" offset="3830579">So, there is no doubt that that was the purpose of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.621" offset="3850954">I do want to say that... what I started, that there is no problem here of a flood of litigation that would be inappropriate for determination in the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.916" offset="3892123">Congress established a different set of thresholds and limits than the party plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.178" offset="3925142">It required in 1605(a) and 1605, 6, and 7, the statutes withdrawing... the sections withdrawing immunity, it required that for immunity to be withdrawn, the transaction in suit had to have substantial connection with the United States, as was the case here, where the transaction was financed through the Morgan Bank in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.352" offset="4037886">So, the alien will not be able to bring suit unless the transaction has substantial connection with the United States, and once that is so, it seems to me hard to argue that suits against a foreign sovereign are not most appropriate for determination in the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.531" offset="4138614">That goes all the way back to Alexander Hamilton, who in the 81st Federalist said that since the nation will be responsible for the judgment of its courts in suits touching foreign citizens and foreign affairs, the nation... the courts of the nation should have jurisdiction to hear them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.097" offset="4240805">We maintain that the statute as so construed is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.502" offset="4262435">It is constitutional for the reason I gave in the answer to Justice O'Connor's question that the plaintiff's case contains a necessary federal element, the absence of immunity, and it is constitutional under the teaching of the Osborn case, which says that where Congress has legislated on a matter within its competence, here the foreign relations of the United States, and has legislated comprehensively, it may grant jurisdiction to cases arising within that... within the ambit of that legislative program, even though the particular case may not be governed on the merits by federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.034" offset="4432544">So, for those two reasons, it seems to me the jurisprudence of this Court makes it clear that the statute as construed is constitutional, and this cases arises under the Constitution and laws of the United States within the meaning of Article III.</text>

            <text syncTime="1113.045" offset="4596593">It is no different than the Federal Tort Claims Act, in which... which this Court has said cases under the Federal Tort Claims Act arise under the Constitution and the laws of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="1223.971" offset="5040361">The single most critical proposition relevant to this case is one that oddly enough nobody disputes at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.575" offset="5078709">That proposition is that it is for Congress to decide, as a matter of federal law, whether and on what conditions a foreign country should be amenable to suit in an American court, whether by a plaintiff or an American... a foreigner or an American citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.960" offset="5156241">Nobody argues that this question is reserved to the states or is governed by state law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1402.366" offset="5753922">That is, it seems to me that this question could be divided into two parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.460" offset="5770327">The first... and the concern in this case might be thought of in two stages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.146" offset="5793001">The first is under what circumstances should an American court have jurisdiction to adjudicate, and that is the question that is subject to Congress's regulatory power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.920" offset="5844097">Now, if that question is answered in the affirmative, that the transaction between the foreigner and the foreign government is sufficiently American to make it legitimate to authorize an American court to adjudicate it, then the question is whether the Constitution requires Congress nevertheless to leave the matter to a state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.489" offset="5930405">Now, on that point, the diplomatic and foreign relations interest of the United States comes into play, because in this Court's jurisprudence and in the legislative history of this statute, the one thing that was clear was the judgment that a uniform, sensitive national resolution of the question of the amenability of a foreign government to sue in the courts of this country needed a federal national solution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1502.762" offset="6155476">I think that this is a clear arising under case, and no, the Court does not need to go into fancy problems of protective jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.571" offset="6190690">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.573" offset="6194765">In this case, Congress has exercised its undoubted Article I regulatory authority to create a regulatory scheme, which is the... the scheme governing the amenability of foreign governments to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.020" offset="6256518">Now, if there is one thing clear about the arising under clause, it is that if Congress has an Article I power to create a regulatory scheme, it has a matching Article III power under the arising under clause to call on federal trial courts to apply and interpret and enforce that scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.104" offset="6348887">That is, the surprising conclusion of the court of appeals in this case was that although Congress has power as a matter of federal law to regulate the question of amenability, the Constitution requires it to leave the enforcement of its regulatory scheme to a state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.910" offset="6428090">Now, it is that proposition that turns the Osborn case on its head.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.545" offset="6450660">In this case, the Court does not need to worry about some of the more far-reaching conclusions of Chief Justice Marshall in Osborn, just as it doesn't, I think, really need to worry about protective jurisdiction, because this case is within the core of the arising under clause as interpreted in Osborn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.288" offset="6529550">In this case, Congress has enacted a comprehensive statute which governs this important and sensitive diplomatic issue, and now it says the enforcement of that question and the decision of issues under this statute should be in the hands of the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.138" offset="6624949">Under the opinion of the court of appeals in this case, we are in this really anomalous situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.057" offset="6656714">That judgment says that this plaintiff must now sue Nigeria in a state court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1712.286" offset="6993589">Congress permitted plaintiffs to choose a state court, but Congress very plainly said that in any case where the plaintiff chooses a state court, the defendant foreign government has an automatic right to take it to federal court, and Congress in its reports made it very clear why it wished that removal power to exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.983" offset="7080420">The report of the Senate and the House says, in view of the potential sensitivity of actions against foreign states and the importance of developing a uniform body of law in this area, it is important to give foreign states clear authority to remove to a federal forum actions brought against it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1814.419" offset="7402144">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this is a suit on a letter of credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.633" offset="7430983">The only federal question or issue in this case is whether the respondent, a foreign sovereign, is immune.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.082" offset="7464734">That issue can be decided by a state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.146" offset="7481034">The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act applies to courts of the United States or of the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.470" offset="7510291">A state court can apply the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act in determining immunity just as it applies the U.S. Constitution in determining the due process limitations on personal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.151" offset="7569014">The case of Texas Trading v.... Texas Trading and Milling Corporation v. Federal Republic of Nigeria, to which Mr. Chayes referred, illustrates this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.428" offset="7614154">In that case, the Court found that Nigeria's activity in purchasing cement amounted to a commercial activity outside of the United States under the FSIA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.468" offset="7666294">It found that harm to United States companies that were not paid on their letters of credit constituted a direct effect in the United States under the FSIA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.230" offset="7721361">The Court then turned to an analysis of the contacts with the forum necessary to sustain personal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.930" offset="7756156">The Court there found that Nigeria's extensive use of the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, through which it had advised the letters of credit, constituted a purposeful availing itself of the privilege of conducting activities in the United States under the rule of Hanson v. Denckla and International Shoe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.325" offset="7845703">Now, the fact that the court of appeals cited Hanson v. Denckla and International Shoe and interpreted those decisions did not make this case one that arises under the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.459" offset="7914249">By the same token, the fact that the court applied the FSIA in determining whether or not there was commercial activity and a direct effect does not make this case one that arises under the laws or a law of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.751" offset="7987496">The case clearly does not meet the well pleaded complaint rule set forth in the landmark case of Louisville and Nashville Railroad v. Mottley.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.888" offset="8023963">This Court should construe the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act to provide jurisdiction only when the plaintiff is a citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.694" offset="8067222">This is the same thing that this Court did in 1800 when it was considering the Judiciary Act providing jurisdiction when an alien was a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.986" offset="8112361">The Court there in Mossman v. Higginson held that the other party had to be a citizen, and the rule of strict construction set forth in Romero versus International Terminal Operating Company would support this Court in interpreting the statute to require that the plaintiff be a citizen where there is not a federal question, where there is not a case arising under.</text>

            <text syncTime="2025.675" offset="8247153">I mean, it... I take it it would have liked to construe the statute that way, but it felt it just couldn't.</text>

            <text syncTime="2032.299" offset="8273589">I am arguing in support of the judgment below, and this is an additional ground which I believe is available to support the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.981" offset="8304414">The court below did agree with the analysis that Mr. Chayes and Mr. Bator had put on the case, which is that the Congress intended the statute to apply when an alien was a plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.164" offset="8353106">However, that analysis is not supported by the legislative history of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.522" offset="8382572">The legislative history shows that what the statute was designed to do was to adopt a restricted standard of immunity and to have those standards determined judicially rather than politically by the executive department.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.028" offset="8452580">It does not show a purpose to expand the jurisdiction of federal courts beyond the diversity and federal question jurisdiction scope that they previously had.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.898" offset="8508064">The Congress did contemplate that there would be FSIA cases in federal courts, of course, and normally there will be litigation in the federal courts, because normally the plaintiff will be a citizen of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.485" offset="8578386">The Texas Trading case again illustrates that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.702" offset="8591238">There were four companies there, all of whom were citizens of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.717" offset="8619346">When the plaintiff is not a citizen, and when the claim at issue is not federal, Article III forecloses federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.664" offset="8679114">All that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act does in those circumstances is to provide authority to pursue the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.360" offset="8721850">It is much like the statute which allowed a suit at law but not a summary attachment to collect the Puerto Rican tax in Puerto Rico v. Russell and Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.591" offset="8774827">It is like the Act of Congress limiting the immunity of national banks from state taxation in Gully v. First National Bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.351" offset="8813801">The provision of authority to pursue the claim does not constitute the creation of the case arising under the laws of the United States.</text>

            <label>Mr. Abram Chayes</label>
            <text syncTime="3473.087" offset="14036828">Mr. Chief Justice... Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.948" offset="14040276">First, as to your question whether this case could have been brought before 1976, the answer is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.008" offset="14064518">What happened in 1976 was that the Congress exercised its Article I legislative power, and by doing so created as an essential aspect, as an essential part of the plaintiff's case here the issue of sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.295" offset="14129615">As Justice Marshall suggested, that was pleaded in our complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.137" offset="14144975">At 8A in the record, the Jurisdictional paragraph refers to Section 1330, and if you look at Paragraphs 7 to 15... to 12 of the record and then throughout the record, you will see allegations of connections with the United States designed to show that the claim is a proprietary... based on a proprietary rather than a governmental action, and that it falls within 1605(a)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.441" offset="14266183">That this is an essential part of the plaintiff's case is proved by the Mine versus Guinea case, the very case that provided the basis of the amicus suggestion of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.825" offset="14319787">That case has been dismissed below by the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.434" offset="14338177">Although it raised the same issue that was here, the court of appeals never reached that issue, because it found, examining the issue of immunity, that Guinea was immune in that case, and therefore there was no subject matter jurisdiction, and it dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.238" offset="14401393">It did that not as a matter of defense on the merits, but as a threshold question at the outset of the case, just as we contend and as Justice O'Connor suggested in her question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.015" offset="14448518">Now, I would like to leave with the Court the following point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.732" offset="14463356">These cases will not go away if the Court sustains the court of appeals' opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.653" offset="14491045">These cases will not just disappear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.009" offset="14500450">They go to the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.024" offset="14508495">We can imagine a case in which Olympian York Company owns... a Canadian company owns real estate in the city of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.115" offset="14540887">An embassy in the U.N. rents real estate from the company, and doesn't pay its rent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.891" offset="14572025">The company has to sue it if the... Judge Kaufman's opinion is right in the housing court of the city of New York.</text>
