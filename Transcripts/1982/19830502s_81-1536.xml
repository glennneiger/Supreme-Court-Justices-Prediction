            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="10.937" offset="135971">This case also comes to us from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.512" offset="162302">The case does not readily lend itself to announcement from the bench that suffice as I think to say that it is an income tax case concerning Section 752(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 in partnership interests and a nonrecourse mortgage loan.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.638" offset="242759">And it also focuses on a 1947 decision by this Court called Crane against Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.422" offset="269927">The United States Tax Court upheld deficiencies asserted by the Commissioner against the respondents and the Fifth Circuit reversed expressly disagreeing with an earlier Third Circuit decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.353" offset="321649">We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.904" offset="335860">In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we reverse the judgment of the Fifth Circuit for we find the Commissioner's interpretation of the facts to be consistent with the Crane case and is implementing the statutory mandate in a reasonable manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.618" offset="398763">Justice O'Connor while joining the opinion has filed a separate concurring opinion.</text>
