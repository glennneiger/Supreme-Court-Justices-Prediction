            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="153364">We will hear arguments next in Bill Johnson's Restaurants against National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.465" offset="179173">Mr. Katz, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lawrence_allen_katz" startTime="47.246" stopTime="235.168">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence Allen Katz</label>
            <text syncTime="47.246" offset="342282">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the issue before the Court in this case is the extent to which restraints should be placed upon the power of the National Labor Relations Board to interfere with civil proceedings instituted in state court and growing out of a labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.332" offset="414588">The civil litigation in this case was a suit filed in the Arizona Superior Court by petitioner, Bill Johnson's Restaurants, against several persons who were demonstrating in front of the restaurant in September, 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.137" offset="469864">The suit alleged that the protesters had defamed the restaurant by publishing leaflets which accused the restaurant in engaging in a refusal to pay lawful overtime, in sexually harassing waitresses, in discharging a waitress for union activity, and maintaining filthy restrooms.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.163" offset="545932">The suit also asked for injunctive relief and for damages for misconduct occurring during the demonstrations.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.067" offset="569547">This Court has held in the past that some controversies arising out of labor disputes are so deeply rooted in matters of local concern and responsibility that the state courts have primary jurisdiction to hear and determine these controversies even though they may touch on matters of federal concern as well, and I refer here to suits growing out of labor controversies involving defamation, involving violence, involving trespass and other torts out of such labor disputes where the public peace and order are threatened.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.628" offset="707787">In these cases, the state has been held to have an overriding interest in the resolution of the controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.143" offset="729834">Despite this history, the National Labor Relations Board has in the present case ordered the restaurant to withdraw its civil suit and to compensate the defendants for all expenses incurred by them in the defense of the suit, including expenses incurred by them in the prosecution of their counterclaims.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.714" offset="800156">The Board does not justify its order in this case by any finding that the complaint filed by the restaurant on its face asked for relief barred by the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.599" offset="839757">The Board does not justify its order in this case by any finding that the complaint filed by the restaurant was pre-empted by the National Labor Relations Act, or that it raised issues that were already pending before the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.922" offset="888972">Instead, the Board attempts to justify its intrusion into the parties' civil litigation by a finding that the restaurant's suit constituted an effort to retaliate against those demonstrators who were outside its premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.074" offset="941635">To reach that result, the Board performed adjudicatory responsibilities that should have been performed by the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.617" offset="971728">After the restaurant filed its suit, the Board compelled the restaurant to demonstrate that the suit had some reasonable factual basis, that it had merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.473" offset="1003180">Considerable evidence was presented before the Board's Administrative Law Judge on the same questions that were then pending in front of the state trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.189" offset="1038079">For example, were the offensive statements of the demonstrators true or false?</text>
            <text syncTime="225.783" offset="1056469">Did the demonstrators publish those statements knowing them to be true or false?</text>
            <text syncTime="230.731" offset="1076218">Did the demonstrators improperly obstruct or interfere with the restaurant's operations?</text>

            <text syncTime="346.203" offset="1538167">--Justice O'Connor, I would say that the responsibility of the National Labor Relations Board in that circumstance would be to wait until the state court had issued its determination on the merits of the lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.790" offset="1580486">At that point, if the state court had failed to issue sufficient relief to protect the federal rights that were then at issue, or to protect the rights of employees under the National Labor Relations Act, the Board certainly had the opportunity to take another look at the unfair labor practice charge that was in front of it and to determine whether the interests of the National Labor Relations Act required supplemental relief to be ordered.</text>

            <text syncTime="388.762" offset="1708381">If I understand your question, Justice O'Connor, Section 10(j) of the Act would allow the National Labor Relations Board to file a petition with the United States District Court in order to protect the interests of the Act and the interests of employees against any direct infringement that might occur during the prosecution of that suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.363" offset="1790719">For example, if the plaintiff in such a state suit engaged in discovery which the Board determined might have an adverse impact on a proceeding then pending before the Board, it is arguable that the Board could apply under Section 10(j) to the United States District Court and obtain an appropriately limited injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.962" offset="1869191">In this case, the Board might well have been able to do that, but instead--</text>

            <text syncTime="436.913" offset="1900956">That would be an exception to the Anti-Injunction Act, and this Court has recognized two or three exceptions to the Anti-Injunction Act in the past, and I think one of them would be applicable in this case, and that is, when the Board has to act in aid of its own jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.581" offset="1955604">If there is an issue pending before the Board which has also been raised before the state court, or if the proceedings in the state court threaten to impact directly on the proceedings before the National Labor Relations Board, that, I believe, is what Congress intended Section 10(j) of the National Labor Relations Act to be used for, and the Board could go into the District Court and petition for appropriate limited injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.058" offset="2045570">In this case, the Board did not seek an appropriate limited injunction from the District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="554.414" offset="2370951">I think that if the civil suit on its face were to allege a cause of action barred by the National Labor Relations Act, then the Administrative Law Judge arguably would have authority to take action and perhaps that might include even the restraint of that suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.842" offset="2452662">I think, for example, of the 1970 Machinists case and the 1972 Textile Workers case, in which unions had allegedly violated the Act by seeking to impose fines on employees who had engaged in conduct that was against the union constitution, but the conduct had been engaged in after the employees had resigned from the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.881" offset="2544822">Such a complaint may well state a cause of action barred by the National Labor Relations Act, and in those cases the Board held an unfair labor practice had occurred, and the Board enjoined the state court action to enforce the fines.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.140" offset="2605844">That, of course, is not our case, because the state court complaint filed in this case did not allege a cause of action barred by the National Labor Relations Act or pre-empted by the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
