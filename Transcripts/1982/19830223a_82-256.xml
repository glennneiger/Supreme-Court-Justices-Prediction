            <label>Mr. Louis J. Caruso</label>
            <text syncTime="51.525" offset="352900">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.367" offset="364289">This case involves the validity of a warrantless search of the Respondent and the auto passenger part of the automobile under his control and possession prior to his arrest for possession of marijuana and of the automobile trunk after his arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.233" offset="447777">The two deputy sheriffs were driving south on a country road in a rural area at midnight and the car that the sheriffs were driving was passed by another automobile going in the opposite direction and was clocked by a radar device at 71 miles an hour in a 55 mile hour zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.724" offset="533667">The car was pursued by the two deputy sheriffs with pursuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.176" offset="555506">In about five or ten minutes they lost sight of the vehicle for approximately five or ten minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.063" offset="579016">They did notice the tail lights go left off of the road that they were on and as they made the turn left to follow the car they found the car in the ditch.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.123" offset="623319">The front end of the car was in the ditch.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.745" offset="629798">The rear end was sticking out over the portion of the traveled road.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.603" offset="649233">The entire incident lasted about five minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.948" offset="666578">There was no other traffic that was noticed in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.631" offset="685282">The police car approached the car in the ditch on the passenger side and they saw Respondent seated in the driver's side of the automobile behind the wheel and was the only occupant.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.986" offset="738781">Respondent exited the automobile, leaving the driver's side door wide open with the dome light on, and met the two police officers at the rear of the automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.855" offset="798235">At that time one of the deputies asked Respondent for his driver's license.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.603" offset="821223">The deputy did not... The Respondent did not respond.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.645" offset="841390">He didn't say a word, he stared, and he was asked a second time by the deputy to produce his driver's license.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.097" offset="871169">After a few seconds he reached in his wallet on his person and produced a driver's license.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.798" offset="893948">Secondly, the deputy sheriff asked Respondent for the certificate of registration and this is required to be produced on demand under the Michigan Vehicle Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.325" offset="940133">Again, there was no response and a few moments of staring and the second time he was asked for the registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.337" offset="968136">At that time Respondent made a move toward the open door on the driver's side of the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.834" offset="1002095">He... One of the deputies was behind Respondent and the other deputy was at his side.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.611" offset="1029262">At the time they approached the door, the deputy saw a knife, a large, folded knife in plain view on the floorboard on the driver's side next to the door that was open and in front of the front seat of the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.137" offset="1095300">Upon seeing that knife, the deputy sheriff, one of the deputies, said, hold it, and he was then moved toward the rear of the car at the side window and with his hands on the roof of the car he was patted down by one of the deputies.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.021" offset="1174921">The other deputy at that point in time looked into the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.110" offset="1195192">He did not enter it.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.831" offset="1198118">He took his flashlight and he flashed in the interior of the car and as he did that he noticed the armrest... The front seat is divided by an armrest, divided in half.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.122" offset="1247333">He noticed something protruding from underneath the armrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.151" offset="1259349">At that point in time, he knelt in and again examined it more closely and he flipped up one side of the armrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.006" offset="1290800">As he flipped up the one side of the armrest, he noticed that this was a pouch of a sort that was open.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.834" offset="1318177">He did not touch it.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.878" offset="1326327">He flashed a light on the object and on more close examination he noticed that there was a plastic baggie sticking out of the pouch and out of the plastic baggie in full view, without touching it, he noticed a substance that appeared to him to be marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.651" offset="1405426">At that point in time, he picked up the pouch.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.336" offset="1420159">He felt it with his hands and he felt another hard object in that pouch.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.930" offset="1438549">He opened it up and he noticed that the bottle had a powdery substance and there was a pill of some sort that was wrapped up in tinfoil.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.021" offset="1470836">At that point in time, the deputy sheriff says, I am arresting you for grass, for possession of marijuana.</text>

            <text syncTime="387.669" offset="1697475">--Well, they would have to go through a process to make a determination as to whether the party is intoxicated and then go from that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.118" offset="1727254">But, at this particular point in time, they didn't know really what they had.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.727" offset="1753690">They noticed a car in the ditch.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.615" offset="1761213">They had an unresponsive individual who appeared to be under the influence of something and they wanted to determine whether the registration to the vehicle was in the car or on his person as required by the Motor Vehicle Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.952" offset="1830595">At the time they patted him down, at the time that the saw the large knife, they picked up and they found the pouch and this sort of thing, they charged him and they arrested him and then they asked for the key, because of the deputies who looked inside had noticed that the car was in the lock position, the driving mechanism, and there wasn't any key in the ignition.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.925" offset="1946474">He did give one key and then he said at that time, the Respondent, that he did not have a key to the trunk.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.062" offset="1974999">So, the deputy walked around back of the trunk and he noticed when he looked at the lock of the trunk the lock had been punched out, there wasn't any lock there.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.341" offset="2008123">He was able to open up the trunk by simply inserting a small penknife that triggered the mechanism and opened up the trunk.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.320" offset="2036126">And, when he looked in the truck, he found two large sacks and they were split open, it was a large sack split open into two sections which appeared to him to contain again marijuana, later found out to be about 70 to 75 pounds of contraband marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.536" offset="2096939">At that time they patted him down a second time, they handcuffed him and took him back to the cruiser and called in a wrecker to have the car towed into the Sheriff's Department to secure the vehicle and to bring the Respondent to jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.338" offset="2192129">Now, it is our position, the State's position here, that the frisk of Respondent and the interior of the automobile under these circumstances is justified by the rationale of Terry v. Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.238" offset="2243747">Although Terry allowed an encroachment on the privacy rights of an individual for the protection of police officers, the frisk in Terry was for weapons that was... and was confined to the pat down of the individual's outer clothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.903" offset="2306441">Here, the search for weapons was not limited to the frisk of Respondent but extended into the passenger part of the automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.384" offset="2348342">And, as stated in Adams v. Williams, the whole purpose of the Terry search is not to discover evidence of crime but rather to allow a police officer to conduct an investigation without fear of personal injury.</text>

            <text syncTime="574.374" offset="2444263">There is some indication that Michigan imposes a higher standard for illegal search and seizure cases than the Federal Constitution would require.</text>

            <text syncTime="659.981" offset="2786676">So, in this particular case, it was not decided on the basis of that clause in the Michigan Constitution which permits a greater latitude in the search for evidence in connection with narcotics or from an automobile.</text>

Thomas and also based upon the Belton case, a search incident to arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.687" offset="3829589">In this case, we relied on it, as indicated by the question presented in the brief, upon the rationale of Opperman.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.557" offset="3857070">But, any one of those cases would apply to the trunk search today.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.099" offset="3875146">There isn't any question about it in my opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.225" offset="3883715">But, here, confining my remarks for the moment to the search of the interior of the car after the knife was found, is based upon the Terry rationale, if you please.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.002" offset="3930839">The Terry rationale had to do with an investigatory, a legitimate investigatory search, and the police officer in this case had found himself in a legitimate, confrontive, investigative search for speeding and for a car in the ditch.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.745" offset="3997817">And, the Petitioner suggests, considering the totality of the facts, that it was at night time, in a rural area, an unresponsive individual who would not respond, who made a move toward the open door of the car and found... And there was a knife in plain view.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.422" offset="4088515">I think that all of these factors gave rise to an articulable suspicion that would justify a fear and a concern in these two police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.216" offset="4139610">Both of these officers had considerable experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.090" offset="4151104">One of them had had eight years service as a deputy sheriff and three years in the Police Department for the City of Detroit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.053" offset="4191019">The other had had some experience and training in the Justice Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.690" offset="4217559">And both of these people have testified... It is very clear from the record that they were concerned at all times during the course of the so-called, on-going investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.080" offset="4255071">And, as I submit, the patting down of Respondent and then taking that search from Respondent into the car under these facts and circumstances is part and parcel of a continuous investigation in one incident.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.465" offset="4316616">In addition to that, the reason the police officer indicated that he wanted to go into the car to examine the interior of the car, he had not yet received the certificate of registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.661" offset="4373458">He was going to allow the Respondent to go into the car... he testified to that... to get that registration of the automobile even after he had found the knife and secured the knife.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.969" offset="4422673">He went back in there to see if there were any further weapons so that Respondent could go back into the car to see if he could produce that certificate of registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.763" offset="4457886">But, of course, at that point in time, they lifted the armrest, they found the marijuana and the arrest was made on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.618" offset="4485262">And, the area that was searched was an area that has to do with which there is no great expectation of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.487" offset="4532701">It is under the armrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.067" offset="4539075">It is an area that could conceal a weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.629" offset="4549315">And, as I say, the officers were bent on a very limited intrusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.279" offset="4571884">They were looking... The officer was looking only for weapons because he intended to let Respondent back into the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.043" offset="4602918">Now, insofar as the case law on this is concerned, in Pennsylvania v. Mimms this Court gave recognition to the great danger that surrounds an investigative stop by a police officer to the extent that he is permitted to order the driver out of the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.552" offset="4680972">And, if a person orders... If a police officer orders a driver out of the car, it is for safety purposes and, of course, if nothing is wrong, then he goes back into the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.422" offset="4720469">But, if there are Terry factors that come into being as in this case, the finding of the knife and under these totality of circumstances, then, of course, a search of the interior of the car before letting him back in is justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.120" offset="4779297">It is justified under the reasoning of Pennsylvania v. Mimms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.353" offset="4800195">It is justified under the reasoning of the Terry case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.147" offset="4815346">And, the alternative would have been, as suggested by Justice O'Connor, we could have made... The officer could have made a custodial arrest, but they don't do these things unless they absolutely have to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.563" offset="4873024">But, at this point in time, when they observed the person, they were still in the investigative process that was on-going to try to determine just what they had here, a speedster, an unresponsive person, and here you have a car in the ditch.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.493" offset="4936763">Now, the search after arrest, it can be justified under Opperman, because there certainly isn't any pretext involved in this case because the inventory search was made at the scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.912" offset="4986395">It was made at the scene after the arrest had been made and certainly it would be justified in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.906" offset="5018369">Unlike Opperman, the car was taken in because of the multiple traffic... parking tickets that the party had had.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.481" offset="5044701">In this particular case, an arrest had been made on the scene and on the spot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.699" offset="5069569">And, in addition to that, as I say, I believe that the case is also governed by these more recent decisions, particularly Michigan v. Thomas.</text>

            <text syncTime="1848.208" offset="7539604">In fact... in sort of a limited search, a weapon search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.553" offset="7552978">In fact, it seems fairly clear that an inspection for weapons on the inside of a car whereas the Court has held the expectation of privacy is less and many parts of which are visible from the outside by any passerby is a good deal less intrusive than having an officer actually lay his hands on the suspect's body as the Court described in Terry.</text>

            <text syncTime="1873.964" offset="7642630">Well, it may be less intrusive in a personal sense, but you may be able to get more objects and make a more thorough search.</text>

            <label>Mr. David A. Strauss</label>
            <text syncTime="1884.321" offset="7684113">I think the principle, the leading principle is exactly the same, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.787" offset="7697906">You can look for obtainable weapons and nothing more, but, of course, nothing less if the officer's safety is to be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.973" offset="7730715">I think the other difficulty with the approach of the Michigan Supreme Court and of Respondent, in addition to increasing the uncertainty and danger faced by law enforcement officers, is that it would have the effect of imposing much greater burdens on suspects and of impairing values related to the 4th Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.105" offset="7803231">That is because if an officer concerned about his safety is unsure of his authority to conduct this sort of car frisk, a limited search for weapons, he will be forced to take other highly intrusive actions such as handcuffing a suspect or locking him in the police car through the duration of the stop or possibly even holding him at gunpoint during the stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.112" offset="7895287">And, surely, most suspects will consider these to be far more humiliating and unsettling actions than a limited weapons inspection of a car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.873" offset="7934262">But, if Respondent prevails, a prudent officer concerned about both his own safety and the dictates of the 4th Amendment, will have no alternative to taking these actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.478" offset="7980655">Similarly, and Justice O'Connor alluded to this point earlier, an officer with probable cause to arrest the suspect often will merely stop him and ask him questions to see if there is some exculpatory explanation, but if the consequence... And that way he can avoid an unnecessary arrest, but if the consequence of stopping a suspect instead of arresting him, is that there is some question about the officer's ability to protect his own safety, then, of course, the officer simply will not hesitate to make an arrest and conduct a complete search, an undoubtedly more intrusive search, incident to arrest that Belton gives him the right to conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="2397.812" offset="9738069">Getting to the question of whether or not the so-called protective search of the car violated the Federal Constitution, I think that the Michigan Supreme Court has recently shown that it recognizes the difference between the cases that are cited in the dissent in the Michigan Supreme Court and this sort of a case where there was no articulable facts to which the officers could point to demonstrate danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.006" offset="9830856">Chief Justice Coleman, in her dissent, listed a great many decisions from other jurisdictions and where searches of automobiles were upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.706" offset="9857605">I have suggested in our brief that those cases were distinguishable on the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.218" offset="9871711">Two days before Christmas the Michigan Supreme Court decided People v. Esters and upheld a warrantless search of an automobile and facts very similar to many of the cases cited by Justice Coleman in her dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.759" offset="9921866">In People v. Esters, a dry-cleaning establishment was held up and a young boy who saw the crime take place wrote down the license number of the car that was involved and gave a description of the car and a description of the robber.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.115" offset="9975261">Within minutes the police had located the car, found it in a driveway, the license matched the description that was given.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.330" offset="10004100">There were wet tire tracks coming from the road into the driveway and there were wet footprints from the car into the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.672" offset="10025520">They went into the house, arrested the defendant, who matched the description given by the witness, went out into the driveway and searched the car and found a pistol that matched the description of the pistol that was used in the robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.699" offset="10069615">And, of the six Justices of the Michigan Supreme Court who decided that case, five wrote on the question of whether or not the search was lawful and five said that it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.258" offset="10107858">And, I think that People v. Esters is like Minnesota v. Gilchrist and Uptegraft v. Alaska and U.S. v. Powless and all the other cases cited by Justice Coleman in her dissent, cases where the police officers had some specific reason to believe that the defendant was dangerous as in Uptegraft v. Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.061" offset="10191032">It was almost identical on its facts to People v. Esters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.810" offset="10202004">In Powless, the police had received radio information describing a van that was alleged to have been occupied by armed men and one of them had an outstanding arrest warrant on him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.136" offset="10235336">He was headed toward an Indian Reservation where there had been some shootings within a few days.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.915" offset="10250487">Some of the other cases I have mentioned in the brief are quite similar, Massachusetts v. Almeida.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.130" offset="10275355">They are all cases in which the police had some reason to believe that a violent crime either had been just committed or was about to be committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.239" offset="10303777">And, you contrast that case with this one, where the police officers never testified that they regarded Mr. Long as dangerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.705" offset="10329586">You won't find the word "dangerous" in any of the transcripts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.485" offset="10340766">They never said they feared for their safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.295" offset="10347976">The most that either of the deputies was willing to say is they were not unconcerned about Mr. Long.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.418" offset="10368456">Well, one deputy said, "I didn't completely ignore him".</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.056" offset="10382980">That was the extent of his concern about Mr. Long.</text>
