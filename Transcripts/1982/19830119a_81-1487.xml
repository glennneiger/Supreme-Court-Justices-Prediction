            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="142439">We'll hear arguments next in Bank America Corporation against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.478" offset="176294">I think you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. William Simon</label>
            <text syncTime="63.063" offset="394677">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="65.692" offset="405126">The issue here is whether Section 8 of the 1914 Clayton Act, which bars corporate director interlocks between two or more corporations other than banks, applies to one bank and one non-bank; namely, one bank and an insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.558" offset="504601">The appellants here are four insurance companies, three banks, three bank holding companies, and three individuals who were directors at the same time of both a bank and an insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.900" offset="565936">Both the District and the Circuit Courts found that 40 percent of all insurance directors in America were also directors of banks, and that this situation had prevailed for a long time, and yet until the filing of this case, 61 years after the enactment of the statute, the government had never attacked the bank-insurance interlock.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.789" offset="689548">Indeed, the amicus brief of the American Council of Life Insurance states that 79 percent of their insurance company members have one or more bank directors on their board.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.881" offset="749943">This case was tried in the District Court in San Fransicso before Chief Judge Peckham on a fully stipulated record.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.606" offset="792783">He found that the statute did not apply to an insurance-bank interlock.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.426" offset="820055">On an appeal to the Ninth Circuit in an opinion by Chief Judge Browning, joined in by Senior District Judge Christianson, the Court found that the statute did bar the interlock but Circuit Judge Kennedy dissented.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.673" offset="905110">Thus, one District Judge and one Circuit Judge has held the act inapplicable to this interlock, each holding that the statutory language was clear and unequivocal and on the other hand one Circuit Judge and one District Judge has held that the act is applicable conceding, however, and I quote, "The meaning remains equivocal" and, I quote again,</text>
            <text syncTime="223.971" offset="1038230">"the language may be read with equal plausibility. "</text>
            <text syncTime="228.904" offset="1057979">as it was read by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.666" offset="1073025">Judge Browning's opinion issued 34 months after the oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.320" offset="1103641">We urge affirmance of the District Court judgment on the grounds, first, of the face of the statute; secondly, if Your Honors get that far, the clear legislative history; and finally, 60 years of uninterpreted administrative construction of the statute by the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Congress.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="269.422" stopTime="271.707">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="269.422" offset="1220042">Do you mean uninterpreted or uninterrupted?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_simon" startTime="271.707" stopTime="1055.885">
            <label>Mr. William Simon</label>
            <text syncTime="271.707" offset="1229237">Both, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.593" offset="1248777">The language of the statute, I submit, is clear, and it appears in several places in the brief, but one page is page 2 of our brief, which is the blue brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.739" offset="1325368">And the statute provides as follows: No person at the same time shall be a director, one, in any two or more corporations; two, any one of which has capital in surplus of a million dollars... and I point out where the Congress meant any one of them; it said any one of them has capital of a million dollars; three, engaged in whole or in part in commerce, which I submit means two or more corporations engaged in whole or in part in commerce; and four, other than banks, banking associations, trust companies, and common carriers subject to the Interstate Commerce Commission Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.759" offset="1549394">In his opinion in the District Court Judge Peckham said of that language, and I quote from his opinion,</text>
            <text syncTime="360.782" offset="1585548">"An examination of this language reveals four criteria which must be met before this statute may be applied: First, a person must simultaneously serve as a director of two or more competing corporations; second, at least one of the corporations must have capital surplus and undivided profits of greater than a million dollars; third, both or all of the corporations must be engaged in interstate commerce; and fourth, the corporations must be other than banks, banking associations, trust companies, or common carriers. "</text>
            <text syncTime="403.009" offset="1754403">We submit that two corporations other than banks and common carriers excludes two corporations, one of which is a bank or a common carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.185" offset="1807170">There are three different provisions relating to three different classes of corporations in this statute as showing that Congress did not have in mind a uniform legislative purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.913" offset="1886060">The second and third unnumbered paragraphs of the House bill relate to banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.436" offset="1920124">And as presently amended, they apply only where one of the banks is a member of the Federal Reserve System and no more than a third of the banks in the country are members of the Federal Reserve System.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.778" offset="1981459">And it includes not only directors but officers and employees as to which interlocks are also prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.451" offset="2016150">The fourth... excuse me, the first unnumbered paragraph of the House bill, which is now Section 10 of the Clayton Act, relates to common carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.646" offset="2080934">It in no way prohibits interlocking directorates between competing common carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.716" offset="2121267">It provides only that when there is an interlocking directorate between a borrower and a lender or a supplier and a purchaser, that the transactions must be on public bids.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.459" offset="2188245">And then the fourth unnumbered paragraph of Section 8 is the one which we have here which throughout the legislative history was referred to as the Industrial Corporations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.990" offset="2246341">And we strongly urge that one bank and one non-bank doesn't make two bank... two corporations other than banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.249" offset="2311334">This case does not involve an exemption from the antitrust laws with the accompanying narrow rules of construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.942" offset="2370161">This is not a case like the Norris-LaGuardia Act, which exempted labor unions from antitrust laws, or the Capra-Volstead Act, which exempted farm co-ops from antitrust laws, or the Securities Act, which exempted the Stock Exchange from the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.090" offset="2446752">This case involves a requirement of the statute which is not met in the case before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.980" offset="2494295">Now, I think that that is the end of the lawsuit, but I do think if the Court goes beyond the face of the statute, the legislative history is compelling, and I would like to speak to it briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.090" offset="2562736">Mister... later Justice... Brandeis was an adviser to President Wilson in 1914, and he testified before the House Judiciary Committee on this legislation, having previously written a long series of articles on the subject matter which were published in Harpers.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.307" offset="2663569">The Pujo Committee of the Senate had conducted hearings on this subject, and its General Counsel, Samuel Untermyer testified before the House Judiciary Committee on this bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.282" offset="2711530">Both Mr. Brandeis and Mr. Untermyer urged upon the House Judiciary Committee that the bill should cover insurance-bank interlocks.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.697" offset="2765133">And they said it doesn't do it and you should amend the bill to make it cover it.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.053" offset="2782583">The House took no heed of their admonition.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.128" offset="2798883">As the bill passed the House, the second and third unnumbered paragraphs related to banks, the fourth unnumbered paragraph read as I read it to you earlier except that the "other than" clause read merely "other than common carriers".</text>
            <text syncTime="694.083" offset="2918733">It did not have the banks in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.500" offset="2928346">And at that time, the first paragraph related to common carriers but, as I noted, only borrowers and suppliers.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.615" offset="2988846">In the Senate the Senate struck all banking provisions from the bill so that as it passed the Senate the banking provisions of the House bill were eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.769" offset="3041508">When it got to conference, the House conferees insisted on putting back the House provisions on the banking provisions, and the Senate conferees ultimately said, okay, we'll put the House... we'll put those things back, but we want to put in between "other than common carriers" the words</text>
            <text syncTime="750.599" offset="3144744">"banks, banking associations, and trust companies. "</text>
            <text syncTime="753.707" offset="3157179">And so the Conference Committee Report was changed to read</text>
            <text syncTime="760.457" offset="3184241">"other than banks and common carriers. "</text>
            <text syncTime="764.205" offset="3199183">I think most conclusive on the legislative history is the fact that when the Conference Committee Report got back to the House, Congressman Mann made a point of order that the conferees had exceeded their jurisdiction in inserting the words "banks" between "other than" and "common carriers".</text>
            <text syncTime="788.194" offset="3295210">He opposed, he took the position that the Department of Justice takes before you today, and he said that the conferees had gone beyond their authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.167" offset="3339095">Congressman Shirley and Congressman Webb, who were both members of the Conference Committee, agreed with him that the bill did just what he said it did, but they argued that it did not go beyond the authority of the Conference Committee because they merely put into the statute in explicit terms what was previously implicit.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.651" offset="3440973">The Speaker, who was then Champ Clark, overruled the point of order, and the bill passed in that manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.323" offset="3483709">Because we think the debate on this point of order is so important to the legislative history, we have copied it in its totality in an appendix to our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.702" offset="3545149">And I would like to read two sentences of Congressman Mann, from A-2 of the yellow brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.725" offset="3581303">Just before the quotation in the middle of the sentence, he says, what the conferees have done is to eliminate from this section all banking corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.602" offset="3652774">And then skipping to the last five lines of the page, he says, and the conferees by their report undertake to eliminate from this prohibition of interlocking directorates not only the railroads subject to the act to regulate commerce but also banks, banking institutions, and trust companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.700" offset="3741172">And we indeed agree with that he... with what he said.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.753" offset="3757368">Now, on page 14 Congressman Shirley, who supported the Conference Report, said in a sentence beginning about two inches down from the top of the page, the conferees having redrafted the matter have gotten away from the language of Section 9 of the House and Section 7 of the Senate... and what is now Section 8 was 9 in the House and 7 in the Senate... in many particulars, concluded that it would leave no matter of argument touching the language of Section 7 and therefore the conferees inserted in the exclusion proviso what would have been held as excluded in the bill agreed to in the conference even if not put there, to wit, banks, banking associations, and trust companies, thus making it plain by the very expression itself that they... and I believe "they" refers back to the banks... that they along with the common carriers were not within the group outlined as industrial corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.337" offset="4071778">And yet, in spite of both sides agreeing that that's what the Conference Report did, although they disagreed on the propriety of doing so, the Court of Appeals, in its opinion reversing the District Court, said, and I am quoting at the top of page 24-A of the Appendix to our petition for certiorari, in the first full sentence, the Court of Appeals said, but the references in the exclusionary clause to banks and common carriers do not have a common origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.997" offset="4230393">There is no basis for the assumption that they are to be read in the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.084" offset="4262681">And the Court of Appeals went on to hold that the phrase "other than banks" was to be read "other than to banks", but the phrase "other than common carriers" was to be read "other than one common carrier".</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.927" offset="4322135">And that's exactly opposite to what both sides agreed in the debate on the point of order to the Conference Report.</text>

            <text syncTime="1083.285" offset="4475526">The banking provisions, for example, were changed five times: 1916, 1920, '28, '29, and '35.</text>

            <text syncTime="1121.775" offset="4629440">The colloquy was primarily with Congressman Mann, who made the point of order, and Congressman Webb and Shirley, who opposed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.747" offset="4665384">And they both agreed on what the point... what the language would do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.568" offset="4684610">Their difference was that Congressman Mann thought it was a bad thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.222" offset="4707285">And what he expressly said in his argument, that if you let this go through, it will permit a bank and United States Steel Corporation or a bank and the Sugar Trust Company or a bank and a hat company to have common directors, and I am against that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.231" offset="4771337">And Congressmen Shirley and Webb didn't disagree with him on what it did, but said that that was within the scope of the conferees' authority, and the Speaker agreed with him.</text>

            <text syncTime="1185.815" offset="4885649">And that was the purpose of his point of order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.881" offset="4893903">In 1965, '67, '69, '71, '74, and '75 bills were introduced into Congress that would have prohibited these interlocks, and yet not one of those bills passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.759" offset="4961404">In 1978 Congress had before it comprehensive legislation to deal with interlocks in financial institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.471" offset="5004245">And the bill that finally emerged is the Depository Institution Interlock Act of 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.971" offset="5026292">That debate took place shortly after Judge Peckham's decision in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.141" offset="5054922">And Congressman St Germain took the floor of the House and castigated Judge Peckham for his decision in this case, said it was a totally wrong decision and it ought to be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.615" offset="5100898">And he offered an amendment which would have reversed Judge Peckham's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.419" offset="5124095">The amendment was stricken, and to be sure, it was stricken on a technicality, but a technicality which could have been cured and no member of the Congress, in spite of Congressman St Germain's criticism of this case, no member of the Congress offered a proper amendment which would have overruled the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.952" offset="5226181">I submit that this Court's decision in 1980 in Merrill Lynch versus Curran and in... I am sorry, that was in 1982... and in 1980 in Seatrain versus Shell, hold that while the views of subsequent Congresses cannot overrule the unmistakable intent of the enacting Congress, they are entitled to great weight where there is any doubt of the intent of the enacting Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.273" offset="5351464">Now, although the government now claims that the statute prohibits these interlocks, they concede that they made no effort for over 60 years to enforce it, notwithstanding the fact that 40 percent of all insurance company directors in America were bank directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.804" offset="5441639">And the answer they give you in their brief is that they were spending their time on voluntary enforcement and they were trying to achieve the results voluntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.362" offset="5491794">Now, I have the greatest respect for the Department of Justice, and I think if they were really were trying to get voluntary enforcement of the statute, there would not have been 40 percent of all insurance company directors on bank boards at the time this case was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.140" offset="5566922">I suggest that they do not cite a single instance where they persuaded an insurance or bank director to voluntarily give up one of his directorships.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.867" offset="5629825">And we know of none.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.185" offset="5635154">I also suggest that a more likely answer to that situation is the holding of this Court in 1949 in the Panhandle case where it held that the failure to use such an important power for so long a time indicates a belief that the power did not exist.</text>

            <text syncTime="1508.121" offset="6174844">Fifteen months before this case was filed, the assistant attorney general in charge of the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, who filed this case, made a public statement in which he said, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.934" offset="6254152">"The Clayton Act section dealing with interlocks may not be directly applicable to financial institutions and insurance companies. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.374" offset="6291872">And he added,</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.934" offset="6298142">"It may be more of a legislative problem than an enforcement problem. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.111" offset="6322801">In 1950 a report of the Federal Trade Commission said flatly that this statute did not bar bank-insurance company interlocks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.199" offset="6371180">And 25 years later, in 1974, the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission testified before Congress that the deficiencies pointed out in their 1950 report still prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.595" offset="6420813">In 1965 a staff report of the House Judiciary Committee, and in 1968 a staff report of the House Banking Committee both alluded to the fact that these interlocks were not covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.438" offset="6480163">And I think that's particularly significant in light of the bills that I referred to earlier in this time frame where Congress refused to enact legislation that would have barred these interlocks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.178" offset="6539095">One final minor point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.900" offset="6549962">The complaint is brought against both the banks and their holding companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.172" offset="6583086">The case was tried on a stipulation of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.224" offset="6603252">The stipulation has in paragraph 9 two sentences, one of which we rely on and one on which the government relies on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.746" offset="6641391">The sentence the government relies on provides that the holding companies admit control of the bank through ownership of the stock and the election of directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.054" offset="6690606">And the government and the Court of Appeals said that makes the holding company responsible for the acts of the bank and therefore, if the bank is guilty, the holding company is guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.095" offset="6726759">But the second sentence of that very same paragraph says that the directors of the bank, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.117" offset="6762808">"manage the bank and select the officers and control its operations and activities. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.501" offset="6804395">Now, the Court of Appeals recognized, and I think it's hornbook law that a parent is not liable for the acts of its subsidiaries unless it actually operates the subsidiary company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.448" offset="6844206">And while recognizing that law, the Court of Appeals ignored it by holding the holding companies liable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.768" offset="6873463">I would like to conclude by saying that we believe the unambiguous language of the statute, the concession by both the government and the Court of Appeals that they cannot prevail without giving the words 60 years to bring a case in this area, although it had knowledge that 40 percent of insurance company directors were bank directors.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="1726.644" offset="7049006">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.914" offset="7066037">This Court is familiar with the background of the enactment of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.255" offset="7091428">That statute was passed in 1914 to supplement the Sherman Act and to correct perceived deficiencies in the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.142" offset="7118909">It was intended to arrest in their incipiency conspiracies and monopolies and trusts that would be anticompetitive and to arrest them before their consummation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.595" offset="7156735">Section 8 of the Clayton Act, which is at issue in this case, is part of that overall statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.967" offset="7182230">Its prohibition against interlocking directorates between competing corporations is likewise intended to arrest anticompetitive conduct in its incipiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.389" offset="7223921">Congress was aroused by the fact that concentration of control by a few individuals over the great corporations of the... of the country may have led to anticompetitive situations among corporations that should have been in unrestrained and active competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.035" offset="7302498">Congress feared that the interlocking directorates would lead to uniform policies among those corporations that should have been competing and that they may have led to joint action against third parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.997" offset="7346383">Congress was also specifically concerned about the concentration of control over capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.713" offset="7365192">Section 8, therefore, was designed to nip in the bud the possible antitrust violations that could arise in this setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.485" offset="7396330">Now, as the Committee Reports on the bill explain, Congress emphatically rejected the suggestion that there were not enough men in the country qualified to serve on the boards of directors of the great corporations and that these interlocking directors should be permitted to continue for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.256" offset="7475428">To the contrary, Congress concluded following on the views of the President, that the implementation of Section 8 would in fact bring new people into the boards and would bring new initiatives and new ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.924" offset="7538122">And Congress concluded that the notion that there are not enough people to go around on the boards of directors was contrary to our institutions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1864.718" offset="7601234">In this case, the petitioners, as Counsel has indicated, stipulated that the banks and insurance companies involved in this case are corporations engaged in commerce and that they are competitors, principally, in the extension of real estate and mortgage loans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.787" offset="7677512">The Court of Appeals pointed out that the substantiality of the potential competition perhaps affected by this case is indicated by stipulations that in 1975 the three banks had outstanding real estate loans of about $6 billion and the insurance companies involved had outstanding real estate loans of about $32 billion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.290" offset="7767582">Indeed, petitioners have stipulated in this case that the competition between the banks and insurance companies is not insubstantial and that they have in effect admitted for purposes of this litigation that an agreement between them to eliminate... to eliminate that competition would violate the antitrust laws, as that principle is used in Section 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.326" offset="7847726">Now, those... although these prerequisites for the application of paragraph 4 of Section 8 are satisfied in this case, petitioners nevertheless contend that they... that the interlocks between banks and insurance companies are exempt from the coverage of paragraph 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.001" offset="7906344">They rely on the phrase in that paragraph</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.000" offset="7918361">"other than banks, banking associations, and trust companies. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.418" offset="7936019">The question presented here is whether this phrase, which makes no mention of the insurance companies that petitioners claim are exempt by virtue of their interlock with the banks, whether this phrase should be construed to be limited to the banking institutions that are expressly mentioned in that phrase or whether it should be construed more broadly to exempt from coverage interlocks between a bank and insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.784" offset="8037479">Now, the statutory presumptions governing the recognition of exemptions from the antitrust laws are well established under this Court' decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.389" offset="8067990">We think that there are three principles that are especially pertinent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.871" offset="8089828">First is the... is the basic one, that the antitrust laws are to be liberally construed and correspondingly that exemptions from those laws are to be narrowly construed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2849.026" offset="11538514">But it's quite different from a separate statutory enactment, like an exemption from the... for labor or an exemption for the insurance industry, the McCarran Act or something of that kind, isn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="2858.649" offset="11576966">--Well, it's... it's... it's different in the sense that they were enacted at different times, but I think that it's... the analysis is the same in the sense that the... that the exemption for which the petitioners are arguing cuts against the grain of the... of the principal prohibition, which based on the legislative history and the broad political support that gave rise to it was... was... reflected a congressional intent broadly to attack these interlocking directorates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.251" offset="11691383">And piecing the bank paragraphs and paragraph 4 together, they together reflect a comprehensive approach to the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.257" offset="11731402">And if one reads the "other than banks" language as simply referring back to the separate regulation of banks and no broader, then you have a comprehensive package which both gives effect to the purpose of not having inconsistent treatment of banks and also gives effect to the broad congressional purpose to recognize... to prohibit these interlocks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.741" offset="11829309">On the other hand, if you give the interpretation which petitioners urge, you have an exemption for banks and insurance companies based on a clause that doesn't even mention insurance companies, situations that are concededly within the policy of what Congress was focusing on in terms of competing corporations and, therefore, cutting against the grain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.303" offset="11907572">So I think in that respect, the analysis is largely the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.290" offset="11931500">This... this brings me to the second of the points dealing with the presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.833" offset="11949681">Ordinarily, when Congress has provided for an exemption from the antitrust laws for an entity within a particular business, this Court has been reluctant to extend that immunity or exemption to arrangements between the corporations and the industry and other entities outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.420" offset="12028049">Well, here we have another situation in that... in that category where the... the clause in question is said to provide immunity not only for the banking institutions mentioned but also for insurance companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.976" offset="12078308">And thirdly, that this Court has generally recognized that where there is an antitrust immunity, that's ordinarily predicated on the existence of some regulatory authority elsewhere to protect the public interest against the sort of abuses that the antitrust laws would otherwise bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.640" offset="12160960">And in this situation, if the... if the clause upon which petitioners rely is limited to banks, then... then that pattern is sustained here because interlocks between banking institutions are in fact separately regulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.055" offset="12210592">They are separately regulated by the initial paragraphs of... of Section 8 itself, and now more recently in 1978 they are separately regulated by the Depository Institution Interlocks Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.503" offset="12260434">So on the... on the other hand, the interlocks between banks and insurance companies that we have involved in this case are not separately regulated by the initial paragraphs or by the Bank Interlocks Act, although there was an amendment offered in 1978 to... to extend the coverage to include bank-insurance company interlocks after the District Court's decision in this case, that was rejected not on the merits but because it was not... it was not germane to the bill and would have been under the Judiciary... Judiciary Committee's jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.971" offset="12406302">And along the same lines with the analysis on an exemption from the antitrust laws, we think that the analysis that... that we urge the Court to adopt is supported by looking at the structure of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.322" offset="12479654">As passed, the initial paragraphs of Section 8 cover interlocks between banking institutions with certain carefully crafted exceptions showing that where Congress wants to accept interlocks even in that category, it has done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.692" offset="12537123">The succeeding paragraph contains the general prohibition against interlocks between competing corporations generally, limited only by the phrase we have here and the common... other than common carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.715" offset="12593234">Now, it's significant that the substantive standards in the initial paragraphs of Section 8 are different from those in the... in the fourth paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.960" offset="12630223">As initially enacted, for example, the banking paragraphs barred interlocks only where one of the institutions had capital or paid-in surplus exceeding $5 million, which is a figure considerably higher than the... than the $1 million figure necessary to trigger paragraph 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.017" offset="12698455">And there was also a prohibition against interlocks in cities of 200,000 or more without regard to the amount of capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.068" offset="12738684">Under paragraph 4, in contrast, the... the standards were somewhat different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.354" offset="12755820">The initial paragraphs covered more than simply directors, they covered interlocks between other officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.394" offset="12779957">Paragraph 4 just covered directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.344" offset="12787794">And even though, as Counsel for petitioners points out, the act was amended, the initial banking paragraphs of the act were amended over the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.468" offset="12828232">Even now they contain different standards prohibiting the interlocks than those now in paragraph 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.969" offset="12850279">So we... we submit that the natural reading of the phrase upon which petitioners rely here is that it serves to ensure that the bank... bank interlocks that are governed by initial paragraphs are not also subject by the somewhat inconsistent standards in paragraph 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.812" offset="12917675">And those same, as I mentioned before, the structure of the act also suggests that Congress legislated in paragraph 4 generally with respect to interlocks and in addition legislated with respect to banks because of a concern over the concentration of capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.940" offset="12982145">If you put those together, the structure does not suggest an intent nevertheless to exempt interlocks that somehow fall between the cracks of the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.664" offset="13029061">And yet, that's essentially what petitioners urge here, because they do not, as the Court of Appeals and the Federal Trade Commission in its parallel Perpetual case found, there is no indication that Congress carefully considered the situation of interlocks between banks and competing non-banks and decided that they should be exempt from the... affirmatively decided that they should be exempt from the antitrust laws for some reason that justified an exception to the general policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.985" offset="13166361">Now, it may be that in 1914, when Congress was enacting the Clayton Act, that many of the members did not believe that banks were engaged in commerce or that insurance companies were engaged in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.329" offset="13219755">This Court had so held in Nathan versus Louisiana and in Paul Burke versus Virginia with respect to banking and insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.370" offset="13251833">And so therefore, the Congress that enacted this statute may not have been thinking of paragraph 4 as reaching those sorts of interlocks between banks and insurance companies or one or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.058" offset="13306586">But this Court made clear in Southeastern Underwriters that the... even... even though the enacting Congress may not have anticipated that this Court would subsequently rule that in that case insurance is part of commerce, that that did not mean that the language in the statute Congress enacted should be limited in that fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.222" offset="13391327">And that same principle was applied to banks and specifically to the Clayton Act in the Philadelphia National Bank case, where the Court noted in a footnote that the banks there didn't even challenge the proposition that they were engaged in commerce, citing the Court of Appeals decision in Transamerica where the Court had engaged in the same analysis under the Clayton Act, that even though the... the Congress that passed the Clayton Act may not have anticipated that banks were part of commerce, that as that language was expanded or the interpretation of that language was expanded then too the application of the act should.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.061" offset="13538658">And in fact, the Section 7 of the Clayton Act refers to corporations engaged in commerce in language that is directly parallel to paragraph 4 of Section 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.583" offset="13584738">I would like to address then, just in conclusion, the discussion of the debate on the Conference Report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.076" offset="13646700">We think in a situation like this, particularly reading the statute against its... its purposes and the structure of the act, that... that it would be particularly unwise to rely on scattered pieces of discussion in the legislative history--</text>
