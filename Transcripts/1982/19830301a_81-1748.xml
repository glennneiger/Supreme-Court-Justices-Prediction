            <label>Mr. Joshua I. Schwartz</label>
            <text syncTime="107.159" offset="574988">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="112.506" offset="596304">This case is here for a second time on writ of certiorari to review a decision of the former United States Court of Claims holding that the United States is answerable in money damages for alleged statutory violations pertaining to management by the Secretary of the Interior of timber on allotted lands of the Quinault Indian Reservation in the State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.722" offset="697241">Throughout this litigation several categories of damages have been sought by the respondents against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.044" offset="730469">These include an alleged shortfall in revenues earned on the account of the respondents owing to the Secretary's failure to obtain maximum market value from purchasers' of the Indian timber for timber sold; the Secretary's alleged failure to manage the timber on a sustained yield basis; and the Secretary's alleged failure to sell some of the merchantable timber located on the Indian allotments.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.745" offset="845303">In addition, damages are sought for the Secretary's failure to develop an optimum system of roads in the logged areas and for roadbuilding charges deducted from the revenues earned on timber sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.718" offset="897235">And finally, respondents complain that insufficient interest was paid or in some cases that no interest was paid on funds held by the Secretary on the account of the Indian respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.959" offset="946136">When this case first came before the Court of Claims, that court held that Section 5 of the General Allotment Act, pursuant to which the forested lands of the Quinault Indian Reservation had been allotted, established a general trust which included management duties, and that by necessary implication the remedy of damages was available to the respondents to redress any mismanagement of the timber resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.211" offset="1063164">This Court in the case that we call Mitchell 1 reversed that decision of the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.198" offset="1087093">The Court did not reach the question whether the creation of an express trust by statute would itself ground an action for damages against the United States, because the Court concluded that the trust that had in fact been created by the General Allotment Act was not a general trust and did not encompass duties of management.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.195" offset="1175073">This Court remanded the case to the Court of Claims to provide that court with an opportunity to reach other theories of recovery advanced by the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.652" offset="1220944">In Mitchell 2, the en banc Court of Claims, with Judge Nichols dissenting this time, again held that the United States was answerable in damages in respect of each of the respondents' major claims of injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.029" offset="1282384">The threshold, the court refused to confine the implication of a damage remedy against the United States to statutes which provide for the payment of money or which expressly provide for a damage remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.556" offset="1340585">The court then turned to the particular statutes which are involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.991" offset="1354273">These are: 25 U.S.C. 406, 407 and 466, which pertain to the sale of timber on Indian lands; another group of statutes in 25 U.S.C. 318(a) and 323 through 325, which govern roadbuilding on Indian reservations and the granting of rights of way over Indian lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.558" offset="1460539">Although the court recognized that none of these statutes expressly created a trust duty of any kind, the court held that</text>
            <text syncTime="337.497" offset="1496275">"A long continuing doctrine of governmental fiduciary obligation in the management of Indian property was. "</text>
            <text syncTime="345.003" offset="1526368">quote, "infused into these statutes".</text>
            <text syncTime="348.621" offset="1540787">And the court thought that because the purpose of the statutes generally from the point of view of the Indians was to generate revenue, it was necessary that the court imply a damages remedy to enforce the statutory requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.314" offset="1603586">Accordingly, the court held that recovery in damages of amounts that should have been earned but were not earned on the account of the Indian beneficiaries could be recovered against the United States, and that similar damages could be recovered under the roadbuilding statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.510" offset="1676311">Finally, the court held that damages could be recovered against the United States for failure to pay interest on respondents' funds held by the United States at a rate reflecting reasonable management zeal to get the best interest rate for respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.886" offset="1737855">Because of the substantial importance of the... of the doctrinal holding of the Court of Claims and because of the substantial amount of money which is at stake in this case, we have again sought this Court's review.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.279" offset="1795429">It is our central submission that the Court of Claims' analysis is inconsistent with the teaching of this Court respecting recovery of damages against the United States in that the decision below effectively dispenses with the requirement that Congress authorized the recovery of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.978" offset="1890201">The parties appear to be in agreement on one fundamental point, and that is the standard for determining whether a statute provides for the recovery of damages against the United States is that supplied by this Court's decision in United States v. Testan; that is, whether the statute... and I'd like to quote...</text>
            <text syncTime="455.722" offset="1969195">"in itself can fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation for the damage sustained. "</text>
            <text syncTime="462.212" offset="1995213">At that point agreement ends in this case, and the question is what it means to fairly... for a statute to be fairly interpretable as mandating compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.851" offset="2041711">In our own analysis we start with the language of the pertinent statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.155" offset="2058952">None of the statues involved in this case makes any mention of maintenance of litigation or recovery of damages against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.177" offset="2099076">Furthermore, although the statutes do in some instances refer to the payment of money, the Court of Claims did not suggest, nor does respondent now suggest, that their claims arise under that statutory language.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="502.803" stopTime="514.528">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="502.803" offset="2157486">I guess you would concede, wouldn't you, though, that, for instance, the timber statutes would mandate that the Government pay the allottees the money to the extent that it's earned on the timber?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joshua_i_schwartz" startTime="514.528" stopTime="605.701">
            <label>Mr. Joshua I. Schwartz</label>
            <text syncTime="514.528" offset="2204402">Yes, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.347" offset="2207746">And, in fact, we make the further point that because the statute makes that clear, it is to be assumed that Congress did not intend to sanction the recovery of some other amounts of money against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.237" offset="2255289">I would add one point of qualification.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.904" offset="2261976">The statute in fact prescribes that the money be paid to the Indians or used for their benefit, so that if the Secretary... the Secretary has the authority to do other things with the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.826" offset="2301578">But were he not to do that, he would not... the Indians would be able to maintain suit, we suppose, to compel the funds that are in hand to be disgorged.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.583" offset="2348702">It's our view that the statutory language here might be profitably compared with statutes which have been regarded as authorizing the recovery of damages against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.258" offset="2399380">A common example that comes to mind is the Federal Tort Claims Act which specifies that the United States shall be liable respecting provisions of this title relating to tort claims in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.553" offset="2468552">Another comparison might be drawn to the language of the Indian Claims Commission Act which provides that the Claims Commission shall herein determine all claims in law and equity with respect to which the claimant would have been entitled to sue in a court of the United States if the United States were sueable; and moreover, all claims based on fair and honorable dealings that are not recognized by an existing rule of law or equity.</text>

            <text syncTime="605.701" offset="2569071">Mr. Schwartz, can I interrupt a second, because Justice O'Connor's question troubles me also.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.038" offset="2590492">There's no such language in the statute that says when you sell the timber and collect some money, you pay it over to the Indians, is there?</text>

            <text syncTime="619.794" offset="2625496">Oh, no, there is such language, and I gathered that was the basis of Justice O'Connor's question, with the one qualification that I've given.</text>

            <text syncTime="664.273" offset="2803442">It is that kind of provision which we have in mind as likely grounding an action to recover monies against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.710" offset="2837192">And the existence of that language, we submit, suggests that some other larger group of monies that are not in hand and are not proceeds cannot be recovered against the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="697.927" offset="2938025">Testan, there is some inevitable grayness and fuzziness as to what is a mandate for compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.233" offset="2971253">It is our view that statutes that unequivocally direct payment of money generally, presumptively or ordinarily would be understood as sufficiently clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.222" offset="3015243">On the other hand, such statutes do not invariably ground compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.693" offset="3033111">This Court's decision last term in United States v. Erica comes to mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.060" offset="3050560">Although the Court there didn't reach a sovereign immunity issue and specified that, because it found an express bar to recovery of damages, we would suppose that the Court could have couched its holding in terms that the Government did not consent the recovery of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.120" offset="3114822">Where... where a statute provides for payment of money without any qualification, then the presumption may go one way.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.624" offset="3148781">When there is no such provision, for reasons I'd like to turn to, we think the presumption should be very strongly the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.330" offset="3183680">There's a fundamental difference that we believe should not escape notice between statutes that direct payment of money and statutes that impose nonmonetary duties upon officers of the United States.</text>

Sheehan refer to the Tucker Act as a waiver of sovereign immunity, and cases such as Mitchell 1 and Testan say that it is not, that it is merely jurisdictional; that some other statute must provide the waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.657" offset="3772898">It seems to us that it doesn't matter how you put the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.442" offset="3784079">Clearly, the Tucker Act is sufficient unto itself as a basis for recovering damages on a contract claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.863" offset="3813754">That's... the Tucker Act didn't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.465" offset="3824203">The Tucker Act didn't do anything at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.917" offset="3834025">On the other hand, we suppose... the Congress and the legislative history is consistent... that Congress did not consent to recovery of damages on any claim that might be tied to some statute which imposes a nonmonetary duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.574" offset="3884598">And the way that has been rationalized and expressed by the Court in Testan and Mitchell is that what... Congress provided jurisdiction to entertain claims where the act of Congress was of a particular character.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.517" offset="3948337">Now, one can say that as to the statutory claims, the Tucker Act is a waiver of sovereign immunity and that the other statute must provide the right of action, or one can say that the Tucker Act is merely a conditional waiver as to the statutory claims, or one can say, as Testan appears to have literally said, that it's not a waiver at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.598" offset="4024719">But the point to us seems to be exactly the same any way you read it: either the rule is that a waiver... waivers of sovereign immunity are to be strictly construed according to their terms, or else the rule is that an unequivocal sovereign immunity is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.990" offset="4082293">In either event, the other statute in addition to the Tucker Act must make clear that Congress contemplated the award of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.929" offset="4121999">And this is sort of a semantic embroglio we may have created by ourselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.333" offset="4147703">But we don't think the legal result--</text>

            <text syncTime="1009.123" offset="4182812">We do think... I'd like to explain why the provisions of statutes such as Section 406 that create nonmonetary obligations for federal officers have a different standing in the sovereign immunity analysis, if I may use that shorthand, than statutes that contemplate the payment of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.804" offset="4277584">Statutes that prescribe the payment of money create an obligation for the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.858" offset="4301721">Statues that direct federal officers to take certain action prescribe duties for officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.898" offset="4333904">And as to those statutes, absent some comment by Congress, some indication that Congress appreciated that federal officers might not perform their duties, and that the United States Treasury might thereby be impacted for... by an action for damages, we think the contrary presumption is the correct one, that Congress expected that federal officers would do what they were told, and that if they did not, the remedy available was an action to compel the performance of those statutory duties.</text>

            <text syncTime="1109.804" offset="4585515">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.837" offset="4589695">And it is our submission that the remedy that was available to enforce these nonmonetary duties was that kind of remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.576" offset="4624595">And there are a number of reasons why we believe that is the appropriate kind of remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.480" offset="4644239">Congress, in prescribing nonmonetary duties, has never shown that it appreciated that the Treasury would be held accountable for the... for the misfeasance of federal officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.122" offset="4686766">Of course, in the context of this case I use those terms because that is what is alleged, and it's never been determined whether there has in fact been any statutory violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.827" offset="4729607">The... there is another critical point here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.797" offset="4749460">The respondents argue that the value to them of performance of these duties which we call nonmonetary was financial; and I assume that that is perfectly accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.272" offset="4795435">But that in itself is not sufficient to indicate that Congress contemplated the payment of money from the United States Treasury or sanctioned that recovery as is required unless there is evidence that Congress contemplated what would happen if the federal officers did not perform their statutory duties and were allowed to go uncorrected in that course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.518" offset="4880386">In this case... I would also add that this Court's decision in United States v. Testan cannot be distinguished in the manner which is implicitly suggested by this line of argument, because the same argument could have been made in Testan, and if I read the Court's opinion correctly, essentially the same argument was made in Testan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.664" offset="4953006">The statute there involved was the Classification Act which established criteria for the grading of federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.620" offset="4992817">The value to a particular federal employee such as the respondent, Herman Testan, of such a statute was monetary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.859" offset="5021760">It came through the provision of yet another statute which said that if you're rated at GS-12 as a Government attorney, your salary is thus and so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.714" offset="5053212">The value to Herman Testan, therefore, of compliance with the Classification Act in his case was monetary as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.301" offset="5083514">But the Court refused to telescope the nonmonetary predicate duty into the monetary duty which lay behind it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.305" offset="5111517">The Court instead said you may have an action for injunctive relief, and if you were reclassified as a GS-14 attorney, then you may recovery the salary to which you would be entitled; but Congress has not authorized the recovery of damages for your misclassification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.834" offset="5181630">The same analysis applies here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.885" offset="5193855">An injunctive action may be available to compel the Secretary to alter his practices, if in fact they're improper, in the oversight of sales of Indian timber.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.926" offset="5238054">And if that is done, the provision which Justice O'Connor pointed out requiring the payment of proceeds will then round an action to make sure that those proceeds are paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.501" offset="5288314">The two steps cannot be divided, and that we take to be the teaching of Testan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.240" offset="5315272">In a sense this case stands on a... this case is an easier case, we would submit, for the Government than Testan, because in Testan if the nonmonetary duty of proper classification were properly performed, the higher salary that would be owing to the Respondent would come from the Treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.967" offset="5394162">In this case had the Government performed the nonmonetary duties that it is alleged to have improperly performed in a more suitable manner, the extra sums earned would have come from those who would have paid for the timber.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.561" offset="5452572">Therefore, there is no reason at all to expect that Congress contemplated the United States would be liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.298" offset="5479530">The two kinds of obligations are far less fungible than those involved in Testan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.971" offset="5506175">The respondents would substitute the answerability of the United States in money damages for sums that should have been garnered from a contractor who purchased Indian timber.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.359" offset="5551733">And we submit that that is an additional reason why it should not be inferred from a silent legislative record and a silent statute that Congress contemplated the recovery of money damages for... where proceeds were not actually earned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.525" offset="5636369">I'd like to turn briefly to the actual statutes involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.227" offset="5651207">There are quite a number, and frankly, this matter is not terribly susceptible of oral presentation, and I'll likely rely heavily on the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.432" offset="5688092">It is important to know, however, that there are a number of separate statutes involved here for different kinds of claims, that they can't be grouped all together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.971" offset="5726231">It's also interesting, so far as I can discern, the respondent has not even answered our argument respecting some of the statutory claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.477" offset="5760190">I don't find any arguments made in defense of the Court of Claims' holding that Section 318(a), which authorizes the appropriation of funds for building of roads on Indian reservations, somehow grounds an action for recovery of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.670" offset="5824973">I suppose it would be a very serious thing if a routine authorization statute allowed individuals who might be benefitted if the appropriations were made, would ground an action for recovery of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.810" offset="5877532">The main statute at issue here, however, is 25 U.S.C. 406(a), which governs the sale of timber on Indian allotments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.702" offset="5917133">The first thing to observe, of course, is that there is no mention of damages in the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.739" offset="5945241">And as I've said, while there is a mention of an obligation to pay out certain monies, the proceeds of the sale, there is no mention of any duty to pay out any other monies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.097" offset="5990694">The other duties are nonmonetary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.366" offset="6003755">A few other points are relevant to considering whether Congress could have intended that the United States be answerable in money damages under this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.052" offset="6038551">The first is that until 1964, the statute was a rather bare instrument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.706" offset="6061120">It's reproduced in Footnote 3 at page 3 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.458" offset="6084108">And until 1964 the statute simply said the timber on any Indian allotment held under a trust or other patent containing restrictions on alienations may be sold by the allottee with the consent of the Secretary, and the proceeds shall be paid over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.486" offset="6152235">It is difficult to imagine how Congress could have thought that that statute imposed any... created any opportunity to recover any money other than the actual proceeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.860" offset="6197793">There was no standard that the Secretary was directed to adhere to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.997" offset="6218273">There were no criteria for sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.399" offset="6231961">And I would also point out that under the statute prior to 1964, as today, the power to sell timber actually was given to the individual and not to the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.793" offset="6285460">It was the Secretary's consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.293" offset="6291520">The Secretary was to act as a constraining influence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.178" offset="6303014">Now, the Government does not deny, as this Court's opinion in White Mountain Apache v. Bracker makes clear, that it... the Secretary actually undertakes a rather comprehensive role.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.068" offset="6350557">But that role in this case, as respondent has made quite clear, was made possible not by the statute alone, but by the powers of attorney which were signed here which granted the allottee's authority to sell timber to the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.962" offset="6406146">And as we've argued in the briefs, those powers of attorney don't themselves ground an action for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.549" offset="6436552">What is relevant is that Congress, which talked in terms of the allottee selling timber, could scarcely have contemplated that the Government would be liable for the Secretary's mismanagement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.524" offset="6484409">The... I think I'd prefer to leave the balance of the detailed statutory argument for the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.731" offset="6525264">The key point is that rather than engage in anything like the kind of analysis that we've laid out, which we submit is the reanalysis required by the decision in Testan, the Court of Claims proceeded by an entirely different route.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.674" offset="6589003">It built on... it proceeded by three extrapolations of the existing law, each of which we submit to be erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.847" offset="6621708">The first was the idea that a statute need not prescribe either the recoverability of damages or require the payment of money to ground an action for compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.537" offset="6668415">The second is that even though the statues involved here do not in term speak of trust duties, that Indian... statutes governing the management of Indian property generally should be understood to have a trust character.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.997" offset="6730273">And third is it is necessary that... that given the existence of a trust duty that damages be recoverable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.603" offset="6760680">It may well be, and the decisions of this Court suggest, that statutes governing the responsibilities of the Government pertaining to Indian property are to be read with a fiduciary clause, but none of those decisions suggest that that is in itself a sufficient basis for recovery of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.183" offset="6843018">And it is a very serious matter, we submit, when the Court of Claims suggest that even though Congress did not address itself to a trust character of the duty that that trust character of the duty is somehow sufficient to ground an action for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.026" offset="6902472">If Congress had said the Secretary shall hold these lands in trust and pursuant to that trust manage these lands and assure that the highest return is earned for the allottees pursuant to prudent and professional forestry management practices, that might be a different matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.505" offset="6980317">But Congress has not created such a trust, and even if it had, the question would still remain did Congress foresee the recoverability of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.462" offset="7020128">The effect of the Court of Claims reasoning interpolating trust duties, and further, interpolating a damages remedy into a silent statute and legislative record is to engage in that kind of judicial legislation that was condemned by this Court's decision in Testan, as well as the private right of action cases that we've referred to which we think provide a cognate line of authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.113" offset="7126812">The Court in Testan said that it should not tamper with established principles because it was thought that they should be made responsive to a particular conception of enlightened Government policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.735" offset="7173310">And that, we submit, is exactly what the Court of Claims has done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.705" offset="7189088">It is for Congress and for Congress alone to prescribe the availability of damages against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.043" offset="7214479">For these reasons and the reasons stated in our written decisions, the decision of the former Court of Claims should be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1782.886" offset="7277904">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.606" offset="7312699">The opinion you're going to write in this case will be the seventh reported opinion in the history of this long case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.978" offset="7354182">The question now is simply this: When the United States takes control and custody of Indian property, in this case timber, and sells it for less than its market value, must the Government make good that loss, or is the Indian without remedy for that loss?</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.064" offset="7470583">If you rule, as the Government urges, that there is no remedy in damages, then there is no remedy at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.955" offset="7514155">Before turning to the Government's points, I'd like to state the background of this case in our terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.443" offset="7540069">These Indians aboriginally used and occupied the Olympic Peninsula of Washington and the area south of that which is an area covered by dense forest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.016" offset="7590433">In the 1850s the Government made a treaty with some of these Indians, and as to the rest of the Indians who refused to sell their land, who refused to sign that treaty, the Government simply took over the land and thereafter treated it as if they had signed the treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.580" offset="7668591">A reservation was established in the middle of this aboriginal territory for all of these Indians, those who signed the treaty and those who did not, and in time that reservation was divided pursuant to the General Allotment Act of 1887 into small 80-acre allotments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.425" offset="7748004">Each Indian got one allotment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.760" offset="7757408">All of this is well covered, and it's got a map showing aboriginal territory in the brief we filed three years ago when this case and this question were first before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.868" offset="7801816">Now, each trust allotment was a formal statutory express trust under the General Allotment Act of 1887.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.443" offset="7844134">Now, it's true, as you said three years ago, that nothing in the General Allotment Act said anything about timber management duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.013" offset="7878407">That's because the Allotment Act was not for the purpose of giving timberland to Indians; they couldn't work that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.249" offset="7903275">The purpose of the act was to give them farmland or grazing land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.468" offset="7920203">And in this case that was not possible, so what the Indians got was property that there was no way that they personally could work the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.392" offset="7963880">It was just a happenstance that they came from a part of the country where there was not enough farmland to go around.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.063" offset="7994600">Now, since this was trust land, the Indians couldn't sell their timber, even if they were knowledgeable about it and even if they wanted to sell it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.388" offset="8031902">Congress was aware of this, and in 1910... incidentally, Indians who own trust allotments are in a small minority nationwide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.793" offset="8077460">Nationwide, most Indians have trust allotments that are farmland or grazing land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.380" offset="8099821">In 1910 Congress had heard that the Indians weren't getting any revenue out of their timber, and that was an unfortunate thing, and Congress ought to do something about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.169" offset="8139004">So Congress passed the Act of 1910, which is the principal act upon which we rely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.006" offset="8166381">That act says that the timber on these trust allotments can be sold by the Indian with the consent of the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.510" offset="8196369">Now, merely consenting to the sale of the timber doesn't on its face sound like the Secretary is being given much authority to manage and sell this timber; but it really does mean that in practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.352" offset="8251749">When you look at what's involved in selling timber, which is you require a high degree of know how and you require resources to get the timber out of there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.208" offset="8291142">Selling and logging timber is a sophisticated process, and it can't be handled by an untrained person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.714" offset="8321130">To his credit, the Secretary realized this, and right from the beginning he interpreted the 1910 Act as giving him the authority to manage these timber sales, and that's what he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.339" offset="8363658">He wrote very extensive regulations beginning in 1911, the year after the act, and he employed a large staff to manage these sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.611" offset="8404722">You referred to this same comprehensive management system in White Mountain Apache v. Bracker which you decided three years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.898" offset="8433875">I might add that starting in 1920, Congress authorized the Secretary to begin charging a fee for his services, and the Secretary did so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.775" offset="8485388">He enacted regulations that permit fees up to 10 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.427" offset="8503987">In 1941 some of the Indians objected to this comprehensive control that the Secretary was exercising over their land, and they went to court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.051" offset="8542544">They sued for an injunction to make the Secretary stop exercising all this control over their land which they felt was not good management.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.906" offset="8577966">The Ninth Circuit said that the Secretary's interpretation of the act was correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.976" offset="8602208">In 1946 Congress amended the 1910 Act... excuse me, 1964... Congress amended the 1910 Act, and they made explicit at that time some of the factors that the Secretary had already read into the 1910 Act, such as the need to maintain the productive capacity of the land and the best interests of the Indian allottee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.758" offset="8697398">There are other relevant statutes such as those requiring the Secretary to manage the timber on a sustained yield basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.778" offset="8729476">That was contemplated actually in the 1910 Act, but it wasn't made an express statutory command until 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.134" offset="8766884">Another one is the suite of statutes authorizing the Secretary to grant rights of way to outsiders across Indian land upon payment of compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.375" offset="8807844">Still another is authorizing him to invest timber proceeds and other money for the benefit of the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.612" offset="8840758">Incidentally, that's not a statute calling for interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.564" offset="8852565">It's a statute calling for investment, and the investments are limited to federal securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.651" offset="8880882">These statutes are all part of one statutory program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.119" offset="8898750">The basic act is the General Allotment Act which established the trust, which admittedly with respect to timber was a bare trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.227" offset="8935217">The statutes supplementing the General Allotment Act are, as I've said, the 1910 Act, the 1964 Act amending it, the 1934 sustained yield act, the right of way acts, and the interest acts... excuse me, the investment acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.670" offset="9001045">Now, so far I've been talking about individual Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.924" offset="9026018">The tribe owns timber also, and they are a plaintiff in this case also.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.227" offset="9051200">As to them, the Secretary treated their timber essentially the same as he did the tribal timber under another section of the 1910 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.602" offset="9088712">The tribal timber was not held in trust under the General Allotment Act, but it was held in trust under other acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.522" offset="9116402">One act was the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, and there were several other special acts whereby Congress made direct grants of land to the tribe in trust for the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.514" offset="9168333">These are cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.366" offset="9179827">Now, none of the tribal trusts spelled out any particular duties either any more than the General Allotment Act did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.520" offset="9204382">So the duties that we argue are present were infused into these trusts by the supplementary, same supplementary acts that I've just mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.760" offset="9249313">The first time we were here three years ago we argued that the fact that the United States held the land in trust for the Indians was enough just by itself to ground them, to ground their right for damages for trust mismanagement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.653" offset="9304902">You said no, the trusts taken by themselves don't spell out any duty to manage timber, so first we have to find some statutory basis for a duty to manage timber.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.628" offset="9348787">And then you said assuming we can do that, we also have to show that the... the other statute that we're relying on that bring out these duties must be fairly interpreted as mandating compensation for the damage sustained under the Testan rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.237" offset="9415243">We went back to the Court of Claims, and the Court of Claims agreed after argument and re argument, both times en banc, they finally agreed 6 to 1 that the statutes I mentioned supplementing the General Allotment Act did impose duties to manage timber and could fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation for the damage sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.666" offset="9508970">Now, here's the difference between the majority of the Court of Claims and the dissenting judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.720" offset="9529241">The dissenting judge felt with the supplementary statutes that I mentioned, the 1910 Act and so forth that supplement the General Allotment Act, could not be fairly interpreted as requiring compensation except to the extent that... and I think this is a fair characterization of what he said... except to the extent that they would support an action for liquidated damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.168" offset="9615027">He didn't use the term "liquidated", but that's what he meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.018" offset="9626417">He meant where you can tell the amount of damages without much difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.488" offset="9644284">The majority, on the other hand, was unwilling to be that narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.207" offset="9659122">They felt if the total trust program showed a presently existing legal right to revenue, as they did, at least in the case of those allotments that had been logged, that would be enough to permit a suit for damages to cover the revenues properly... improperly diminished or the value of the principal improperly lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.972" offset="9750237">The court was narrow in other respects, however.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.441" offset="9768105">It threw out our claims for consequential damages, as it called them, and certain claims which involved Government discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.815" offset="9805617">It limited us strictly to claims for value lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.803" offset="9829545">I now begin my argument, and the content of my argument consists primarily of the reasons why our case is different from the Testan case and meets the standards laid down in that case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2490.161" offset="10106965">And you have to show that the statute under which you claim contemplates, impliedly or expressly, a remedy of damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="2506.507" offset="10172376">They don't expressly, obviously.</text>

            <text syncTime="2763.879" offset="11201809">For jurisdictional purposes the trust fills the same office as the contract does in a contract case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.699" offset="11229081">The question of what duties were breached in the course of operating that trust or contract we would have thought, our preference would have been to have that litigated after the case begins, because so often these duties are closely interwoven with the facts; and it is a problem of judicial administration to try to pull that problem out and deal with it first, and then if you win that, go on to your merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.350" offset="11331690">To us, the proper law should be that if you prove the existence of the trust and that it has some duties, then you're past the jurisdictional hurdle; then you must show that those duties required action that the Government didn't take or prohibited action that the Government did take, and if so, how much the loss of value was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.515" offset="11432418">Now, the Court of Claims held that that was the correct law, starting with the Klamath case in 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.137" offset="11462825">So when we filed our case in 1971, that had been the law expressly for five years, and the Court of Claims after that Klamath case in 1966, a dozen cases had ruled to that effect up until your Testan case when the question arose that we're now discussing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.801" offset="11545476">That's also true in a number of other federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.220" offset="11563240">The Moose case, which we've cited in our brief, decided by the Ninth Circuit, both the majority and the dissenter thought that the existence of the trust was all you needed to get through the Tucker Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.578" offset="11620604">That case was decided after Testan and Mitchell, and therefore considered itself in harmony with both of your opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.766" offset="11653414">The Whiskers case in the Tenth Circuit, also cited in our brief, that was decided after Testan but before Mitchell.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.072" offset="11682567">They said that if you prove the trust, you have proved all you need to to get into court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.809" offset="11705555">And there are two additional district courts, different district courts, different judges, in California who have also ruled to the same effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.982" offset="11746201">And that was the view of the three dissenting Justices, I believe, as I read them, when this case was here before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.355" offset="11775772">But the majority of you seemed to feel that the question of what duties the trust imposed was part of the Testan analysis and therefore a threshold issue that had to be adjudicated before the merits were reached to see if they mandated compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.630" offset="11840869">I have to express the hope that once the law is sorted out, if it is sorted out in our favor, that it would be possible to handle that question during the trial of the merits rather than as a preliminary question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.326" offset="11907638">Now, I come now to the part of my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.246" offset="11935328">The Government says the ultimate question here is one of congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.764" offset="11957375">We agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.600" offset="11968764">If Congress had said what it wanted, we wouldn't be here; so we have to look to secondary sources to see what Congress intended, and the intent we're looking for is an intent that these plaintiffs have money damages for the vindication of their right, which everyone concedes that they have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.746" offset="12049326">They have the right but... they have the right, but the question is whether it's vindicatable in damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="2983.950" offset="12082136">And, of course, underlying every point I make is well, how is our case different from Testan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.189" offset="12119125">Well, first of all I'm going to go through eight points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.276" offset="12139396">The first point is that there is the trust relationship here which was not present in the Testan case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.347" offset="12163742">Congress created a trust in 1877.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.967" offset="12182237">Then it infused additional duties into that trust in 1910 and after.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.304" offset="12207524">As this Court held in the Bracker case, the purpose of that trust, or at least the management of the timber in trust, was to generate for the Indians whatever profit the forest was capable of yielding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.964" offset="12262172">That's a quotation from your White Mountain Apache, 448 U.S. 149.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.635" offset="12288817">These regulations dealing with this trust timber were approved by the Ninth Circuit in the Eastman case in 1941.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.407" offset="12323925">When Congress creates a trust, we submit that Congress intends whatever remedy is necessary to carry out that trust, if the trust is breached.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.464" offset="12376170">Since the purpose of this trust was to generate money, it follows that Congress' intent following the purpose of the trust was to make up for that money if the Government by improper action caused a loss of that money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.160" offset="12438969">In Testan you didn't have a trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.526" offset="12448373">In fact, you didn't even have a contracted employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.064" offset="12462583">The second point is this: if you feel that more than the bare trust is required, well, it so happens that we have an actual glimpse of the intent of Congress, the actual intent of Congress here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.775" offset="12533427">In 1946 Congress passed the Indian Claims Commission Act, and part of that was what we call the Indian Tucker Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.129" offset="12566864">The Indian Tucker Act was in effect a repetition of the Tucker Act and made applicable to Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.866" offset="12589747">And the legislative history clearly shows that they expected Indian breach of trust suits to be brought under that act for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.722" offset="12621199">I'd like to read you a couple of quotes in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.924" offset="12634051">If you want to follow them with me, it's on page 28 of our red brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.161" offset="12658920">I think the language is so strong I'd like to have it before all of us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.432" offset="12688072">The sponsor of this act and the provision we're talking about was Henry Jackson of Washington, now Senator Jackson.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.288" offset="12727465">He said in the course of the debate that,</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.456" offset="12744183">"The Interior Department itself suggested that it ought not be in a position where its employees can mishandle funds and lands of a national trusteeship without complete accountability. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.082" offset="12794652">"Let us see that the Indians have their fair day in court so that they can call the various government agencies to account on the obligations that the federal government assumed. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.488" offset="12840314">And the House report, following the same trend, said,</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.742" offset="12861316">"If we fail to meet these obligations by denying access to the courts when trust funds have been improperly dissipated or other fiduciary duties have been violated, we compromise the national honor of the United States. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.052" offset="12922547">I don't see how you can read that language and conclude that Congress didn't intend for breach of trust actions involving damages to be brought under the Indian Tucker Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3205.376" offset="12967791">Well, but that would all be... if you read the Indian Tucker Act that way, then Mitchell was wrongly decided, wasn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="3212.265" offset="12995377">I can't speak to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.567" offset="13008542">That's a complex question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.250" offset="13015334">But it is a fact that the Indian Tucker Act has a legislative history showing that it was intended that suits brought under it for breach of trust could... could be brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.574" offset="13064653">My third point is the negative inference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.943" offset="13078133">In the Testan case the claimant was seeking back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.263" offset="13099344">Now, Congress had carefully spelled out what remedy you get when you're misclassified, and one of the remedies it did not mention was back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.785" offset="13137483">There was another possible act, the Back Pay Act, but that clearly did not apply because it only applied to people who were removed from a position they held.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.341" offset="13175726">It did not apply to people like Testan who didn't hold the position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.879" offset="13193803">Well, if Congress says if the Government breaches its duty you get to do A, that's an implication that they thought about and didn't intend for you to get B.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.435" offset="13240092">So there's a negative inference present in Testan that's not present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.190" offset="13267050">I think that the next point, my point number four, supports that, buttresses it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.462" offset="13304144">Testan was claiming a right not known in common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.031" offset="13318459">He was claiming a right created by Congress, which was the right to equal pay for equal work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.735" offset="13345209">Now, it's reasonable to say for a right that was created in the beginning by Congress with no comparable rights in common law, it's reasonable to say what remedy did Congress want when it created this new right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.333" offset="13431622">And I think it was fair to ask in the Testan case that if Congress is going to create a right, it'd better then spell out what remedy it wants to go with this new right; otherwise, we're at sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.225" offset="13479269">We don't know what kind of remedy Congress wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.110" offset="13490763">But what about our case?</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.460" offset="13496196">Our case involves a trust relationship, which is very well known in common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.680" offset="13516990">We think that the proper presumption is that when Congress recognizes a right, creates a right, if you like, but a right well known in common law such as this trust right, that it intends the ordinary and usual remedy for breach of trust, unless it gives some indication to the contrary, which it did not do in our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.310" offset="13603507">Of course, common law for a breach of trust, damages is the absolutely regular remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.033" offset="13634436">Five, the canons of construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.818" offset="13645617">You've ruled many times that the canons of construction call for construing statutes in favor of Indians when those statutes are intended for the benefit of Indians, as these are.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.626" offset="13692846">And that includes cases where the Indian interests are in competition with those of the United States, as here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.246" offset="13719282">Our Footnote 23 lists some of the cases so holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.866" offset="13741747">Our point six is present right versus future right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.051" offset="13754495">Testan only had a future right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.001" offset="13762332">He had to first get classified to where he said he should be before he had a right to money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.755" offset="13785320">We have a present right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.674" offset="13793052">Once the Secretary started to log our timber, we had a right that it be done properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.576" offset="13812591">Therefore, we're like Wickersham, a case you cited in the Testan case, where he held his position and was removed from it, and therefore had a present right to be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.569" offset="13864627">Point seven is consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.204" offset="13879151">We're paying a good price to have the Secretary perform these services, whereas this is not a gratuitous action... service provided by the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.911" offset="13925963">In addition to actual money consideration, there's another consideration point that has been recognized by President... all Presidents since President Nixon and by many cases, and that is this: These lands are part of the great transaction with Indian tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.475" offset="14008196">When the United States took over lands from the Indians, it made a bargain, which has been recognized by the courts even though the treaty may not have said it in so many words.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.864" offset="14049783">And the bargain was: You come under our protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.616" offset="14060755">We'll take the land you don't need, and we'll educate you and bring you to the point of competency; and in the meantime we'll hold your land in trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.173" offset="14102969">The eighth one, the final point I want to make, is the intent of Congress that you found in the Capoeman case... and Capoeman is one of the plaintiffs in this case... that was a tax refund case, and you held that there was an implied exemption to the federal income tax because when Congress set these lands aside, it did not intend that their value be depleted by taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.174" offset="14219057">Well, it seems that we have the same situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.892" offset="14233894">If Congress intended that the trust property be undepleted by federal taxes, doesn't it follow that it shouldn't be depleted by federal mismanagement?</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.266" offset="14279347">Why should our case be any different... this is a new line of argument... why should our case be any different because our property is timber rather than money?</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.157" offset="14326995">If we had money, we could sue for breach of trust, for failure to manage the money properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.861" offset="14353744">That's the Moose case, the Whiskers case, the dissent below admits that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.399" offset="14375896">How can you justifiably draw a distinction between timber and funds, especially when the purpose of managing the timber is to generate money?</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.271" offset="14415393">And finally, as we've made out in our brief, we have a contract here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.476" offset="14444232">The power of attorney, which is reproduced at Appendix 1 of our red brief, appoints the United States to be the agent of the allottee and to sell his timber and to</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.550" offset="14492507">"do all, perform every act necessary and requisite to the consummation of the sale. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.271" offset="14515390">That means the whole panoply of actions that the Secretary did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.356" offset="14535765">And that power of attorney also authorizes the Secretary to charge a fee for that service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.827" offset="14557604">Now, we think there was a meeting of the minds here; that the allottee expected not only that his timber would be managed, but that it would be managed competently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.182" offset="14595011">We can look to the legislative history of the 1910 Act for that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.600" offset="14616745">The Government spells it out pretty well in Footnote 25, showing that the question of whether the Secretary was going to be a competent manager was an important point during the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.742" offset="14665333">These Indians had a right under the 1910 Act to competent management, and that takes expression in the power of attorney that's reproduced in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.487" offset="14744222">If the Court has no further questions, that concludes my argument.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joshua I. Schwartz</label>
            <text syncTime="3657.824" offset="14777659">Briefly, Mr. Chief Justice, two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3661.961" offset="14794169">The first is that respondents' argument proceeds as though the statutes in issue here expressly declared a trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.150" offset="14826874">That is not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.266" offset="14831367">Their text does not support that reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="3673.732" offset="14841293">And as I understand respondents' argument, the view is that these statutes expanded the General Allotment Act trust, but none of the statutes refer to the General Allotment Act; and it's clear that all of the statutes apply to properties that are not subject to the General Allotment Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3692.946" offset="14918093">The statutes are either adequate on their own or not to create a damage remedy, and there's simply no nexus that's apparent from the statutory language or the legislative history that would suggest this was a congressional attempt to expand the General Allotment Act duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3711.425" offset="14991968">If I can return to the question of the relationship between this and the private right of action cases, we agree that there is much in common between the two lines of analysis, and in both the rule is, as the Court said in Touche Ross and Reddington, the ultimate question is one of congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3730.837" offset="15069708">And the Court's refusal in Testan to go beyond that intent speaks to the same kind of analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3737.573" offset="15096562">But we would add that the private right of action cases rarely distinguish between damages remedies and injunctive remedies, and that because of the background of sovereign immunity there's an extra layer of... an extra requirement of special clarity that Congress intended a damages remedy so that the showing... the showing required in the ordinary private right of action cases should be applied especially strictly in this context.</text>
