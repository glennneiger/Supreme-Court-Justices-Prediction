            <label>Mr. David B. Frohnmayer</label>
            <text syncTime="98.102" offset="538601">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.178" offset="550931">Today, the state of Oregon asks this Court to finetune a salutary rule in order to make it more workable in the real world.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.722" offset="581129">The question is whether Miranda versus Arizona allows reasonable police investigation into serious crime, including allowing the innocent to clear their names from suspicion, or whether the Miranda and Edwards doctrines will be misconstrued to imprison potential suspects in a web of their privileges or prohibit them from changing their minds.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.338" offset="667542">This case is here today because the Oregon Court of Appeals overextended Edwards versus Arizona and distorted the very protections this Court established in Miranda versus Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.928" offset="709860">The facts, I believe, may be briefly summarized.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.114" offset="722608">Bradshaw's contact with law enforcement authorities arose both because he was a suspect in a vehicular homicide and because he claimed to have been the victim of a criminal assault.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.939" offset="765971">At the request of the Oregon state police, he answered questions about inconsistencies between the story he had volunteered and the accounts of other witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.731" offset="801080">Prior to this questioning, he was advised of his Miranda rights and he was told that he was not under arrest and that he was free to leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.041" offset="834307">Based on certain admissions that Bradshaw made during questioning at the Rockaway police station, Corporal Hays then placed him under arrest for furnishing liquor to a minor and advised him again of his Miranda rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.207" offset="886970">Shortly thereafter, when Corporal Hays suggested to the accused a theory that Bradshaw had been the driver of the car and was responsible for the homicide, Bradshaw stated he wanted an attorney</text>
            <text syncTime="197.546" offset="936394">"before it goes very much further. "</text>
            <text syncTime="199.499" offset="944231">The interview was promptly terminated and Bradshaw was transported to Tillamook county jail for booking.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.042" offset="970353">At some point during this process, Bradshaw asked the question,</text>
            <text syncTime="210.369" offset="987698">"Well, what is going to happen to me now? "</text>
            <text syncTime="213.133" offset="998774">The testimony is unchallenged that Corporal Hays then immediately reminded the accused of his right to counsel and that he did not have to talk.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.208" offset="1035032">Bradshaw stated, "I understand".</text>

            <text syncTime="265.098" offset="1206604">And the record also shows that the police contacted, at the request of the accused, Bradshaw, a person by the name of Irma Stockdale, but beyond that, the record is silent with respect to--</text>

            <text syncTime="288.696" offset="1300959">That's correct, bearing in mind, of course, that the events I'm describing occurred on a Sunday evening, during the weekend period of time in a small town on the Oregon coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.756" offset="1333246">The interview... testimony is unchallenged that, of course, the accused was immediately reminded that he did not have to talk and that he had the right to an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.221" offset="1371071">Bradshaw stated that he understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.986" offset="1382147">In the wide-ranging conversation that then ensued in the drive to the Tillamook county jail, no incriminating statements were elicited, but Bradshaw did agree to take a polygraph test the next morning to test the veracity of his story.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.027" offset="1438258">The next morning, which was a Monday morning, another Oregon state police officer explained to Bradshaw the polygraph test procedures and readvised him again of his Miranda rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.678" offset="1484861">He told Bradshaw that although he waived the right to counsel he could stop the test and speak to an attorney at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.254" offset="1507222">Bradshaw then signed a written acknowledgement and waiver of his rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.908" offset="1525821">The waiver included both a consent to take the polygraph test and a consent to talk to the Oregon state police.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.437" offset="1551943">After the test and in the course of a conversation initiated by defendant's questions relating to polygraph procedures, Bradshaw ultimately made the incriminating admissions which are in issue today.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.261" offset="1599277">The trial court found after hearing testimony concerning these events that there had been no threats, promises or inducements leading to these admissions, and that although Bradshaw had once expressed a desire for counsel, he had simply changed his mind.</text>

            <text syncTime="779.731" offset="3265158">Now that, it seems to me, is exemplary police procedure and yet, it's ironic that the Oregon Court of Appeals, purporting to apply the decision of this Court in Edwards versus Arizona said that that was somehow improper police activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1049.921" offset="4345896">And let me say this, that even if, even in this calculus, what the defendant says in the course of the initiation of his exchange may well bear on the Johnson versus Zerbst calculus of knowing, intelligent and voluntary waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.165" offset="4410889">And let me return then to what, in fact, the defendant said in this case because it was not may I have a drink of water, or when is my lawyer coming, again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.536" offset="4444325">It was a question which was, at worst, ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.972" offset="4458118">In our judgment, it could well have been a global question, in the largest sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.361" offset="4475672">What's going to happen to me, as a consequence of my involvement in the criminal justice process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.343" offset="4495525">That may be why the question was immediately followed by Corporal Hays' reassertion and reminder to the defendant that he might be about to say something very damaging and that he ought to know that he had a right to an attorney and a right to remain silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.884" offset="4553726">But in any event, it clearly was not a trivial question that was asked in this case, and the police officer, out of an abundance of caution, wanted to make it clear to the accused, and the record shows he did so because he wanted to be fair to the accused, that before anything else transpired, that the accused was reminded of his rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.469" offset="4632093">So quite apart from whatever might be low-level exclusions from the notion of initiating dialogue, this example hardly falls within that outer periphery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.106" offset="4674621">As I mentioned, unlike Edwards, the police didn't initiate this exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.416" offset="4695832">Unlike Edwards, the accused was not told by a jailer or by a police officer that he had to talk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.852" offset="4721641">Unlike Edwards, the accused did not decline to meet with the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.475" offset="4740136">Unlike Edwards, upon the reinitiation of conversation, the police promptly showed exemplary respect for the defendant's rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.127" offset="4770647">Unlike Edwards and other cases, there is not a whisper of police trickery or deceit in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.734" offset="4797083">The facts show, in fact, a reasonable response by a police officer to the accused's ambiguous question about his status and the context shows an abundance of caution lest the defendant's question could reasonably be understood to be a global one.</text>

            <text syncTime="1196.580" offset="4932502">In fact, it's a little bit hard to tell from the record precisely when that occurred and it's interesting to note that the trial judge felt that the agreement to take the polygraph was itself not the result of interrogation at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.888" offset="4981716">Now that decision, of course, by the police officer... by the trial judge was made prior to whatever information of his judgment might have been rendered by Rhode Island versus Innis, decided subsequently to be the facts in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.446" offset="5035946">But certainly, the ride in the police car is a... and the wide ranging conversation shows itself a low level of coercion, if any at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="1311.271" offset="5391316">The record is unclear with respect to the first because we have only the recollection of the officer, which is, although it is uncontroverted by the accused, as to what occurred in the Rockaway county jail and enroute to the Tillamook county jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.076" offset="5450458">And there the defendant apparently repeated his story that he had been the victim of an assault and the thrust of the police officer's response to that was a polygraph would help to clear this up.</text>

            <text syncTime="1442.840" offset="5917527">I believe he in fact reminded him in a much more extended way, which is actually set forth in detail in the transcript and is available for the Court's perusal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.979" offset="5946157">But here is our problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.229" offset="5951068">If the initiation standard of Edwards means something more than the initiation of dialogue, however trivial or however serious, then the police officer's only response may well be one of silence because of the officer's uncertainty with respect to whether or not the question is one of overall significance to the case or merely a trivial one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.814" offset="6041452">Now that is precisely the kind of Kafkaesque imprisonment of a person in the web of his or her own privileges, the denial of meaningful information to the accused, which members of this Court have long condemned as being counter to the meaning of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.979" offset="6102056">The second point of my argument is this, that the Johnson versus Zerbst standard was met after the threshold of initiation was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.648" offset="6136746">The defendant has never challenged Zerbst below and its objection in this Court is, we believe, misdirected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.926" offset="6161929">Applying Zerbst to the facts of this case, it was clearly a knowing waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.893" offset="6181782">He was told.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.127" offset="6186693">He was reminded of his rights... he was told of his rights, read his rights twice, reminded a third time and then, before he took the polygraph that ultimately was the only device that secured from him his incriminating admissions, he was advised in oral and written form, comprehensively and exhaustively, in eight checked-off places on a form that he signed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.807" offset="6265373">It was intelligent, because he said I understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.648" offset="6284809">The trial court finding was that there was no duress or coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.678" offset="6300900">He said repeatedly to the officer, and the testimony is uncontroverted, I want to clear this thing up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.112" offset="6326604">Unlike Edwards, he was not told he had to talk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.220" offset="6339039">It was precisely the converse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.455" offset="6344054">The first thing that he was told in response to the assertion of his rights was that he had... he was reminded of his rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.655" offset="6372789">Consider how far afield this is from the Miranda cases and its progeny and the coercion that they were designed to prevent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.355" offset="6403613">No wearing down of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.822" offset="6413435">No incommunicado holding, no trickery, deceit, no evidence of insufficient intelligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.695" offset="6436946">Repeated efforts to advise of rights, a wide ranging conversation about everything from police officers one knows to who lives in St. Helens, Oregon, showing if anything the low level of coercion, if any.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.065" offset="6482399">No undermined will.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.424" offset="6487937">Repeated attempts by the police to inform the defendant where he stood.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.625" offset="6504655">Our final contention is that if the initiation requirement of Edwards must be construed to compel the result in the Oregon Court of Appeals, then we respectfully suggest that the modified per se test of Edwards should be reformulated because we believe that that modified per se test establishes a distinction between the Fifth Amendment right to silence and right to counsel, which is not in that amendment itself and was suggested by Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.708" offset="6613011">And we suggest that it is a per se rule which ironically enough could encourage the police rather than discourage them from answering legitimate questions that help inform the defendant about his own status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.797" offset="6669331">And of course, it may completely exclude a voluntary change of mind of the defendant because a particular initiation threshold doesn't happen to be present in a given case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.699" offset="6713008">We fail to understand, and that's why the perplexity we advance in our brief, why, though both rights are derived from the Fifth Amendment and why it's the Fifth Amendment right to silence that is being protected, a waiver of the right to silence is less rigorous than a waiver of the derivative Fifth Amendment right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.440" offset="6787927">Our response to the Court would simply be that the request for counsel does not invariably mean the defendant is less able to protect his own rights under all circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.406" offset="6831813">That assumption is not, we believe, invariably warranted by the endless variety of facts which other tests can better measure.</text>

            <text syncTime="1724.025" offset="7042255">Second, and probably most important in this case, there must be some passage of time between the request for the lawyer and any language that's claimed by the prosecution to be initiatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.362" offset="7095649">Now, another factor and the third factor to be considered is that if there is any physical separation between the accused and the police officers in space which goes along with the time aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.717" offset="7141102">And fourth, and more important I think probably is the initiation words using implication... must be an implication of giving up the previous request for the lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.041" offset="7190317">The defendant must move from Mosley representing himself or Edwards asking for help over to the Mosley side of it, where he is going to represent himself, he is going to keep the lines of communication open.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.487" offset="7248100">This Court has recognized that conversations between police officers, like in Innis, are going to happen, which are commonplace, not necessarily relevant to the criminal investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.374" offset="7287702">Likewise, I think in Edwards, this Court acknowledges the fact that there are going to be conversations between the defendant and the police officer that aren't necessarily tied to the criminal investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.059" offset="7330438">Examples have been asked for and given here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.947" offset="7341932">Now again the idea here... we're not just dealing with a Mosley situation, we're dealing with a request for a lawyer which carries a much heavier burden of proof because it incorporates also the idea of the self-incrimination aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.724" offset="7389057">He's asking for assistance, for help.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.035" offset="7398356">This standard... and third, the idea of initiation is not just a voluntary thing, it also involves the more complex aspect of the intelligent, understanding; knowing waiver aspect that this Court discussed about the Arizona Supreme Court's interpretation using a consent Fourth Amendment claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.355" offset="7475574">It has to involve the passage of time and some meditation, some thought process, to give up the seating of interrogation, which Bradshaw asked for when he asked for a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.539" offset="7520296">Now moving first of all to the words relevant to the criminal investigation, what's going to happen to me now, I don't read the record the same way as the Attorney General reads it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.533" offset="7572332">I read it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.470" offset="7580064">Officer Hays, the police officer, he arrests Bradshaw on the furnishing charge and at that time, right within seconds he accuses him of killing Reynolds, being responsible for killing Reynolds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.574" offset="7636489">Then he advises him of his Miranda rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.167" offset="7642862">And then Bradshaw says, I want a lawyer, or words to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.806" offset="7665432">And then within seconds, although the record doesn't reflect this but it has got to be seconds, the only act or the only thing that happened between his request for a lawyer and this comment here about what's going to happen to me now, is handcuffing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.410" offset="7711826">And that was at the police station and that was within seconds, I would say to give the state the benefit of the doubt, 120 seconds, two minutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2239.910" offset="9105824">That was after he readvised him, when he made this remark, what's going to happen to me now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.470" offset="9124110">A clear case, in answer to Justice O'Connor's question, the true, the true example of initiation can be found again in Officer Hays' testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.731" offset="9169145">Right after he readvises Bradshaw of his rights, after Bradshaw has said, hey, what's going to happen to me now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.651" offset="9200805">Then Officer Hays answers the question, puts him right into the police car in the front seat to talk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.725" offset="9229122">And if you'll look at the record, the first two things that Officer Hays testifies to is I put him in the front seat to talk and I accused him of killing Reynolds, again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.831" offset="9261514">It's a classic case of initiation, very similar to what happened in Mosley, but they visited him the next day.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.437" offset="9291920">But again, that's the real case of initiation and not what's going to happen to me now, right after being handcuffed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.591" offset="9320551">And that's in the transcript, and that's the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.872" offset="9333716">The one real single factor, and I think in this case, that really stands out as the most important criteria, if I can get to that, is the fact that from the time of the request for the lawyer and from the time that he makes this remark, again we're talking about just seconds, even in Mosley talking about the self-incrimination aspect, there was at least over two hours, a different police officer and a different crime, when this standard of an intelligent waiver could be applied to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.390" offset="9447715">It is difficult for me to understand, if we're going to use this initiation concept as a rule that can cut off and cease questioning, like happened with Mosley, and apply this qualified rule and not as strict rule where we have to wait to have a lawyer come in and talk to him, where we have to have that buffer, and certainly under these, Johnson versus Zerbst and all these cases, we can't have Bradshaw making an intelligent decision to initiate this thing and to reopen the dialogue in 60 seconds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.519" offset="9568296">If we take the attorney... and this is also, I might add, if you take this event of initiation and move it closer in time to the request for the lawyer and eventually where they almost stand on top of each other, we've almost got this conjunctive of Bradshaw saying, I want a lawyer, and what's going to happen to me, now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.933" offset="9645932">As you move these two events closer and closer, I think to have any real meaning to initiation, you have to come closer and closer to an express form of recision of that request.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.366" offset="9691698">And that's consistent with Butler, which of course was a nonrequest for attorney cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="2843.932" offset="11521942">And for this reason, I think that as far as all four of these criteria that I'm talking about, the concept of initiation in creating that buffer and that protection for the accused is pretty much going to mean not very much any time you say anything that's going to allow the police officers to reaccuse you and keep the dialogue going.</text>

            <text syncTime="3013.365" offset="12199662">The record would also show that the defendant was not handcuffed prior to arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.801" offset="12225367">At bottom, let me summarize our response to defendant's arguments this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.829" offset="12249504">There are two fundamental flaws to Bradshaw's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.233" offset="12263088">First of all, it confuses initiation and waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.920" offset="12277821">It telescopes two distinct but related inquiries into one which is directly contrary, in our view, to the Edwards footnote and to Wyrick versus Fields.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.838" offset="12317527">Initiation is only the threshold incurring which must be overcome after which waiver is determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.101" offset="12338634">Second, if initiation means something more than the simple face of the language, which the Edwards decision suggests, then this Court inherits a legal quagmire, a hopeless series of legal Rubic's cubes of dispute as to the meaning of thousands of potential utterances that might be initiated by defendant as to whether they do or they don't have particular legal significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.967" offset="12426092">We believe in fact that the question uttered by defendant here did and was related to the investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.902" offset="12449811">But the point is, one can't always tell.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.886" offset="12461723">It ignores the give and take of conversation, which this Court wisely recognized in Footnote 9 of Edwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.633" offset="12488681">The mixed conversation, which this Court recognized would occur once defendant and the police officers again begin their conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.021" offset="12518252">And ironically enough, if one telescopes both inquiries, initiation and waiver, into one, as the public defender would have us to do, it leaves nothing for the waiver issue to be decided under the separate Johnson versus Zerbst test, which this Court has set forward.</text>
