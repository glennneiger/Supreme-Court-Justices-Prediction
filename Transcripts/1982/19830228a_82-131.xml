            <label>Mr. Robert W. Murdoch</label>
            <text syncTime="63.209" offset="396519">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.380" offset="413237">This case is before you on a writ of certiorari from the Third Circuit Court of Appeals and presents two questions for your consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.814" offset="446987">The first question being the interpretation of some of the provisions under Section 905(a), 905(b), and 933 of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Worker's Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.075" offset="495993">The second question is a question regarding major damages which was applied by the lower court and affirmed by the Third Circuit in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.728" offset="530579">By way of background, the respondent was an employee of Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.411" offset="557329">He had worked for them on the rivers, particularly on the Monongahela River for Jones &amp; Laughlin for many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.237" offset="580630">He was entitled as having the duties of being a barge helper and barge handler.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.703" offset="610514">In doing so, he would go out and he would work with the barges.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.014" offset="623784">So that you are aware of the situation, on the Monongahela River Jones &amp; Laughlin had two landings.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.762" offset="646772">The first landing had an elevator which they would take these barges, and the barges being approximately 175 feet long, 26 feet wide, under the coal elevator.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.084" offset="700062">This would then empty the barge as the coal goes into the metal freeze, and persons like Mr. Pfeifer would then be in charge of taking care of the fleet as the empty barges would be moved down to the other fleet.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.344" offset="757113">Mr. Pfeifer was injured on February 13, 1978, at which time he came out to work on the midnight shift.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.701" offset="794520">He did not work his normal job at that time, his normal job was a Class 7 job, but as he would do from time to time, he would come out and he worked as a headman, this was a Class 13 as far as the pay is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.086" offset="852094">In that position Mr. Pfeifer was in charge of two other individuals and these three individuals on that particular shift would then go out and take care of the barges.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.458" offset="897547">By taking care of the barges, they would make sure that the lashings were tight.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.611" offset="914161">If it was necessary to pump out any barges which were taking on water, this was one of their duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.812" offset="934955">Also incumbent upon Mr. Pfeifer and the people he was working with was to make sure that the gunnels, which would be the walkways on the barges, and the deck-ends where the people would walk would be free and clear of snow.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.947" offset="991484">As I say, Mr. Pfeifer came out to work at midnight on this particular shift, and sometime later, 3:00 a.m., or 4:00 a.m., while going out with two other individuals to pump a barge, he slipped on some ice and snow that had been accumulated on the barge and injured his back.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.127" offset="1068179">As a result of that incident, then, Mr. Pfeifer did sign the proper forms for getting payments under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Worker's Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.451" offset="1109557">I think it is important for you to know as a Court that Jones &amp; Laughlin has been paying Mr. Pfeifer for the compensation benefits as called for under this Act ever since the date of the accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.806" offset="1154906">At the time of the trial in this particular case in which there was a final verdict rendered against Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corporation in the amount of approximately $275,000, there was a set off which was approximately $33,000 for the compensation benefits which had been made to Mr. Pfeifer as of the date of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.281" offset="1248842">I believe it is also important for you to know that even today as I stand here arguing this case before you, we are still making payments under the Compensation Act as called for.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.104" offset="1296071">I think this is relatively important because 905(a) of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Worker's Act sets forth what we refer to as the exclusivity provision, which states basically that a person injured under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Worker's Act has exclusive remedies to receive compensation from the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.392" offset="1389276">This is why I pointed out that under these circumstances we have been and in fact are still paying because as Jones &amp; Laughlin looks at and reviews the exclusivity provision, we feel that that is the only basis that an employee is to receive benefits from the employer.</text>

          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="330.634" stopTime="354.812">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="330.634" offset="1466285">That would be traditional in those workmen's compensation type claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.038" offset="1483840">But what do you do with the language of this Court in the Edmonds case which seems to have rejected your position, and in this limited situation would say that the ship owner is still liable both under the underlying tort claim and as under the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="374.912" offset="1643396">But it was a pretty clear statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.834" offset="1651023">Is there not legislation pending in Congress now that changed this precise--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_w_murdoch" startTime="382.722" stopTime="845.301">
            <label>Mr. Robert W. Murdoch</label>
            <text syncTime="382.722" offset="1674638">There is in the legislation history as it appears, although the amendments to the Longshoremen's and Harbor Worker's Act are still pending, they have set forth the case of Griffith versus Wheeling-Pittsburgh as being something that was not intended from the 1972 amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.996" offset="1743706">I will give you some background.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.262" offset="1748721">In 1972, there was an amendment by 905(b), which is the section that was discussed in Edmonds and came into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.883" offset="1787278">As I look at the Edmonds decision, as I look at the Griffith/Wheeling-Pittsburgh case, I feel that was done in that particular instance, though, was the failure to look at sections 905(a), 905(b), and section 933, as they are all read together.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.484" offset="1857600">Though This Court, even as recently as last Wednesday, set forth in the case of Lockheed versus the United States that 905(a) was the exclusive remedy under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Worker's Benefit Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.120" offset="1912143">As we look at 905(a), it simply says that this is the only thing that the employee is entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.055" offset="1939938">Getting to 905(b) and looking at the legislative intent of the amendments back in 1972, as we have in most workermen's compensation areas you had the quid pro quo.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.955" offset="1999497">You had the giving up of any rights that they might have had before the amendments to sue for unseaworthiness or to sue for indemnity in response for largely increased benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.231" offset="2048607">These benefits are taken under section 910 and they set forth that as of June 1st of each year the different values are placed on as to what the increase is going to be for the benefits, and then they are implemented in October of that particular year.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.224" offset="2132617">So the position that we have here is that because of the 1972 amendments giving such a large increase in benefits to these longshoremen that it did away with what was the dual capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.186" offset="2184444">I think it is important that you look at 905(b) as it applies to 905(a) and 933.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.887" offset="2211298">905(b) basically starts off by saying that any person injured under this particular Act has the benefits of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.196" offset="2248496">I stress that it says "any person" because in looking at the Edmonds case there is a distinction that the Court brought or the Court intended to bring up by saying that the first sentence only applies to a longshoreman.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.940" offset="2303458">I disagree with that because if you go one step further, it says in 905(b) if there is the right, then, to sue the vessel or vessel as a person that the employer cannot be directly or indirectly liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.713" offset="2374511">So where I have the problem with Edmonds is that it did not go far enough with the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.055" offset="2403977">You have 905(a) which basically says exclusively you get the benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.225" offset="2428636">The employer is not to suffer any more manner of making payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.644" offset="2446295">Section 905(b) reiterates this, it says that the employer cannot be directly or indirectly liable to the injured employee on behalf of the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.670" offset="2494360">If we look at Edmonds and we try to determine the way it was with Edmonds, then you are saying basically that the injured employee can sue the vessel, but in the same token if the vessel is owned by the employer it is literally the employer that is making the payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.835" offset="2567085">So it is really a way of getting around the language as far as what 905(a) was, and it is our contention that in 905(b), as the second part of the first sentence, where it says that the employer may not be directly or indirectly liable to the employee for the vessel, then they are in fact reiterating in 905(b) the exclusivity provision that it had in 908(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="635.510" offset="2685786">Going one step further in that same sentence in section 905(b) it does make reference that if any action can be filed by the injured employee, it would be in accordance with section 933 of the same Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.223" offset="2748584">Edmonds did not address itself to that particular section.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.440" offset="2765511">Section 933 of the Act sets forth that the injured employee, if he determines that the injuries were in fact caused by somebody other than the employer or an employee of the employer, he has the right to a third party action.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.776" offset="2830818">So I think you have in 905(a) and 905(b) and 933, you have three distinct places where the intent of Congress was to limit any payments that the injured employee would get from the employer to solely the situation of receiving the compensation benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.471" offset="2917544">The trade-offs, as I have indicated, if you look at the legislative intent and the language which I have cited in my brief, sets forth specifically that the intent of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Worker's Act was to place maritime workers in similar situations into the same situation that a land-based employee has under Workmen's Compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.211" offset="3012525">I believe the Court is well aware that in the cases where we have a State Workemen's Compensation law that the employee who is injured does in fact have the right to get the benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.816" offset="3058919">Under the Compensations Act, he had no other benefits at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.533" offset="3077831">There is nothing to preclude him, as I feel the intent of 905(b) was, to sue, let's say, the manufacturer of a machine upon which he was injured as long as it was not owned by the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.215" offset="3132584">So I think, in looking at the 1972 amendments, when you put them all together without taking them out of context, that you can see that the overall intent was simply to put these longshoremen on the same basis of land-based employees, to get only that type of benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.113" offset="3212205">Now, 905(b) does also provide that somebody who is injured, who is not an employee or not, can sue somebody who has caused the injury, but again if there is any liability or any money to be paid by the employer, then they are not going to receive payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.792" offset="3298827">We had raised this contention in the pleadings.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.197" offset="3312516">I had raised it as a motion for summary judgment in the lower court, and of course the Third Circuit looked at it, but this is the first time, I believe, that this issue has been before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.067" offset="3355983">Although there has been discussion in Edmonds and in other cases, I do feel that what we are looking at is a situation that the intent of Congress was overwhelming to limit the recovery that the longshoremen could get.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.890" offset="3419304">I might point out also that if we get this interpretation, and also we are looking at minimizing litigation costs, because I think if you look at the true intent then the employees who are injured will, in fact, be getting their compensation benefits which are quite high under the circumstances of this Act, and there is not going to be these types of actions which are going to take up the time of the trial courts largely.</text>

            <text syncTime="960.616" offset="3986161">If there are no other questions concerning that question, I will go on to the second question.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.738" offset="4018658">The second question was the standard of the measure of damages which was decided by the lower court and then affirmed by the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.280" offset="4064842">In 1980, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided the case of Kacskowski versus Bolubasc and in that particular case they had adopted what had been known as the Alaska Rule, which is basically the total offset method.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.990" offset="4151673">In the total offset method, the lower court assumed that any inflation which may arise in the future would be the equivalent and be offset of any interest rates, so that rather than discounting to the present value, that whatever the value of lost future earnings were going to be or the capacity of future earnings, that was what the measure was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.775" offset="4262850">In this particular case, as I stated before, the lower court came to the conclusion based on a worklife of 12 years that Mr. Pfeifer would have been making $26,000 for those 12 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.582" offset="4321991">In multiplying this there was a finding that Mr. Pfeifer could do some minimum wage, so that was projected over the worklife expectancy and that was deducted in addition to the workmen's or longshoremen's compensation benefits that we had paid as of the date of the jury... the non-jury verdict, that was deducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.354" offset="4413107">It is our position, as we told the lower court and put in our post-findings of fact, that it was going to be necessary... in the event that there was a verdict in favor of the plaintiff that there was going to have to be a reduction to present work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.332" offset="4477054">This was not done as it was just assumed, as I state, that the inflation was going to offset the interest rates and, therefore, whatever the figure determined at that time was was going to be what the plaintiff would get.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.623" offset="4538181">We submit to this honorable Court that this is a decision upon which there is really no basis to make this type of finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.774" offset="4586769">I think when we look at the purpose of determining why we give a lump sum award, it is because the lump sum award, if it is given directly to the plaintiff at the time of the trial, is going to be worth much more after investing than it would be by the reduction to present value, which is what this Court set the standard to be in 1916 in the case of Chesapeake versus Kelly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.824" offset="4711007">Also as recently as 1980 in the case of LIFECO there was the same reiteration that in order to arrive at a full value, a fair figure for impairment of future earnings or lost wages there must be a reduction of present worth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.723" offset="4786553">That was ignored by the Third Circuit and this is the only circuit which has adopted this measure of damages in a Federal action, and we submit that it should not be done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.700" offset="4842455">There have been many cases set forth in our brief, and also in the briefs of the Amicus which have filed on our behalf, setting forth the problems that even economists have with making a determination as to how to determine if in fact we are going to have inflation and be able to project inflation at a particular rate over a long time period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.096" offset="4956140">I think with that we have seen in the economy in the last three, four, five years with the spiraling inflation rates, with the governmental steps to come in and try to reduce inflation, with determining whether or not we are in a recession or a depression, with all the economic factors, the economists cannot even agree from past events what caused those.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.477" offset="5053629">It has been held almost uniformly, although there are some circuits which are making a distinction, that inflation is too speculative to have somebody come in and make a argument, give evidence to a fact-finder, to project over a long time period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.814" offset="5123010">What we are suggesting is that the proper measure of damages would be to get back to what we still call the traditional approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.793" offset="5162925">The traditional approach being that there can be evidence of a particular category of individuals in a particular geographical area, and there can be testimony of somebody to come in as an economist to set forth that there would be a likelihood of increased wages, but not to get into the convoluted type of testimony that we have with inflation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1322.703" offset="5434494">Then after they get the total award, they go through the mechanics of reducing it to present value.</text>

            <text syncTime="1331.341" offset="5469080">We think this is the most fair because, I think as litigators and being in and out of courts, one of the things we want to do is to try to get the type of testimony which is not going to be convoluted, which is not going to increase the time of trial, the cost of trial, and also put it on the basis that some fact-finders or jurors can then make a decision as to what they should give a person who is injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.969" offset="5587572">I think this is fair because one of the things that we strive to do in courts is to make it a system that is fair not only for the defendants but for the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.309" offset="5632920">The history has shown that any increase in inflation has not kept up with any increase as far as interest rates are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.616" offset="5670119">You have problems if you project, such as in Kaczkowski, the inflation, basically the inflation, because you are going to assume then that even the increases of salary are going to keep up with rates of inflation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.970" offset="5735634">I think that the past history has shown in the cases that we have cited, and that the Amici have cited, that this just is not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.717" offset="5770534">What I am suggesting, as I said, we want to preclude the introduction of speculation which is basically, as I say, convoluted, reduce it to present worth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.572" offset="5817972">You have a built-in factor there that if interest rates are going to increase that the increase, then, from the interest rates can be reinvested and this would also benefit the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.457" offset="5873560">So I am not looking at a situation where we are trying to cut down as far as what the plaintiff is going to get, but to make it something that is workable for the court system, fair to both parties, and still something that can cut down on the litigation costs.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jerome M. Libenson</label>
            <text syncTime="1798.231" offset="7336627">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.944" offset="7399529">There are two issues in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.427" offset="7409456">The first is whether a longshoreman may sue his employer for negligence as a vessel owner under 905(b) of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Worker's Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.563" offset="7449998">I will refer to this as the Act as I go through my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.109" offset="7464104">The second is whether the lower court properly calculated damages on the record before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.669" offset="7490331">Both these issues were affirmed in the lower court in favor of my client, the Respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.916" offset="7515409">The Longshoremen's and Harbor Worker's Compensation Act was passed in 1927, but it was significantly amended in 1972 to add 905(b) for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.066" offset="7571938">905(b) put into statutory form permission to bring an action against a vessel as a third party in negligence instead of unseaworthiness which was the previous method of claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.653" offset="7642364">As Justice O'Connor pointed out, the Petitioner, J&amp;L's negligence in its ownership capacity is not before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.572" offset="7690011">Furthermore, J&amp;L admitted that it was owner pro hac vice of all the barges in the fleet on January 13, 1978, when Howard Pfeifer was injured, when he slipped on an accumulation of snow and ice on a gunnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.844" offset="7763049">I don't know if the Court is familiar with how barges are assembled on the Allegheny River.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.999" offset="7783738">These are coal barges and they are assembled and lashed together in what they call a fleet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.872" offset="7811219">The barges are moved in or out of the fleet to unload or load coal to the steel mill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.525" offset="7837760">The point is that of the 35 barges that were there that night or 40 barges, the ownership of those were all J&amp;L's under the pro hac vice theory, whether or not they actually did own them or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.894" offset="7891258">However, J&amp;L would have you treat this case differently if my client fell on an unowned barge in the same fleet, which is contrary to the intent of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.997" offset="7955729">Under 905(b) all longshoremen are to be treated the same, and there should be no difference whether the vessel is employer-owned or third party-owned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.164" offset="8008391">The fact is that the employer assumes a dual capacity as all Circuit Courts have found of ownership of the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.363" offset="8045172">They don't have to do this, but when they do it, the Act applies to them as it would apply to any other vessel owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.109" offset="8072130">The incidence of their being an employer of the person who is injured is incidental to the fact of their ownership of the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.184" offset="8108493">I submit to you that the award in this case should not depend on the gratuitous event or happenstance of how or where a person happens to fall if he is going to be injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.771" offset="8186756">The 1972 amendments to this Act were brought about because of this Court's finding in Seas Shipping against Sieracki and in the Lyon case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.529" offset="8257809">During the period between 1927 and 1972, the practice was for a vessel to ask for an indemnity agreement from any stevedore company, and the effect was that any injury or claim against the vessel under unseaworthiness was paid finally by the stevedore company under the indemnity agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.363" offset="8349133">Congress felt that this was improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.534" offset="8357805">In passing the amendments in 1972, it took away the unseaworthiness doctrine, the indemnity provisions, and it expanded the Act by increasing the benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.403" offset="8421335">But it also in effect ratified Reed against The Yakka and Jackson which this Court had passed, and permitted a suit against the vessel itself under 905(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.302" offset="8484865">This Court in Edmonds, speaking through Justice White, considered 905(b) and stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.624" offset="8546200">"To permit a third party suit against the vessel providing its own loading and unloading services where negligence and its stevedoring capacity contributes to the injury. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.917" offset="8583399">The second sentence means no more than that all longshoremen are to be treated the same, whether their employer is an independent stevedore or a shipowner stevedore.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.086" offset="8620075">All stevedores are to be treated the same whether they are independent or an arm of the shipowner itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.130" offset="8644212">Justice White further cited the congressional hearing reports and stated in footnote 12 in his opinion that</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.907" offset="8687366">"Congress ultimately decided to preserve the longshoremen's tort action against shipowners acting as shipowners. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.889" offset="8711294">The legislative goal of passing 905(b) was the safety of the longshoremen, and the committee reports say that</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.318" offset="8784960">"The Committee recognized the progress that has been made in reducing injury in the longshoring industry, but longshoring remains one of the most hazardous types of occupation, and the Committee expects to see further progress in reducing injuries and stands ready to immediately reexamine the third party question. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.593" offset="8862073">The point is that Congress felt that by preserving the action against the vessel, it would have a salutary effect on the vessels to ensure their safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.290" offset="8904914">There are six Circuit courts that have addressed this question since the 1972 amendments have been in effect, and all of them have arrived at a finding that is in conformity with Griffith and the results in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.064" offset="8984013">I believe that this Court, speaking through Justice Powell in Pfeifer, stated that this was a remedial statute, and the amendments were made out of solicitude for the workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.622" offset="9034168">Justice O'Connor very recently, since the filing of our brief, in Director against Perrini, cited the committee reports for authority as to what the Act meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.258" offset="9076695">I think if this Court will again refer to the Act and committee reports, they should have no problem with 905(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.285" offset="9116819">Congress's intent was to treat all longshoremen alike, whether employed by an independent stevedore or shipowner stevedore and to impose liability on shipowner stevedores for negligence in their ownership capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.717" offset="9170527">This comports with the legislative intent of encouraging safety on vessel and holding an employer/owner to the same standards as any other shipowner when acting in its shipowner capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.401" offset="9217338">To deny Pfeifer's recovery due to the mere happenstance of his being injured on an employer-owned or pro hac vice vessel would be grossly unfair and contrary to the legislative intent, and to circuit cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.925" offset="9271360">It would remove any incentive to shipowner/employers to exercise due care in their ownership capacity in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.283" offset="9296855">I would also point out to this Court that there is no double recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.688" offset="9314409">As Justice Stevens asked and was advised, the award in this case is deducted from the... the compensation in this case is deducted from the award, so there is no double recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.354" offset="9369162">The employer is repaid any payments it makes under the compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.758" offset="9382746">Jones &amp; Laughlin undertook ownership responsibilities and failed to live up to its responsibilities and it must, therefore, be held liable in negligence for the injuries to my client under 905(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.379" offset="9429244">The question of damages and the proper method of determining damages is also before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.235" offset="9468636">First of all, I would point to the Court, as Justice Stevens has asked, there is a complete waiver on the part of the petitioner to raise this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.637" offset="9518269">The local rules of the District Court in which this was tried require any expert testimony to be proffered in the pretrial statement with a report from the expert, and before an expert is permitted to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.036" offset="9575843">There was no report filed by the petitioner nor any evidence offered on his behalf.</text>

            <text syncTime="2930.508" offset="11865737">Then there is the total offset method.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.024" offset="11871797">All four wrestle with the same problem as to what is the method, but I think they illustrate that any one method is just not exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.579" offset="11945985">I think that this Court, if it attempted to say that there is one method that is superior to the others, would only run into additional problems on other aspects of damages that would not hold water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.493" offset="12013694">The only question that the Third Circuit really answered in its opinion was that they held that the District Court did not err in computing damages for future loss of earnings... this is on 16a of the petition for certiorari... because it is not necessary to go through the process of discounting lump sum awards at theoretical present values.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.935" offset="12127484">The discount factor is presumed equal to the offset by the impact of inflation on the future economic value of the award.</text>

            <text syncTime="3473.367" offset="14037139">I would like to cover several points which were raised in Mr. Libenson's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.146" offset="14056261">I would respectfully disagree that by having the amendments of 1972 that the Reed versus The Yakka case was overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.923" offset="14095445">I feel that if in my interpretation, putting 905(a), 905(b), and 933 together, would indicate again, without getting back into my argument, that all actions against a vessel or an employer are completely devoid due to these amendments and, therefore, I feel the negligence actions which are allowed under 905(b) are for a longshoreman or anyone covered under the Act against somebody other than the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.613" offset="14226161">As to the payments that come under the workmen's compensation benefits, such as we have in this case, I believe that one of the intents, one of the purposes that we have in the workmen's compensation statute was to provide regular payments to the individual who was injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.840" offset="14299095">We have two dangers if this type of action is allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.681" offset="14322396">First of all, it requires a lump sum payment, which is going to be paid with the stopping of the compensation payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.787" offset="14354893">There is no guarantee that anybody who receives a lump sum payment such as this is going to retain it or have the wise investment opportunities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.329" offset="14400973">So I think that it is something that should be considered, with the purpose to allow the monetary benefits on a regular basis, that these types of actions go against that particular intent.</text>

            <text syncTime="3580.917" offset="14467324">As to the total offset method, I would like to raise something as an example in order to show exactly what we are involved with with the total offset method.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.631" offset="14510269">If we assume that the finding of the Court would be that the lost earning capacity in the future would be $180,000 for that particular plaintiff, what the total offset method does is provide $180,000 in that individual's pocket at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.169" offset="14592398">It allows him to invest at the rates, to reinvest at higher rates, so that assuming that he had ten years of lost productivity, he gets $180,000 plus all the total interest over that time period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.757" offset="14646733">That is not what we are attempting to do when we are determining what amount of money is due to an injured individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.566" offset="14681946">We are determining that if he, in fact, is going to lose $180,000 over his worklife expectancy, that by reducing to the present value that in the ninth and tenth year in my example of his worklife expectancy, he is going to receive exactly what he would have received had he been continuing to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.057" offset="14767941">The total offset method does not do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.338" offset="14777031">It goes completely against the grain to the prejudice of the Defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.978" offset="14795631">Also I would like to point out that under section 905(a) and 905(b) that it is almost a strict liability situation as far as the employer is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3675.097" offset="14844114">We are required as employers to make these payments whether there is negligence, non-negligence, or anything like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.423" offset="14869400">I think that this should be taken into consideration.</text>
