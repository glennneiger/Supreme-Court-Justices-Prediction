            <label>Mr. Paul P. Biebel, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="5.904" offset="195103">Thank you very much, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.737" offset="202417">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.141" offset="219971">This case was originally argued before this Court on October 13, 1982, and the question of the applicability of the Aguilar-Spinelli standard to this case where an anonymous letter was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.381" offset="272948">However, on November 29, 1982, this case was restored to the calendar for reargument to consider the additional question: whether the exclusionary rule as enunciated in Mapp and Weeks should to any extent be modified so, for example, not to require the exclusion of evidence obtained in the reasonable belief that the search and seizure was consistent with the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.301" offset="384647">We are back before the Court today to consider this additional important issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.872" offset="410874">Before I started my argument I would simply like to indicate that our argument in a nut shell is this:</text>
            <text syncTime="68.410" offset="445042">Determinations of probable cause are practical, factual judgments of probability.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.964" offset="475344">It is the function of the magistrate or the judge to make decisions prior to a search.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.368" offset="500944">Because of the factual nature of this determination, because of the respect for the magistrate's function in this regard, and because of society's interest in avoiding the exclusionary rule's harsh costs, these determinations should be given great deference on motions to suppress.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.532" offset="581610">Evidence should not be excluded if any reasonable person could have concluded that there was probable cause on the basis of the totality of the circumstances and judged by the practical and factual considerations of everyday life.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.308" offset="636677">In short, if there's a reasonable basis for the finding of probable cause the exclusionary rules should not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.029" offset="663530">Any analysis of the exclusionary rule, we believe, must consider the context in which the exclusionary rule was born.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.766" offset="694459">Around the turn of the century there was a great concern about flagrant and egregious police misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.437" offset="717134">In cases like Weeks in 1914 and Silverthorne Lumber Company in 1920, you had situations where persons were arrested and while they were in custody the police went to their homes or went to their businesses and searched without probable cause of any sort and without warrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.798" offset="790590">And obtained through their appropriated papers and effects evidence that was used against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.118" offset="811906">In Rochin versus California in 1952, this Court's conscience was shocked when the police took Mr. Rochin to the hospital and had his stomach pumped in order to obtain the morphine capsules which he had swallowed after the police had forced their way into his house without a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.263" offset="888497">And, finally, in Mapp versus Ohio in 1961 which reversed Wolf versus Colorado, of course, and applied the exclusionary rule to the states, you had a situation where the police attempted to enter Mrs. Mapp's house with her consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.755" offset="946489">Upon the advice of her attorney she refused that consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.041" offset="959550">The police a few hours later forced their way into the house, searched the entire premises and found four pamphlets and a few photographs, all allegedly pornographic.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.682" offset="1006152">Each of these cases which ultimately led up to Weeks... lead up to Mapp, involved flagrant acts of police misconduct for which this Court indicated the exclusionary rule ought to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.490" offset="1057352">But the exclusionary rule which was meant to deter such serious misconduct by police has come to mean much more as it's been applied by trial courts and review in courts around this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.213" offset="1108239">The new rule... the rule now applies to evidence... to exclude evidence at trial no matter what the error, large or small, committed by police and by magistrates.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.057" offset="1159648">Now, if the primary intent of the exclusionary rule is meant to deter police misconduct... and this Court has said that on may occasions starting with Elkins in 1960... then the world simply does not work in a situation as here where it's hard to see what the police did wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.769" offset="1234463">We argued in our initial briefs that we didn't believe the Aguilar-Spinelli two-prong test even if applicable to our case was violated because of the extensive corroboration of the letter and because of the determination of probable cause made by Judge Lewis when he issued the search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.730" offset="1306352">But even if this Court were to find that the Aguilar-Spinelli test was violated, we would nevertheless contend that in this instance the exclusionary rule should not be applied because the anonymous letter coupled with ample corroboration amounted to probable cause under the definition as historically enunciated by this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="331.127" offset="1495896">We were focusing in on Aguilar-Spinelli but in a sense we were focusing in an indirect fashion on the consideration of probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.983" offset="1531318">What we are doing in our approach today is looking at that probable cause aspect of this case in a closer way.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul P. Biebel, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="379.308" offset="1688680">Long before Mapp, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.977" offset="1695367">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.494" offset="1697457">But, this Court has defined that rule in People versus Demorrow in 1974 to follow the standards enunciated by the Supreme Court of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.701" offset="1738208">The analysis that was made in this case, as a matter of fact, in the Aguilar-Spinelli issue, took into consideration the federal guidelines that took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.771" offset="1770495">So, Illinois does track the Federal Fourth Amendement law with regard to the exclusionary rule and follow... has followed it closely.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.425" offset="1797140">We believe that that is consistent with whatever the Court would do today.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.346" offset="1816784">There's no doubt that the law of search and seizure has become complicated and confusing.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.535" offset="1849594">And one of the more confusing areas involves the application of the Aguilar-Spinelli standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.256" offset="1868507">Professor Lafate has 140 pages in his treatise on hearsay evidence with regard to this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.493" offset="1893375">Because it was confusing we have cases like People versus Bell where a district court held that the affidavit with regard to an eyewitness identification didn't support the credibility and reliability of that eyewitness in case... and consequently that evidence was suppressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.471" offset="1973310">The Fifth Circuit said that's simply wrong, that Aguilar-Spinelli ought to be limited to informant situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.275" offset="1996507">In our case, too, we have an obvious confusion with regard to Aguilar-Spinelli because both the police and the judge felt that the letter could be utilized in order to determine whether probable cause exists or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.285" offset="2048543">To hold in this case that the exclusionary rule applies where the police made a diligent and a reasonable effort to fulfill their responsibilities is in effect to place form over substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.342" offset="2092846">The essence and the analysis of whether the search warrant should issue is whether or not there's probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.413" offset="2117088">All three Illinois Courts considering this issue talked in terms of probable cause but they analyzed it in light of the two-pronged Aguilar-Spinelli test which we discussed the last time we were before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.869" offset="2162959">However, we suggest in this case that this Court ought to consider stating affirmatively that they're going to return to the unadorned probable cause standard which was enunciated in Carroll and in Brinegar.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.195" offset="2216249">In Brinegar, this Court stated that when you're dealing with probable cause you're dealing with probabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.015" offset="2239446">These are not technical considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.317" offset="2248745">They are factual and practical concerns of everyday life in which reasonable and prudent men, and not legal technicians, act.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.573" offset="2281764">Put in another light, this concept of probable cause merely requires an objectively reasonable assessment that it's more probable than not that the search warrant covered evidence of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.846" offset="2326799">This basic probable cause standard is a realization that police and magistrates deal in factual contexts in which they simply don't have all the answers, but nevertheless may be required to act if they believe there's probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.157" offset="2392105">Mr. Justice White put it well in his dissent in Stone versus Powell where he said, making arrests in circumstances in which the police officer feels he has probable cause is precisely what the community expects of him.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.448" offset="2445186">Neither police officers nor judges issuing warrants need delay until unquestioned proof is accumulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.887" offset="2470995">The officer may be shirking his duty if he does so.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.606" offset="2485832">That same philosophy has been reiterated in Draper where this Court said the police would be derelict in their duty if they didn't follow up on leads.</text>

            <text syncTime="601.621" offset="2577888">And we feel that the Draper analysis, which is consistent with the Carroll-Brinegar analysis which takes into consideration the totality of the circumstances, really what we're talking about today you've got to look at the whole picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.612" offset="2625849">We think that Draper amply supports our position in this case as to the analysis to be used.</text>

            <text syncTime="859.106" offset="3607844">It was prior to Schimel, and, consequently, was a proper search.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.891" offset="3619024">And, they found evidence indicative of the guilt of Hill.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.276" offset="3632504">This Court said that even though there had been a mistake as to who had been arrested there was nevertheless probable cause because the police reasonably believed that the man arrested was Hill.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.818" offset="3674717">The Court cited Brinegar's standard, and, said that what we're looking at here is a factual and practical rather than a legal technical view... legally technical view, and, consequently, that mistake shouldn't make any difference in the finding of probable cause which is actually the determination of probabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.529" offset="3745561">Because this is a practical consideration, the issuance of a warrant is entitled to great deference as this Court has stated in cases such as Jones and Ventresca.</text>

            <text syncTime="992.490" offset="4141369">And many cases, I might add, involved this exact question on motions to suppress, was the evidence sufficient to show probable cause.</text>

            <text syncTime="1020.676" offset="4254113">If that's the case, then, a lot of these aberrant decisions which have come down in the search and seizure area I think would be changed if those considerations were made in light of the standard we're asking the Court to enunciate in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1036.952" offset="4319210">The standard in criminal cases is not whether the reviewing Court feels that the defendant is proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, but, rather where there was substantial evidence to show that as this Court pointed out in Woodby versus the Immigration and Naturalization Service in 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.997" offset="4387442">And, in 1979, this was reiterated in Jackson versus Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.384" offset="4404997">Mr. Justice Stewert issued the opinion in that case in somewhat different language where he said, the issue was whether any rational trier of fact could have determined guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.359" offset="4452853">Using that basic philosophy of deference for the factfinder, we apply that to this case involving probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.846" offset="4482841">This Court said, for example, in Jones versus United States in 1960 that the standard of review with regard to probable cause is whether there is a substantial basis to believe that the narcotics were probably present in the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.788" offset="4538639">Now, by using the substantial or reasonable or rational basis the focus becomes not what the reviewing judge thought, but what a reasonable, a rational police officer or magistrate could have believed when he made the determination of probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.102" offset="4619828">And if that determination is probable, it ought to be respected by the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1344.233" offset="5548324">They had an agent at the other end of the trip, waiting, observing Gates get off.</text>

            <text syncTime="1352.506" offset="5581447">And went to a room where a woman was registered in his wife's name, which proved out was Susan Gates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.827" offset="5602763">They observed that he stayed in Florida for about ten or ten and a half hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.862" offset="5622930">And there's no evidence he left the motel at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.581" offset="5633797">And then drove back on the interstate to Chicago, presumably toward Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.218" offset="5652291">The police went on the basis of that information which was all consistent with the letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.038" offset="5675592">And all done over a day and a half or a two-day stretch and asked a judge to issue a warrant on the basis of probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.477" offset="5713313">The judge said that he felt there was probable cause in this case and issued a warrant for both the car and for the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.881" offset="5738913">This is clearly not the kind of activity the exclusionary rule is meant to deter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.952" offset="5763259">This was thorough professional police work over a day and a half or two-day period involving three police agencies, the Illinois Secretary of State, the phone company and a confidential informant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.860" offset="5810907">The the imposition of the exclusionary rule in this case for purely technical reasons would deter police officers, it seems to us, from doing their job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.131" offset="5851971">And, certainly deter police officers from going to get warrants because if the warrant is not going to be given the kind of respect that this Court said it should have from Jones and Ventresca, then the warrant process is really meaningless from the point of view of the police officer and under those circumstances he may resort to warrantless searches which, of course, we... this Court has frowned upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.147" offset="5944027">We think that there is a problem with the probable cause standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.420" offset="5973075">The courts have issued aberrant opinions in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.954" offset="5987286">They have used artificial standards, Aguilar-Spinelli, whatever, they used artificial standards in this regard.</text>

            <text syncTime="1505.923" offset="6195116">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.993" offset="6219357">This Court's question as stated in its order of November 29, is keyed to the officers' reasonable belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.615" offset="6265855">As so stated the question has been answered by this Court's precedents which make it quite clear that the exclusionary rule necessarily applies only where, and, I'm quoting from Michigan versus Tucker, the police have engaged in willful or at the very least negligent conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.262" offset="6344536">It is elementary law that the willful and the negligent occupy different parts of the legal and behavorial universe from that which is reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.820" offset="6390721">So that by very definition the question has been answered by this Court's decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.640" offset="6414022">The conduct of a law enforcement officer in Weeks and Mapp as Mr. Biebel has told us was flagrantly abusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.711" offset="6442234">It was intentional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.829" offset="6446727">Because it was intentional it was susceptible of being deterred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.483" offset="6469401">The present case is at the opposite end of the spectrum from Weeks and Mapp.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.720" offset="6494270">The police officers' conduct in this case was not flagrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.339" offset="6508794">It was not intentional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.957" offset="6515272">It is the kind of conduct which even if technically violative of the Fourth Amendment involves only disagreements among judges over subtle and elusive issues of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.099" offset="6571801">This is simply not the kind of case to which the exclusionary rule was intended to apply or which achieves its deterrence objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.304" offset="6608686">And under those circumstances this case is controlled by a firmly established principle, established by this Court in a consistent line of decisions reaching back for at least fourteen years which teaches that since the paramount and probably the sole purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter unlawful police conduct, the rule applies only to those situations where its deterrence benefits outweigh the costs of suppressing highly probative evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.109" offset="6735850">This Court's precedents reject the notion that the exclusionary rule applies to any violation of the Fourth Amendment or that it must be applied whenever there is any possibility of deterrence however slight.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.416" offset="6785065">The answer, the Court said in Stone versus Powell, is to be found by weighing the utility of the exclusionary rule against the costs of extending it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1812.636" offset="7421930">One is that the principal focus should be on the conduct of the police rather than on the conduct of the magistrate for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.424" offset="7457144">The first is that insofar as deterrence is concerned this Court's decisions have made it rather clear that it is the police officers with whose conduct we are to be concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.501" offset="7513464">On the assumption--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="1837.184" stopTime="1844.107">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="1837.184" offset="7520151">So there is a secondary interest in making sure the government itself isn't involved in wrongdoing.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="1844.107" stopTime="2063.061">
            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="1844.107" offset="7547841">--That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.423" offset="7549095">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.823" offset="7550766">And for that reason as we set forth in our brief, we hold open the possibility that in some future case there could be conduct in which it... not only the conduct of the police, but also that of the magistrate might be taken into account in determining whether the totality of governmental conduct, both police and magistrates, might result in the modification which we urge not being applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.744" offset="7682424">But those would be unusual circumstances for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.129" offset="7703948">On the assumption which underlies necessarily the exclusionary rule that there is a linkage between the deterrence of the police and the unavailability of the use of the evidence at the trial, there is at least a logical linkage because the police are part of, in one view, the overall law enforcement effort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.513" offset="7805512">The linkage is much more loose and indeed there is some question as to whether it even exists when you focus not on the law enforcement officer but rather on the magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.206" offset="7868311">The magistrate's responsibility is not to convict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.010" offset="7883462">The magistrate's responsibility is... he is not part of the overall law enforcement process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.831" offset="7910734">Rather his responsibility improves the accommodation of both society's interests and also the individual's interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.567" offset="7937692">And as a consequence, it simply is not true that the deterrence of the magistrate fits in the same category as does deterrence of the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.089" offset="7983772">I'd like now to turn to the application of this Court's truth suppression balancing against deterrence of improper police conduct to the facts in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.135" offset="8043958">First of all on the cost side, Mr. and Mrs. Gates were indicted on the charge of possession of marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.455" offset="8073215">Illinois has some evidence in its possession that is rather relevant to whether they are guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.709" offset="8102264">The Illinois police in executing the search warrant found 350 pounds of marijuana in the Gates' trunk and more incriminating evidence in their home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.166" offset="8140089">The only question is whether this highly relevant and probative evidence is to be kept from the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.420" offset="8169137">Surely judicial integrity suffers serious damage when facts known to the judge, the lawyers on both sides and to the defendant are withheld solely from the only participants in the courtroom who need it the most.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.282" offset="8240608">On the deterrent side of the scale assuming arguendo that the drugs and other items were received in violations of the Fourth Amendment, it is difficult to perceive any adequate deterrent effect on future police misconduct from suppressing this evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.993" offset="8311452">The reason is that the police did in this case exactly what any reasonable police officers should do, what our society wants them to do and what this Court has said on many occasions that they should do wherever possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.420" offset="8373101">They obtained a search warrant so that the probable cause judgment is made by one whose governmental obligation includes the protection of the constitutional rights of the individual.</text>

            <text syncTime="2114.910" offset="8631086">That kind of obligation to steer between the scylla of his law enforcement obligation and the charybdis of the Fourth Amendment is probably unavoidable.</text>

            <text syncTime="2551.137" offset="10375961">--I think that's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.421" offset="10381081">There will be other opportunities for this Court to decide Fourth Amendment cases even if it should rule and in this case as... as in our view the Court should.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.349" offset="10448791">In the first place there are alleged Fourth Amendment violations involving a pan of practice of official conduct can often be challenged in a civil suit or declaratorium injunctive release.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.590" offset="10497797">For example, in Torres versus Puerto Rico in which this Court held unconstitutional a Puerto Rican statute making it... authorizing police to search the luggage of any person arriving in Puerto Rico from the United States could have been resolved in an action for declaratory judgment relief by a regular traveler to Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.170" offset="10580135">Similarly under section 1983, suits can be dropped against municipalities for constitutional torts resulting from implementation of local ordinances, regulations, policies, or even customary practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.763" offset="10638440">In addition, there is at least some likelihood that some states would decline as a matter of state law to adopt a reasonable belief modification to their own state exclusionary rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.971" offset="10683370">And the ruling of the courts of those states on underlying Fourth Amendment issues could be reviewed by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.041" offset="10707612">And, finally even in the prosecutions themselves, we see no credential or constitutional impediment to the courts deciding the substantive issue rather than going immediately to the remedial issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.087" offset="10775739">We would call in this respect to the Court's attention the case of O'Connor versus Donaldson which is not cited in our brief, 422 U.S. 563, in which the Court did exactly that in a civil damage suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.762" offset="10834463">It reached the constitutional issue first, and then remanded for determination whether there was a good faith immunity defense available to the defendant under the circumstances of that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.189" offset="10892141">Closing, within a fairly short time after Mapp versus Ohio came down and consistently ever since then the Court has consistently identified instances in which the exclusionary rule does not apply because its truth seeking costs out weigh its deterrence benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.785" offset="10982525">Those individual holdings have been sufficient in number and sufficient in their consistency that it is now apparent that they constitute more than just parts of a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.362" offset="11036859">That there is, in addition, a whole principle itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.064" offset="11051697">It remains only to declare the existence of that principle which is clearly applicable to this case where the action of the police officers was reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.455" offset="11093284">Under those circumstances the judgment of the Illinois Supreme Court should be reversed and the case remanded to that Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2776.432" offset="11277186">--I believe that at that time the issued was not raised, Mr. Chief Justice, therefore, it was kind of not... unnecessary for the Court to even mention something that was so obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.519" offset="11309473">The statute that I referred to was adopted twenty years ago and is included in the appendix to our original brief, Appendix 1A, and incorporated by reference into our brief on reargument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.976" offset="11355344">If I may briefly read the pertinent parts of that statute to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.963" offset="11371331">It is entitled, Motion to Suppress Evidence Illegally Seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.099" offset="11387841">And it reads briefly as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.015" offset="11395468">A defendant aggrieved by an unlawful search and seizure may move the Court to suppress as evidence anything so obtained on the ground that the search and seizure with a warrant was illegal, because the warrant is insufficient on its face or there was not probable cause for the issuance of the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.744" offset="11466417">It goes further and substantively states if the motion is granted the property shall not be admissable in evidence against the movant at any trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.182" offset="11500167">There is a further part of that statute which requires the motion to be made only before a court with jurisdiction to try the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.038" offset="11535589">In Illinois, that would be a full circuit court judge in a felony situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.990" offset="11551367">And it requires further that the judge who enters the order make findings of fact and conclusions of law so that the order and judgment may be reviewed by a higher court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.198" offset="11592223">Based upon the statute, the trial courts in Illinois must test the facial sufficiency of search warrants against a probable cause standard and nothing less.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.839" offset="11638825">The statute allows in a brief party to make a motion contesting a warrant's validity to a trial court in an adversary setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.909" offset="11667037">It commands that if the motion is granted that the evidence shall not be admissable against the defendant at a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.497" offset="11693473">The Illinois appellant courts in construing this statute have viewed it as giving a defendant the right to move the court to suppress unlawfully seized evidence and recognizes this statute as the basis for pre-trial motions to suppress in Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.025" offset="11755540">The case that indicates that is in an appellant court opinion, People versus Lebon, at 299 Northeast 2nd 336.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.696" offset="11786260">The Illinois Supreme Court, in the opinion by Justice Schafer, has recognized this statute as the codification of the exclusionary rule first announced in People versus Brocamp which was mentioned by I believe Mr. Biebel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.986" offset="11835370">The decision of the Illinois Supreme Court in 1923, nine years after Weeks and forty years before Mapp and as such is the statutory exclusionary rule in Illinois as was indicated in Brocamp.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.746" offset="11886466">That case was People versus Vanderalston at 349 Northeast 2nd, page 16, a 1976 opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.269" offset="11920530">The Illinois appellant courts in construing this statute have stated that this statute necessarily implies that the hearing judge has the authority to overturn the finding of the issuing judge on the probable cause question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.826" offset="11974760">That case indicating that is People v. Martin which is cited in our original brief on page 25.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.413" offset="12001091">There's a substantial quote from Martin in that particular page.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.717" offset="12018332">And that such a review over the issuing judge's decision to issue the warrant is necessarily proper and necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.871" offset="12046962">A case construing that is People v. Tatman in 1980, again an appellant court decision of 406 Northeast 2nd, page 619.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.346" offset="12084788">Further, on reviewing a trial court's ruling on a motion to suppress illegally seized evidence the appellant court now reviewing the trial court's determination has a duty to affirm the trial court's decision unless the decision is manifestly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.605" offset="12149885">That decision is People v. Smithers at 394 Northeast 2nd, 590, in 1979, Illinois public case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.478" offset="12185307">Petitioner urges this Court to adopt the standard such that if the issuing magistrate made a mistake in his determination of probable cause, the evidence seized pursuant to the warrant should nevertheless be admissable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.238" offset="12240373">Petitioner is thus requesting this Court, not the Illinois Supreme Court when they argued there, to ignore the Illinois Constitution, to ignore the Illinois Statute and to ignore the Illinois Supreme Court's opinion in Brocamp 60 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.147" offset="12300037">Further, petitioner's suggestion that search warrants deficient on their face should not be overturned flies in the face of this Court's language in Franks v. Delaware in dealing with the ex parte nature of the warrant process itself this Court and the dissent even indicated that it makes a good deal of sense to review search warrants issued by magistrates because of the ex parte nature and also because of Chadwick v. City of Tampa.</text>

            <label>Mr. James W. Reilley</label>
            <text syncTime="3071.772" offset="12458548">I think a police officer has no choice once the warrant is issued because the warrant's language commands that the officer shall search the person and place named.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.996" offset="12499403">I don't believe he has any discretion at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.496" offset="12509434">If he feels the warrant's invalid his feeling is irrelevant at that point since the magistrate already signed it and he is, as a matter of fact, obligated, I believe, to follow the signature of that search warrant because it commands him to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.189" offset="12564187">Prior to, as I indicated earlier... prior to the adoption of the statutory exclusionary rule in Illinois the Supreme Court adopted the exclusionary rule nine years after Weeks in Brocamp, again which is cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.115" offset="12627926">The Brocamp decision was followed by many others including Peoples v. Castree which is cited in this Court's appendix in the Elkins decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.573" offset="12665751">At that time there was a reference to cases that states that excluded and did not exclude evidence both before and after Wolf and before and after Weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.179" offset="12704203">Because of the Illinois exclusionary rules independent and prior existence to this Court's decision in Mapp v. Ohio, the question of whether the federal exclusionary rule should to any extent be modified in this case makes any such decision advisory because such a decision would have no effect on the statutorily and judicially mandated requirement in the State of Illinois that evidence seized without probable cause be excluded based upon the constitutional language which tracks the Fourth Amendment, the statutory language and the decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.000" offset="12839413">In summary, any modification of the rule can have no effect on the Illinois constitutionally judicially declared and legislatively enacted exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.743" offset="12890404">This Court in Cooper v. California made the statement which I feel is appropriate with regard to this state ground argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.314" offset="12920706">A decision by this Court, of course, does not affect the state's power to impose higher standards on searches and seizures than required by the Federal Constitution if it chooses to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.037" offset="12963547">Considering this jurisdictional question, I also urge the Court to read that portion of the brief submitted by the State Public Defender of California and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers dealing with 28 United States code 1257, certiorari jurisdiction only to the extent that the language indicates that the Court will entertain a question over the rights or privileges which are specially set up in a state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.224" offset="13084337">It's the respondent's contention that the State of Illinois never raised this question at any level in the state proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.227" offset="13112340">That the State of Illinois is or should be aware of the fact that there has been an exclusionary rule in the State of Illinois for 60 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.000" offset="13139403">That a judge has no choice if he finds no probable cause, under the law of the State of Illinois he must suppress the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.387" offset="13168974">There is no good faith or reasonable belief exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.922" offset="13179109">The statute is very clear on its face and we believe, the respondents believe, that the statute controls in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.426" offset="13205127">The petitioner's brief tells this Court, as I believe counsel indicated, that they're not asking for a good faith exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.151" offset="13252043">They agree that the exclusionary rule should apply if the mistake is a question of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.387" offset="13277016">I think there is no doubt about the fact that the determination of the existence or not of probable cause is a question of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.227" offset="13308363">Certainly, it may be a mixture in that you have to look at facts, you have to look sometimes at hearsay declarations, but all in all the determination of the existence or not of probable cause is a question of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.368" offset="13356951">So therefore, under counsel's own statement in his brief, if that is true then the exclusionary rule should apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.224" offset="13388298">Counsel indicates that he believes that the exclusionary rule or the question of probable cause is a question of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.211" offset="13412330">Certainly, that cannot be true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.311" offset="13416719">If you look at Franks v. Delaware, again you look the language of this Court, seen in deciding that Franks should now apply a principle of going behind the search warrant getting to the integrity of the statements made to determine if there's an intentional or reckless misstatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.207" offset="13496236">The Court in the majority opinion discuss the fact that there is no difference between looking at the sufficiency or facial sufficiency of the search warrant or to go behind the warrant and determine if there is something wrong with the integrity of the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.134" offset="13559975">In other words, the exclusionary rule should apply in both circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.336" offset="13572827">The case that I mentioned a moment ago, People v. Martin, which was cited in the respondents' original brief at page 25, is important for another reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.112" offset="13631864">The other reason is that apparently the State of Illinois in that decision tried to do in the state court what the petitioner is now trying to do in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.051" offset="13671674">And I believe the language is appropriate to repeat at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.205" offset="13688288">The substance of the state's argument on appeal is that Judge Stiegment's finding that probable cause to issue the warrant did not exist, was merely a substitution of his views for the findings previously made by Judge Munsch in issuing the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.865" offset="13746907">The state would have us rule that once a magistrate issues a search warrant which he finds to be based on probable cause another trial judge may not overturn that decision in ruling on a motion to suppress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.173" offset="13792151">The Illinois appellant court stated then, we cannot agree with the state's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.208" offset="13808242">Such a holding would immunize the reexamination of the warrant process and determine the ruling upon a motion to suppress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.944" offset="13835201">Counsel never urged that in the Illinois courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.265" offset="13852546">He's now urging this Court perhaps to overrule the statutory framework that all judges in the State of Illinois work under.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.686" offset="13882221">That is very simply stated a standard of probable cause based upon the judgements of reviewing trial judges and later appellant judges reviewing under that manifestly erroneous standard that the Court has adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.096" offset="13931854">I think it's important to, at this time, look at the question that is really before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.702" offset="13970201">We are dealing here with the warrant process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.153" offset="13984099">We are not dealing with the situation, such as Hill v. California where an officer reasonably thought that the person he was arresting looked remarkably like the defendant who he had probable cause to arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.477" offset="14037388">We are dealing with a very delicate Fourth Amendment warrant requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.198" offset="14056197">I believe it's important now to direct certain comments to that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.083" offset="14071766">The Fourth Amendment talks about reasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.102" offset="14083886">The Fourth Amendment has a warrant clause which specifically requires that probable cause be the standard, that the warrant be signed by a neutral and detached magistrate, and that there be specificity in the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.862" offset="14138848">By definition, a search warrant issued upon less than probable cause is per say unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.300" offset="14168628">To permit the introduction of evidence seized pursuant to an officer's inaccurate reasonable belief that he acted in compliance with the Fourth Amendment would establish a lesser standard than probable cause, best described as we did in our brief a reasonably unreasonable search.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.846" offset="14242815">The Fourth Amendment standard of probable cause would become diluted and in effect would become whatever the officer thought it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.868" offset="14278864">Dunnaway v. New York spoke to the question of probable cause and indicated there was a long history of testing the standard of probable cause against the standard of reasonableness as required by the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.144" offset="14339991">Dunnaway also said that the exclusionary rules should be based upon an objective rather than a subjective test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.400" offset="14369039">The key part of the warrant I believe is reasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.935" offset="14383145">It makes no sense to ask that an exception to the rule be adopted when the word reasonableness is already included in the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.791" offset="14418567">And this Court has, with regard again to the warrant process, has dealt with the question of reasonableness in cases such as Ventresca in which the Court will give more credence to a judge's determination which has been upheld upon review in lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.682" offset="14474156">And allow a little bit of leeway because we all understand that police officers are not legally trained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.038" offset="14499547">Therefore, the warrant process has already a built-in degree of sway between left and right, perhaps five degrees, to allow that reasonableness to already apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.144" offset="14539984">Again, as I indicated earlier, the warrant process is ex parte.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.898" offset="14563077">It necessarily implies that there are no adversary conversations to convince or not the magistrate to sign or not sign a search warrant.</text>

            <text syncTime="3633.221" offset="14704347">However, the purpose for the review process under the Illinois statute and under this Court's determinations in Aguilar and Spinelli is to determine if the magistrate's decision to sign the warrant was in fact consistent with the standard of probable cause as applied to search warrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.349" offset="14776863">I believe the question was asked on the argument of my opponents whether Nathanson should be overruled.</text>

            <text syncTime="3724.880" offset="15071001">And, yet, under the rule that you're advocating and I think many of the court's decisions undoubtedly support you the... if a police officer goes and gets a warrant he has to put in black and white once and for all his view of what facts amounts to a probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3743.741" offset="15146443">And it's very easy to simply review it as the moment it was presented to the magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3748.412" offset="15165042">But if he simply goes out on a basis of probable cause, it's a much more fluid situation where he can come into court two weeks later and testify what he thought was probable cause, and perhaps put a better face on the evidence that he has.</text>

            <text syncTime="3899.794" offset="15770561">They are totally asking this Court to avoid review, and they're totally asking this Court to avoid what is consistent with the Jones decision of saying hearsay can be the basis for a search warrant.</text>

            <text syncTime="4203.924" offset="16987135">If the hearsay declarant is a reliable person that can be believed, and what he says comes from some personal knowledge or comes from hearsay observations or statements by someone else, the On Lee case has nothing to do with that type of credibility.</text>

            <text syncTime="4244.383" offset="17148990">The recent cases... getting to the question of the non-application of the rule... in respondent's opinion, the recent cases of Havens, Janis and Calandra do not support the position of the petitioner and the solicitor general in that the Court had stated in those cases that there was no possible deterrent function that could arise from the lack of use of... for the use, rather, of unlawfully seized evidence in, for example, a grand jury setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="4277.120" offset="17279916">A grand jury setting being totally without an adversary situation; an investigatory body, the police officer's function or the police officer's deterrence really not effected by that type of a situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4291.529" offset="17337594">Since, obviously, if an indictment arises from the grand jury, that evidence could not be used at a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4297.017" offset="17359537">However, the mere perfunctory function of a grand jury to indict and to formally charge someone, the deterrent effect would not be violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4306.223" offset="17396317">Similarly in Havens the gentleman who was stopped at the airport who denied later at trial that the tee-shirt which was found in his suitcase had the pieces cut out of it which contained the cocaine in his partner's suitcase, when he got up and lied before a jury and said that tee-shirt wasn't his, although it was suppressed in a lower Court, this Court ruled rightly that he should be impeached by that because the fact finding and truth finding process of a trial makes more sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="4337.010" offset="17519511">Again in Janis the use of suppressed evidence in a federal civil tax case also makes sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="4343.498" offset="17545424">And as the Justice asked me, Stone v. Powell, in a habeas review, if the state had given a full and fair hearing to the Fourth Amendment question all the way up the state's highest Court, then there is no need to review it in a habeas corpus proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4357.841" offset="17602789">That again does not destroy the deterrent function.</text>
            <text syncTime="4360.376" offset="17612925">I distinguish in the brief, and I say again that the cases such as U. S. v. Williams, which everyone seems to be relying on to ask this Court to adopt an exception, can be distinguished totally... again a non-warrant case... that's the difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="4375.135" offset="17671961">Williams, the larger majority felt there was probable cause in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4379.337" offset="17688784">And it's understandable if one reads it that the officer who made the arrest, Mr. Marconey, knew the arrestee because he had arrested her before.</text>
            <text syncTime="4387.277" offset="17720549">And, I believe it was a reasonable mistake a fact and that's what the Court held.</text>
            <text syncTime="4390.895" offset="17734969">However, I believe, he had probable cause as did the larger majority in the Williams court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4395.364" offset="17752941">The Court has already indicated several exceptions to the warrant requirement incident to a valid arrest, plain view cases, auto search cases, inventories, border searches, consent searches, exigent circumstances, and, even, in Terry v. Ohio there was a carved out exception under certain circumstances of articulable suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4423.300" offset="17864641">It seems to us that the petitioner and the solicitor general are asking the Court to carve out another exception to make, if a good faith test is the basis for an admittedly no probable cause warrant, then, what good is the warrant process itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4438.876" offset="17926917">They indicate a warrant can be lacking in probable cause, but still good anyhow if the officer thought it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="4445.047" offset="17951576">I don't believe the Court is going to adopt such a standard in light of the language of the Fourth Amendment itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4449.518" offset="17969548">As this Court said in the United States v. Ross last year, good faith is not enough to constitute probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4457.873" offset="18002881">That faith must be grounded on facts within the knowledge of the officer which in the judgment of the Court would make his faith reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4466.360" offset="18036840">It's not just the judgment of the officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4469.431" offset="18049170">It has to be reviewed because of the ex parte nature of the warrant process itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4472.716" offset="18062335">There are defenders of the rule, I believe, the... one of the most important defender was a little six page brief filed by Mr. Johnston, the prosecutor in Polk County, Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="4487.476" offset="18121372">If one were to want to ask about statistics, and I don't necessarily believe in the empirical studies and I know this Court has indicated in its opinions that there may not be any that are really viable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4497.931" offset="18163168">But Mr. Johnston said as a prosecutor that the rule has served no serious impediment to prosecuting the guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="4504.854" offset="18190858">The rule has fostered police professionalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="4507.487" offset="18201411">He cites in his brief in 1980 over 6,487 cases prosecuted in his office, only thirteen of which were dismissed and only nine of those involved narcotic cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4521.447" offset="18257209">That's two out of a thousand that were dismissed because of the exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="4525.518" offset="18273509">I think that is probably the most meaningful statistic that I've ever seen.</text>
            <text syncTime="4529.136" offset="18287929">As a prosecutor, he feels that the Mapp case was a firm admonishment, that even a worthy law enforcement end cannot justify an unconstitutional means.</text>
            <text syncTime="4538.658" offset="18326068">He feels that police are better trained since Mapp.</text>
            <text syncTime="4541.710" offset="18338293">He says the result of any exception would be a signal to law enforcement to take the forth amendment not so seriously.</text>
            <text syncTime="4548.931" offset="18367132">I know the Court is familiar with the statements of others who have testified before or written letters to the senate subcommittee on the exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="4559.489" offset="18409346">Steven Saks is another example, the attorney general of Maryland says there is much more corporation between prosecutors and agents of law enforcement as a result of the exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="4571.195" offset="18456262">The bottom line is the prosecutor and the policeman want to convict if the evidence can stand up in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4577.700" offset="18482280">So, it would be as stated by Judge Stern, it would be a slander on the police, and a slander on the FBI and the district attorney and the United States attorney, to say that they would not follow this Court's decisions when they know that the exclusionary rule would apply if they did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4595.078" offset="18551766">Even Professor Ball, a proponent of good faith, concedes that the rule has accomplished increased police training and awareness about their responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4604.684" offset="18590218">Commissioner Murphy, after the Mapp decision said there was a total reconstruction in his police department in New York as a... from the top down to the foot patrolman as a result of the Court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4615.576" offset="18633790">To what weight the Court will give it I do not know, but we cite in our brief a footnote 10A and obviously this as 10A came as an afterthought only because the quote came in a newspaper shortly before the brief was completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4633.787" offset="18706619">The detective who authored the affidavit in this case was quoted in a Chicago newspaper as saying, if he knew then what he knew now about the exclusionary rule he would have better corroborated the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="4648.213" offset="18764298">This Court need only look to the array of a amici briefs filed in this case on behalf of the petitioner and on behalf of the respondent as evidence of the fact that the rule does in fact deter.</text>
            <text syncTime="4664.239" offset="18828350">Thirty-four states have either filed or joined in the filing of amicus briefs in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4669.043" offset="18847576">The International Association of Chiefs of Police have filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4672.328" offset="18860742">The National District Attorneys Association has filed as well as an array of amici on behalf of the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4678.316" offset="18884670">That indicates, I believe, that there is attention drawn to this only because of the effect of the exclusionary rule itself, the deterrent function.</text>
            <text syncTime="4687.922" offset="18923122">Perhaps the amici on the petitioners side are complaining because the rule works too well.</text>
            <text syncTime="4693.426" offset="18945170">If such a modification were adopted, even on an objective rationale, the practical effect in police departments will be that instead of strict compliance with decisions of this Court police will err more in favor of every questionable conduct and not even in close cases, thus making their own law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4730.599" offset="19093859">The police will really be telling the Court what the Fourth Amendment means.</text>
            <text syncTime="4734.403" offset="19109010">Review will be extremely tedious because of the standard of being objective will require someone to develop criteria against which the standard can be measured.</text>
            <text syncTime="4744.608" offset="19149865">Thus, Fourth Amendment law will be reduced to a series of Ad Hoc decisions instead of on a categorical basis so that law enforcement officials can have workable rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="4754.916" offset="19191139">And that conduct, of course, was shunned upon in the Dunnaway decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4759.868" offset="19210887">The Fourth Amendment body of law cannot be Ad Hoc decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4763.172" offset="19224157">It must be a categorical body of law so that the institution of police, not just the individual police officer, can understand what this Court says is proper under the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4773.111" offset="19263864">This Court should not modify the exclusionary rule in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4780.264" offset="19292494">The warrant process contains sufficient leeway in the context of reasonableness in its definition of probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4787.537" offset="19321542">Any lesser standard will encourage police not to comport their conduct to the standard of probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4793.607" offset="19345888">The cost of keeping the rule in terms of freeing some defendants is small in contrast to the overall benefit to society of keeping law enforcement in check and maintaining the delicate balance between individual freedom and the effective law enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4809.717" offset="19410254">Unless there are some questions, I have no further comments.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul P. Biebel, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="4826.428" offset="19477127">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4828.614" offset="19485904">The issue from our perspective involves an analysis of this case according to a probable cause standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="4836.970" offset="19519341">We feel that when historical definition of probable cause is taken into consideration which envisions all the facts and circumstances presented to the Court and to the police, we feel that a judgment in this case would be different.</text>
            <text syncTime="4851.461" offset="19577228">We feel that artificial rules often get in the way and cause situations where there are aberrant opinions which come down which defy common sense because courts feel compelled to imply hypertechnical evaluations of the rules of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4871.107" offset="19655909">Mr. Reilley talks about the Amicus Brief and the county eye of a prosecutor who indicates that he's had very few cases involving suppressions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4879.797" offset="19690600">That may well be true.</text>
            <text syncTime="4881.515" offset="19697496">But we have one here and we have a serious case, here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4885.451" offset="19713274">We have people who are undoubtedly drug couriers, the evidence of which has been suppressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4892.021" offset="19739501">Three hundred and fifty pounds of marijuana, seven hand guns and rifles in their house and large amounts of drug related evidence in their house.</text>
            <text syncTime="4900.744" offset="19774401">Even though the cases... even though there may be some dispute as to the amount of cases, the point is they do involve serious situations in many instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="4909.666" offset="19810136">And, this is certainly one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4911.934" offset="19819122">We feel that the price that the rule exacts in this case, the exclusionary rule exacts, is simply too high.</text>
            <text syncTime="4919.624" offset="19849947">This Court has ruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="4922.742" offset="19862381">Thank you very much.</text>
