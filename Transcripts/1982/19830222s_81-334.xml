            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="92312">The second case that I have to announce is Associated General Contractors of California against California State Council of Carpenters and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.731" offset="131182">The case arises out of a dispute between parties to a multiemployer collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.851" offset="155633">The plaintiff unions alleged that in violation of the antitrust laws, the mutliemployer association and its members coerced certain third parties as well as some of the association's members to enter into a business relationship with nonunion firms.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.113" offset="220730">This coercion according to the complaint adversely affected the trade of certain unionized firms and thereby in turn, restrained the business activities of the unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.696" offset="267019">The unions filed suit in United States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that they have been injured by conduct in violation of the federal antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.059" offset="308501">The District Court dismissed the complaint and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.682" offset="330967">We granted certiorari to decide whether the Union's compliant sufficiently alleged that they were parties who have been injured in their business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antirust laws and may therefore recovered treble damages under Section 4 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.358" offset="393661">For reasons stated at length in an opinion filed with the clerk today, we conclude that the Union's action may not be maintained under this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.522" offset="426366">We, therefore, reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.742" offset="439218">Justice Marshall has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
