            <label>Mr. Kenneth J. Guido, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="14.367" offset="198360">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.660" offset="223542">My name is Kenneth J Guido, Jr. I represent the New Jersey Legislature and the Democratic members of Congress in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.877" offset="252486">This case is an appeal from the judgment of a divided three-judge district court in New Jersey, which struck down a congressional reapportionment plan enacted by the New Jersey legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.654" offset="307552">On January 19, 1982 New Jersey enacted a reapportionment plan for the election of United States House of Representatives with a deviation that falls within the statistical imprecision of the census data.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.413" offset="378605">The plan in accordance with the notification from the Clerk of the House of Representatives based on the 1980 decennial census data reduced the number of districts from 15 to 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.186" offset="441717">The plan as enacted creates 14 districts with an average population deviation of 0.135 percent and a maximum deviation between the smallest and largest districts of less than 0.7 of one percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.771" offset="536071">The Legislature's criteria for redistricting was first numerical equality.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.285" offset="566059">The leadership agreed that no plan would be considered with deviations over one percent and that lesser deviations would be sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.231" offset="609841">Additional legislative criteria which was to be secondary to population equality were to protect minority interests by not unnecessarily diluting black votes particularly in the tenth or the Newark district.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.787" offset="688104">The others were to preserve the cores of existing districts as much as possible for all members of the Legislature and to preserve municipal boundaries, which, in New Jersey because there are so many of them, are small enough to be building blocks for reapportionment purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.700" offset="779741">Plaintiffs, including all of the incumbent Republican members of Congress, on February 2nd and 9, 1982 brought suit to declare this statute unconstitutional because they believed other plans submitted to the Legislature would have reduced the variation between districts to even lower levels than the 0.7 of one percent in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.970" offset="888828">The cases were consolidated and submitted on depositions affidavits, and exhibits without trial upon the agreement of all parties to this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.244" offset="941909">On March 3, 1982, the three-judge district court by a divided vote declared the statute unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.192" offset="989661">The Court read Kirkpatrick and White, the decisions of this Court, as requiring any legislatively drafted congressional redistricting plan to be held unconstitutional if there existed the possibility that a plan with a smaller deviation of census population might be developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.513" offset="1087046">The Court concluded that such a possibility existed in this case and struck down the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.604" offset="1111392">In doing so, the Court failed to consider the problems undisputed in the record with each of the plans rejected by the Legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.006" offset="1156949">The Court also gave little, if any, consideration to other criteria such as preventing the dilution of minority voting strength in certain districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.829" offset="1204283">The Court concluded that preventing racial dilution did not justify the deviations because the district with the largest black vote, District 10, was not one of those with the highest deviation.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.945" offset="1260708">And, finally, the District Court rejected the Appellants' argument that the as nearly as practicable standard of Kirkpatrick and White is satisfied when the population deviation is even less than the statistical imprecision of the census.</text>

            <text syncTime="299.799" offset="1340120">Do we really know what the statistical deviation is on variance from the census figures?</text>

            <text syncTime="312.152" offset="1389544">What we have in this case is that we have the statement of Dr. Trussell who is a demographer at Princeton... an expert demographer... and a noted authority on the census.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.381" offset="1438445">In fact, he participated in all of the studies that the census has.</text>

            <text syncTime="329.333" offset="1458298">It was my understanding, though, that there was no real consensus if you will, on what the most recent census variation might be and if there is such a variation people have spoken in national terms which would not necessarily focus it on that--</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth J. Guido, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="351.762" offset="1547950">--That is right.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.464" offset="1550771">Dr. Trussell is the only one who has focused that on districts as small as congressional districts or at the state level.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.744" offset="1583895">If I may return to my argument... The... Circuit Judge Gibbons dissented.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.083" offset="1621302">He concluded that where the deviation between the districts is less than the recognized margin of error a good faith effort on the part of the Legislature to achieve numerical equality has been shown as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.403" offset="1686504">And, courts in such situations should not substitute their judgment for that of the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.292" offset="1714089">The Appellants on March 8 filed a notice of appeal and applied for stay of the judgment pending appeal to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.505" offset="1747003">On March 15, Justice Brennan stayed the District Court's judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.175" offset="1769677">As Justice Brennan recognized in granting Appellants' application for a stay, this appeal presents the question whether the proper interpretation of this... what are the proper interpretations of the standards laid out in Kirkpatrick v. Preisler.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.359" offset="1834357">Do they require absolute equality, or do they allow for some latitude given the arguable statistical insignificant variance argued in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="439.336" offset="1898304">In this case, the essence of what we are arguing about is whether a variance of less than 0.7 of one percent is not good enough to satisfy the requirements of Kirkpatrick, Wesberry and White.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="456.408" offset="1966536">--Mr. Guido, what does that 0.7 of one percent translate into in terms of people?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_j_guido_jr" startTime="462.077" stopTime="779.914">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth J. Guido, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="462.077" offset="1989211">In terms of people it translates into a deviation of approximately, I think, 3,551 people between the largest and the smallest.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.194" offset="2045739">That is much different than in the figures that were in Wesberry, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.726" offset="2071862">In Wesberry it was 140 percent deviation or 551,000 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.440" offset="2098716">In Kirkpatrick, the deviation was 5.97 percent, or 25,000 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.278" offset="2130063">In White, it was 4.13, or 19,275 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.387" offset="2166530">The deviations in this case are less than the deviations in 11 other plans adopted in other states and fall within the range of, I think, approximately five other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.568" offset="2227238">At the outset, I think it is important to focus on the appropriate standard of review in this case, because the Appellees here and two members of the District Court below interpreted the standards of Kirkpatrick and White to mean that a redistricting plan adopted by a state legislature is automatically unconstitutional no matter how low a deviation it contains as long as it is possible to conceive of a plan with a lower deviation.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.740" offset="2371852">This is true, they argue, no matter what flaws there might be in the other plans, and no matter what the statistical imprecision of the underlying census data may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.467" offset="2422843">In reaching this incongruous result, the Appellee has ignored the admonition of this Court in White that from the beginning we have recognized that reapportionment is primarily a matter for legislative consideration and determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.227" offset="2493896">As this Court clearly stated, legislatures have primary jurisdiction over legislative reapportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.677" offset="2527646">And, districting inevitably has sharp political impact, and inevitably political decisions must be made by those charged with the task.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.671" offset="2575607">In balancing the commands of the one man-one vote rule of this Court against the requirement of the primacy of the legislature, this Court has evolved a pragmatic case-by-case approach in litigating these issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.994" offset="2644884">In Wesberry, it said,</text>
            <text syncTime="627.526" offset="2651049">"as nearly as is practicable, one man's vote in a congressional district is worth as much as another's. "</text>
            <text syncTime="635.879" offset="2684486">And, in elaborating on this standard this Court in Kirkpatrick rejected the fixed percentage formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.970" offset="2716773">Consequently, as this Court concluded in White, congressional districts pass constitutional muster if they are as mathematically equal as is reasonably possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.324" offset="2774242">In reading through those cases, the Court has focused on a number of factors in applying these standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.506" offset="2814993">The first is the magnitude of the deviation.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.179" offset="2829622">The Court has spoken in Kirkpatrick of markedly reduced deviations.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.409" offset="2858566">In White, it talked about grossly out of proportion.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.720" offset="2879777">The Court has traditionally looked at the accuracy of the data relied upon in drawing the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.670" offset="2911646">In Kirkpatrick at page 529 the Court mentioned the fact that the accuracy of the data can be a factor to be taken into consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.399" offset="2954487">And, on page 22 of our brief, note 17, we point out that the Court in Mahan and in Burns v. Richardson recognized that there may even be situations in which the census data does not have to be used because of problems of accuracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.471" offset="3022824">The third factor the Court has looked to in determining whether a plan meets constitutional muster is the extent to which the challenged variances fall within the range of what other states have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.545" offset="3075173">I have just pointed out to you where the statute challenging this plan falls with regard to other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.821" offset="3108192">Additionally, the fourth factor has been the availability of acceptable alternatives, which we will address in a minute, and the extent to which there exists legitimate justifications for the deviations.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.333" offset="3170259">In all of the cases that this Court has decided since Baker v. Carr, it has never stricken a plan with a variance as low as in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.561" offset="3231176">As I said, the variances in this case are no where near those of Wesberry, Kirkpatrick and White.</text>

            <text syncTime="779.914" offset="3260642">But wasn't it the position of the Court that there were other plans with a still smaller variation?</text>

            <text syncTime="786.490" offset="3286869">That is correct, Your Honor, but what we will address is the question of the inadequacies of those plans.</text>

            <text syncTime="797.502" offset="3330964">--While reviewing court drawn plans this Court holds to a higher one vote-one man standard than legislatively drawn plans, this court has upheld plans with similar deviations to that plan challenged in this action out of deference to the legislature although it holds court drawn plans to a higher one man-one vote standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.568" offset="3447261">Significantly, the plan approved after this Court's decision striking the statute in Kirkpatrick contained a deviation of 0.629 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.953" offset="3508806">In essence, the same deviation challenged in that action.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.234" offset="3525837">That occurred in the case where the Court imposes a higher standard under the one man-one vote principle on courts when they draw the plans than on legislatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.991" offset="3580904">However, it sustained a plan with a similar deviation.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.068" offset="3601175">The other factor that the Court has considered is the precision of the data that is to be relied upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.674" offset="3647673">As we point out in our brief, the record in this case reveals that the census count was not perfect.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.389" offset="3674526">It is not an entirely accurate enumeration of the population.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.512" offset="3698977">Its imprecision is due not only to the undercounting of illegal aliens as the Appellees contend, but also to the undercounting of other groups, people under 35, people over 65, immigration outmigration and certain other groups.</text>

            <text syncTime="1635.704" offset="6683728">In striking down the statute which is represented by this exhibit which was received in evidence by the District Court, the Court below said that since there were a number of other plans available to the Legislature including several which had been introduced as bills which had smaller population deviations, and since this redistricting statute was not the unavoidable result of a good faith effort to arrive at the smallest deviations in population, and since the record contained no justification for the population deviation contained in this statute, that it must be declared unconstitutional under the principles enunciated by this Court in Wesberry and its progeny Kirkpatrick and White.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.291" offset="7090089">The record contains no suggestion of any good faith effort or indeed any effort to consider other plans with smaller population deviations.</text>

            <text syncTime="3115.338" offset="12602344">But, the answer to Your Honor's question is yes, I would consider that to be a very important and valid consideration for a Court to take into consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.037" offset="12645080">Now, Appellants have enjoyed in this case at all levels including this Court to talk about population deviations which are within the limits of the statistical imprecisions of the census which makes them equal to zero.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.165" offset="12765557">If that has any meaning at all, and I suggest it does not, then it can only mean that any population deviation which already is created by the Legislature in adopting a particular redistricting plan has got to be a much greater population deviation if you superimpose upon it and add to it the statistical imprecision of any census no matter what that statistical imprecision may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.244" offset="12909962">Now, if the statistical imprecision somewhere up on high in the omnipresent sky, which we do not know what it is, is less than 0.7 of a percent as the population deviation here is, then their argument falls for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.504" offset="12974954">But, if it is more, let's say if it is one percent, or one and one-half or as was largely studied eight or nine years after the 1970 census a statistical imprecision of two and one-half to 2.6 percent... 2.6 percent supposedly... If it is that high then you have to add about 12,000 to 15,000 people to the 3,674 people by which you already have a population deviation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.725" offset="13095849">So, that this argument about population deviation within the confines of statistical imprecisions of the census is backwards because if you strive for zero population deviation it may very well be that because of the statistical imprecisions of any census in the nature of things, there would any way be some kind of a deviation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.385" offset="13206504">But, why strive for anything different from zero?</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.166" offset="13225625">If you strive for a one percent de minimus under the argument of statistical imprecision, then the cases before you will then say why not 1.3?</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.487" offset="13266899">Why not 1.4?</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.692" offset="13271705">Why one percent?</text>

            <text syncTime="3366.656" offset="13607535">We are realistic legislators and we know we have got the power now because we have got a democratic house and a democratic senate and a democratic governor, and we are going to get it before he leaves office, and on the day that the democratic governor left office, minutes before he left office, he signed this bill for the purpose of accomplishing the objectives which are described in Speaker Jackman's letter which is annexed to the decision of the Court below and which is before Your Honors.</text>

            <text syncTime="3587.502" offset="14490997">All incumbents but one were reelected in his district.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.049" offset="14517119">And, as the record shows, people were aware that the one seat that was lost could be attributed to Millicent Fenwick running for the Senate so that none of the incumbents would be hurt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.634" offset="14571454">Everyone knew that some members of Congress would move because the district lines had to be changed because they wanted to be closer to their core constituencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.630" offset="14619415">That is what the record shows about partisan gerrymandering, which is allegedly the claim of bad faith in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.954" offset="14656717">In addition, I think that the Court should recognize that this case is not a case about good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.372" offset="14682422">It is about a good faith effort to achieve population equality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.123" offset="14697468">The Appellees in this case have nowhere shown that even if partisan factors were at play here that they had any connection to the population variations that exist in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.102" offset="14765387">And, as this Court has repeatedly stressed, most recently in Rogers v. Lodge and Mobile v. Boulden is that you can make some allegations about... you can make allegations about certain things, but you sure to better show the connection between that and the harm claimed.</text>
