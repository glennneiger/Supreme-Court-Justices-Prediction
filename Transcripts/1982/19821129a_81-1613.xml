            <text syncTime="86.932" offset="482463">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="89.853" offset="494165">The question before the Court is whether the Tennessee bank tax violates federal law to the extent that it includes interest on the obligations of the federal government and its instrumentalities in the tax base, while excluding interest from similar obligations issued by the state of Tennessee itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.765" offset="577862">The Tennessee Supreme Court, reversing the chancery court, said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.685" offset="601476">We think the answer is clearly yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.465" offset="612657">There is no dispute as to the essential facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.306" offset="628017">In 1977, the Tennesse legislature made inapplicable to banks the existing intangible personal property tax on financial institutions which made no distinction between state and federal obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.940" offset="690502">And it created instead, in the words of the statute, a subclassification of intangible personal property designated as shares of banks and banking institutions to be taxed at 3 percent on net income of the previous year.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.997" offset="754763">Earnings are required for this purpose to be computed by including interest on obligations of the federal government and its instrumentalities, and also including interest on obligations of other states, but by excluding interest on obligations of the state of Tennessee itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.879" offset="822263">The tax in no event is to be less than an ad valorem tax of 60 percent on the value of the property of the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.034" offset="862910">The tax is an obligation of the bank itself, and is not collectible by either the state or the bank itself from its stockholders.</text>

            <text syncTime="192.856" offset="906169">Mr. Worthy, do you pay another separate franchise tax in Tennessee?</text>

            <label>Mr. K. Martin Worthy</label>
            <text syncTime="197.276" offset="923827">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.228" offset="927694">There is a... all banks and all other corporations are subject specifically to a Tennessee franchise tax which is imposed specifically on the... to quote from that statute... on the privilege of engaging in business in corporate form in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.657" offset="1021421">And every corporation is also required to pay an excise tax which is imposed specifically, to quote that statute, as compensation for the benefits it receives from doing business in Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.322" offset="1072098">There is no such language in the statute imposing the bank tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.761" offset="1085787">Appellant, the Memphis Bank &amp; Trust Company, a state bank, paid the tax as so imposed under protest for 1977 and '78, and brought suit in the chancery court for refund of the tax, contending that collection of the tax violated federal law to the extent that the tax applied to interest earned on obligations of the federal government and federal farm credit agencies, and thereby violated the prohibitions of state taxation contained in Section 742 of Title 31 of the United States Code, and Sections 2055, 2079 and 2134 of Title XII of the Code, relating to farm credit agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.743" offset="1265718">It was thereafter stipulated that if such interests were excluded, appellant would have no liability for tax for the years in issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.990" offset="1298737">Codifying a long line of decisions of this Court, going back to M'Culloch versus Maryland, more than 160 years ago, Section 742 of Title 31 of the Code specifically prohibits every form of state taxation directly or indirectly on interest from federal obligations, except non-discriminatory franchise or other non-property taxes in lieu thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.711" offset="1409601">The Tennessee tax clearly violates the general prohibition of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.663" offset="1429454">The state claims, however, that the tax fits within the exception for non-discriminatory franchise or other non-property taxes imposed in lieu thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.345" offset="1472190">Appellant submits that it does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.846" offset="1486192">First of all, it's not a franchise tax or other non-property tax imposed in lieu thereof.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="344.312" offset="1512001">Mr. Worthy, is that question to be determined as a matter of federal law, do you think, whether it's a franchise tax within the meaning of Section 742?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="k_martin_worthy" startTime="356.087" stopTime="426.244">
            <label>Mr. K. Martin Worthy</label>
            <text syncTime="356.087" offset="1559125">Yes, Justice O'Connor, I think it is to be determined as a matter of federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.757" offset="1573754">I have, obviously,... I think this Court has held that it should look at the effect of the law to determine whether it's a franchise or a property tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.331" offset="1612102">Obviously, the intent of the legislature and the authority under which the legislature acted are prime considerations in determining the nature of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.468" offset="1648673">But it is a question to be resolved by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.108" offset="1659227">Even if the tax is a franchise tax, we believe that it's clearly discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.744" offset="1697783">It is quite clear that in enacting the bank tax, the Tennessee legislature intended to impose a property tax and not a franchise or similar non-property tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.052" offset="1743027">The preamble to the act imposing the tax states specifically that the legislature is acting under authority to tax intangible personal property of banks, and to divide intangible personal property into subclassifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.359" offset="1808229">There is no mention of any authority or any statement of intent to impose a franchise or privilege tax.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="426.244" offset="1839785">So what your argument now is that even if Tennessee obligations were included in the basis of the tax, the tax is not one permitted by the federal statute.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="k_martin_worthy" startTime="437.771" stopTime="880.311">
            <label>Mr. K. Martin Worthy</label>
            <text syncTime="437.771" offset="1885865">That's correct, Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.054" offset="1890985">As I've indicated, the act creates a subclassification of intangible personal property designated as shares of banks to be taxed on the basis of 3 percent of net earnings, with the net tax in no event to be less than an ad valorem tax of 60 percent of the value of the property of the bank, with a credit for tax paid on its real and personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.058" offset="1990982">The tax is codified in the same chapter of the Tennessee Code as other property taxes, unlike those on franchises and excises.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.773" offset="2025881">Payment and collection are at the local level, in contrast with the provisions for payment and collection at the state level of Tennessee franchise and privilege taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.925" offset="2062453">Futhermore, the tax is allocated to the municipalities and counties on the basis of their respective property tax rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.874" offset="2098293">As I previously indicated, the bank is subject to both the regular general Tennessee franchise tax imposed by a different chapter of the Code and to the Tennessee excise tax imposed by a different chapter of the Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.933" offset="2154508">The state nevertheless says that because the bank tax is measured by income, it should be treated as a franchise tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.930" offset="2198498">This certainly does not follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.272" offset="2207903">The nature of a tax is not determined by its method of calculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.160" offset="2223367">This Court has many times held that a tax imposed as a franchise tax will be treated as a franchise tax even though it is measured by the value of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.233" offset="2263700">By the same token, a tax imposed as a property tax should be treated as a property tax even though the measure of the value of the property is income.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.525" offset="2300898">It's long been settled in cases going back to 1829 by this Court that federal obligations may not be included in the measure of a state property tax, and this principle is now codified in Section 742 in prohibiting a state property tax in any form which directly or indirectly taxes federal obligations or the interest thereon.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.456" offset="2396611">For this reason alone, the Tennessee statute should be declared invalid insofar as it requires interest from federal obligations to be included in the tax base.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.950" offset="2438616">But even if the Tennessee tax were regarded as a franchise tax, it clearly violates federal law because it discriminates against federal obligations by requiring that interest therefrom be taxed while specifically exempting in interest from obligations of the state of Tennessee itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.349" offset="2520118">There have been numerous cases in which this Court has stated that the proper test of whether there is discrimination is simply whether the tax is higher as a result of an investment being made in federal obligations than it would be if a similar investment were made in some other assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.606" offset="2601202">This principle is specifically demonstrated in the Schuylkill case, the first Schuylkill case in 1935, in which Pennsylvania imposed a tax on trust companies on the value of shares represented by investments in government obligations, but exempted from tax such value represented by investments in Tennessee... excuse me, in Pennsylvania corporations and such other assets as Pennsylvania chose to exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.516" offset="2708827">This Court said it is impossible to avoid the conclusion that the law discriminates in favor of companies owning stocks already taxed or relieved from taxation by the state, and against those companies amongst whose assets there are United States bonds taxed by reason of ownership of such federal securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.929" offset="2794508">Now, appellees in their brief vigorously criticize Schuylkill contending that it stands alone as authority in support of the bank's position in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.753" offset="2841738">Not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.911" offset="2846440">The principle is well established in other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.128" offset="2859292">In National Life versus United States in 1928, this Court applied precisely the same principle to a federal attempt to impose a tax on state obligations, invalidating the tax, because it required petitioner to pay more upon its taxable income than could have been imposed had its income from state obligations been derived instead from other securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.537" offset="2968902">And the test has been restated many times by the Court as a basis for finding lack of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.847" offset="2994188">For example, in the Home Insurance case in 1890 in upholding a New York tax, this Court emphasized that the tax sustained, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="723.983" offset="3030655">"would not be affected if the nature of the property in which the whole capital stock is invested were changed and put into real property or bonds of New York or of other states. "</text>
            <text syncTime="735.588" offset="3077153">That is, of course, the reverse of the situation here in that the tax here would be reduced if the investment were shifted from federal to state bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.820" offset="3118009">And although dicta, the Court in the Bank of Commerce case cited the statute in Weston versus City of Charleston in which federal obligations and most other personal assets, but not state obligations, were taxed as a prime example of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.000" offset="3182792">The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania more recently, in the Curtis Publishing case in 1949 in which this Court denied certiorari, invalidated a tax strikingly similar to that of the Tennessee tax involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.291" offset="3231903">Pennsylvania, like Tennessee, had adopted the federal test of net income including interest on federal obligations but excluding interest on Pennsylvania obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.303" offset="3275997">It was held by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania that the inclusion of federal interest while excluding state interest constituted unlawful discrimination against federal obligations, in violation of the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.597" offset="3329183">And just a few months ago, the Supreme Court of Alaska, in the National Bank of Alaska case, held that it would be an unlawful discrimination for state privilege tax to include in its measure income from federal obligations while excluding income from Alaska state obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.164" offset="3407445">In a slightly different context but involving the same principle this Court, in fact, in 1960 in the Phillips Chemical case, invalidated a state tax imposed on a lessee of federal lands where an equivalent tax burden was applied to lessees of all lands in the state except state lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.532" offset="3488947">The Court said, the state and the school district concede that Phillips would not be taxed at all if its lessor were the state or one of its political subdivisions instead of the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.871" offset="3534296">It does not seem too much to require that the state treat those who deal with the government as well as it treats those with whom it deals itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.664" offset="3577450">This language was repeated by the Court in invalidating a Washington state tax in the Moses Lake Homes case in 1961, and certainly applies here.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.034" offset="3618933">As very simply put in Curtis, the state has no right to tax federal securities while leaving its own untaxed.</text>

            <text syncTime="894.727" offset="3713705">Section 548 as now in effect and has been for several years and as in effect during the years in issue here, simply provides that the states may tax national banks to the same extent as they tax state banks, and that section obviously does not give the states any right to tax either state or national banks to any greater extent than they can tax any other corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.952" offset="3818613">Section 548 as it existed prior to its amendment provided, among other things, that a state could not impose a tax on a national bank measured by income to any greater extent than it imposed on manufacturing and mercantile corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.585" offset="3889143">Obviously, under the long line of cases of this Court and as codified now in Section 742 of Title 31, states cannot impose a tax on mercantile or manufacturing corporations which discriminate against federal obligations or the interest thereon.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.811" offset="3954032">I don't think Section 548 really has any relevance whatever to the issue before the Court today.</text>

            <text syncTime="983.207" offset="4067612">I probably didn't refer to the plaintiff but to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.863" offset="4086211">Now, the state suggests in its brief that there's no discrimination if inclusion of interest on federal obligations is casual or incidental, and that the federal obligations must be singled out for tax for the rule of discrimination to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.944" offset="4186521">But I call to your attention that that was not the case in the Phillips, just cited, where this Court was careful to point out that the tax burden on private lands was exactly the same as on federal lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.643" offset="4233333">Yet, exemption of state lands was sufficient for the matter to be treated as one of discrimination, invalidating the state tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.031" offset="4266874">And in Miller versus Milwaukee, a case relied on very heavily by the State of Tennessee in its briefs, the record discloses that the tax there involved did not apply solely to income derived from federal obligations, but also applied to income from a variety of other sources such as wages, salaries, business profits, dividends from activities carried on in other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.367" offset="4356213">And this Court held that the tax was invalid because of its discrimination in exempting income from other investments while including the income from federal obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.002" offset="4398740">The suggestion of appellees that the appellant has the burden of establishing that state obligations are in direct competition with the federal bonds, or the burden of establishing that the Tennessee tax inhibits the purchase of federal bonds simply has no support whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.604" offset="4485153">In valuing a debt obligation, a free market takes into account a great many factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.524" offset="4508872">The risk, the term, the interest rate, the rate of return after all taxes, and obviously, after everything has been taken into account, the burden of the bank tax reduces the value of federal obligations below what they would be if no such tax was imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.468" offset="4584627">And the absence of such a tax on Tennessee obligations increases the value of those obligations above what they would be if such a tax was imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.495" offset="4620781">As the Curtis case said, when Pennsylvania exempts from taxation its own securities but taxes directly or indirectly the securities of the United States, the latter securities are handicapped in their competition with the securities of Pennsylvania among buyers in the marketplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.771" offset="4697894">As far back as M'Culloch versus Maryland and Weston versus City of Charleston in the 1800s, this Court said that it would invalidate a discriminatory tax however inconsiderable the burden on the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.201" offset="4751602">And in both Smith versus Davis in 1944 and the New Jersey Realty Title Insurance Company case in 1946, this Court reiterated the principle by ruling that the exemption statute is intended, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.944" offset="4802593">"to prevent taxes which diminish in the slightest degree the market value or investment attractiveness of obligations issued by the United States. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.802" offset="4841986">It can hardly be said that the burden here is even slight or inconsiderable, in light of the Solicitor General's calculation in the Amicus brief, which the Solicitor General has filed in behalf of the federal government in this case, that imposition of a tax by every state similar to that of the bank tax imposed by Tennessee would impose an additional burden on the borrowing power of the United States of over a quarter of a billion dollars a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.850" offset="4958178">For all of these reasons, we submit that the Court should reverse the Tennessee Supreme Court and hold that the Tennessee bank tax violates federal law to the extent that it requires that there be included in the tax base obligations of the federal government and its instrumentalities and all the interest thereon, while excluding the interest from that of the state of Tennessee itself.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jimmy C. Creecy</label>
            <text syncTime="1240.009" offset="5094851">Mr. Chief Justice, and Justices, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.102" offset="5107181">Because of the impact of this case upon state and local government, a motion was filed to divide the argument in this case and it was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.454" offset="5140618">In examining the Tennessee bank tax statute here, Section 742 sets up two standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.890" offset="5170293">One, the nature of the tax imposed; and two, whether or not there is discrimination against federal securities within the meaning of Section 742.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.947" offset="5210521">For the purposes of oral argument, I will address the nature of the tax involved, and Mr. Minor Tait, representing Shelby County in Memphis, Tennessee, will address the discrimination issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.521" offset="5256810">Section 742 of Title 31 is a codification of many opinions of this Court dealing with the parameters within which a state may tax federal securities and the interest thereon, in accordance with the Supremacy Clause and the Borrowing Clause of the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.295" offset="5335909">As early as 1819 in the similar case of M'Culloch v. Maryland the principle was established that the states cannot directly tax federal obligations or their interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.041" offset="5390975">In 1829, the Court further noted in the case of Weston v. City Council of Charleston that a direct tax on U.S. obligations was prohibited and void.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.989" offset="5438727">Section 742, which originated and was first codified in the 1860s, sets forth this basic exemption that a state cannot tax stocks, bonds, Treasury notes or other obligations of the United States government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.729" offset="5505705">It's expressly prohibited by the Supremacy Clause of the Federal Constitution and the Borrowing Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.743" offset="5529738">However, this Court has noticed and recognized that a tax upon the corporate franchise or corporate privilege is permissible within the parameters of the Constitution, even though these federal bonds and interest may be included within the tax base.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.254" offset="5603821">This principle was first enunciated by this Court in 1867 in the case of Society for Savings v. Coite and was subsequently reaffirmed in a number of cases including Flint v. Stone Tracy Company in 1911, Educational Films Corporation of America v. Ward in 1931, and as recently as 1956 in Werner Machine Company v. Director of Taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.147" offset="5715312">Now, the first question the Court will face here in applying our bank tax to Section 742 is the type of tax that we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.142" offset="5763377">If the Court should determine that this is a direct property tax, then the question of discrimination becomes moot and would be void.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.482" offset="5796709">But it's our position that this is a franchise tax within the meaning of the second sentence of Section 742, which permits a non-discriminatory franchise tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="1433.178" offset="5867449">This bank tax is imposed only against banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.598" offset="5881137">We have a general corporate excise tax and a general corporate franchise tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.519" offset="5904856">Now, the statute which imposes the bank tax specifically provides that this tax is in addition to any other excise tax or any other taxes that may be imposed against the bank.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jimmy C. Creecy</label>
            <text syncTime="1489.297" offset="6091997">Well, Mr. Justice, I think the term 742 is a generic term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.185" offset="6123553">It doesn't include just, for instance, a tax on corporate capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.837" offset="6142152">As this Court has noted in several opinions, a franchise tax may include a tax on net income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.523" offset="6164827">I think the Court can quite easily rule that this is a franchise tax within the meaning of Section 742.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.303" offset="6195965">Now, there is some language there that says</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.161" offset="6207458">"or a non-property tax in lieu thereof. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.407" offset="6224386">on corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.236" offset="6231700">Now, the Court, I suppose, could take that approach and say that it is a non-corporate... I mean, a non-property tax in lieu thereof imposed on corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.153" offset="6271406">But it's our position that this is a franchise tax that we're imposing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.652" offset="6289378">Of course, the nature of the tax, rather than the label attached to it, must be determined by its operation and effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.897" offset="6330338">And, of course, this Court is not bound by the characterization of the tax which is placed on it by the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.534" offset="6356879">But this Court has noted in a number of cases that such interpretation is to be given weight by this Court in determining the nature of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.483" offset="6400660">The Tennessee Supreme Court in this case below affirmatively held that this was an excise tax, and it has done so in other independent decisions before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.494" offset="6448725">The fact that the tax may be included within our Code section that deals with direct property taxes, or that it may be denominated a tax in lieu of property tax does not make it a property tax, as is suggested by the appellants in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.205" offset="6519569">This Court has noted in the case of Tradesmen's National Bank of Oklahoma v. Oklahoma Tax Commissioner in 1940 that in defining a franchise tax, that a franchise tax is a tax upon a corporation for the exercise of its corporate privilege and franchise within the state, and further, that this tax may be measured either by net income or by net assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.007" offset="6626776">And that the two terms are used interchangeably.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.568" offset="6637016">So when we attach the label 742.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.921" offset="6670453">As I stated, the tax is not a property tax but in Tennessee it's a bank tax upon banks for the exercise of the banking privilege in the state of Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.466" offset="6720608">And for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.526" offset="6736908">Article II, Section 28 of our state constitution which was amended in 1973 permits our legislature to impose a tax upon banks and other financial institutions in lieu of the intangible personal property tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.722" offset="6797617">Now, the Tennessee General Assembly has done this in 1977 by this bank tax within the meaning of the statute; it specifically identifies the tax as an excise tax, it makes the tax imposed in addition to any other excise taxes or any other type of tax that the bank may be required to pay the state of Tennessee.</text>

            <text syncTime="1865.954" offset="7598636">I'm primarily going to address the question of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.641" offset="7617339">I think that this case turns on two simple points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.605" offset="7637192">Number one, what type of tax is involved; and number two, is the tax discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.916" offset="7666449">Now, it's clear that no state can tax an obligation of the United States unless Congress has given its permission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.052" offset="7706992">I don't think this point is even in issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.629" offset="7717336">At the time that we tried this case at the trial level, Congress had given the states permission to tax federal obligations in two areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.499" offset="7756729">Number one was 12-548 which was the right to tax national banks and national banks' shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.795" offset="7785986">31-742 gave the states the right to tax any obligation as long as it was a non-discriminatory franchise tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.226" offset="7835723">Now, at the trial level we raised both 548 and 742, but the Tennessee Supreme Court ruled that this was a 742 tax, which was a non-discriminatory franchise tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.346" offset="7892147">So I only briefly addressed that in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.080" offset="7903119">Now, to be a franchise tax, as Mr. Creecy has pointed out, it determines on whether or not the tax is on the business of a corporation... and I think it's important to realize that when you talk about non-discriminatory, you've got to determine are we talking about a franchise tax, are we talking about a property tax, are we talking about an income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.318" offset="8004056">Now, I submit that the appellants in their brief have lumped together all type of taxes that this court has heretofore ruled on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.939" offset="8038538">They have lumped together property taxes, they have lumped together income taxes, they have lumped together franchise taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.188" offset="8067481">Now, what we're talking about in this case is a non-discriminatory franchise tax, and that's all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.467" offset="8092663">We're not talking about a property tax or an income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.607" offset="8105202">Now, it's been held by this Court on many occasions that a state has wide discretion in enacting franchise taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.133" offset="8151282">That if a corporation comes into a state and gets the privileges to operate as a corporation, they must pay a tax to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.552" offset="8185032">And it's our position that a state has much wider discretion and authority in the area of a franchise tax than it does in the area of property taxes or income taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.204" offset="8231635">Now, when we look at whether or not this is a discriminatory act... and I'm not going to address whether or not it's a franchise tax or property tax because Mr. Creecy has done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.541" offset="8272908">But when we look in the area of whether or not this is a discriminatory tax, then we have to look to the decisions of this honorable Court, and we have to look to the intention of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.254" offset="8323795">Now, it is our position that discriminatory does not mean what the appellants would have this Court believe it means.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.702" offset="8361620">If you adopt the appellant's definition of discrimination, as I understand their argument they are saying that if a state exempts anything from a tax base, then they have to exempt federal obligations or else it's discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.167" offset="8423478">Now, I take that to mean that if a state exempted charities or hospitals or religious institutions, then by the same token, they would have to exempt government securities or government obligations.</text>

            <text syncTime="2237.196" offset="9083540">Now, the problem is that the federal government allows taxation on federal obligations, the income from federal obligations, so when you get the federal taxable income base, you've already got built into that all federal obligations.</text>

            <text syncTime="2612.027" offset="10582864">If you will look at 548, one of the definitions of Congress is that the money capital has to be in substantial competition with the federal obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.223" offset="10635632">And that is specifically set out in 548, which shows to me that the intent of Congress is that these other obligations have to be in substantial competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.717" offset="10677636">There's no proof in this record; it's just silent as a tomb, as they say, about whether or not there's any direct competition.</text>

            <text syncTime="2650.511" offset="10736778">Now, if they cite out... and they take great joy in citing the amicus brief of the Attorney General that some $250 million in obligations are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.537" offset="10776902">That's assuming that all of these banks would abandon U.S. obligations and buy Tennessee obligations, of which there's no proof at all in this record.</text>

            <label>Mr. K. Martin Worthy</label>
            <text syncTime="2738.882" offset="11090267">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.834" offset="11102074">Mr. Creecy cited a number of cases in which this Court has held that a franchise tax may properly be imposed on the interest on federal obligations or on federal obligations themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.030" offset="11154841">He failed to note, however, that several of those cases, the Educational Foundation case, the Werner Machine case, the Tradesman's Bank case and many others, all note that the states can impose such a tax, provided it is not discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.133" offset="11215341">For example, in the Werner Machine Company case, it validated the tax, held it was lawful, since the tax measures... since the tax is the same whatever the character of the assets may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.737" offset="11273751">Now, interestingly enough, when Mr. Tait talks about discrimination, he hasn't really told us what discrimination is except to say that all of the theories of discrimination which this Court has announced in numerous cases, are inapplicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.200" offset="11339579">All he says is that there is no discrimination if federal obligations are not singled out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.058" offset="11362985">As I pointed out in my original argument, in both the Phillips Chemical case and the Miller versus Milwaukee case, there was no singling out of federal obligations, yet the tax was found to be invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.191" offset="11407498">And insofar as the intent of the legislature in imposing the tax is concerned, I do call to your attention that the Tennessee legislature was specifically aware, when it adopted the formula for the measurement of income, as shown by the report of the legislative committee which is referred to on page 10 of our Reply Brief, that it knew that it was taxing interest on federal obligations, knew that it was not taxing interest on obligations of the state of Tennessee, knew that it was taxing interest on obligations of other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.145" offset="11547305">So it deliberately chose the course which it followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.218" offset="11559635">Thank you.</text>
