            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="141249">The Court will hear arguments first this morning in Commissioner of Internal Revenue against Tufts.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.932" offset="172909">Mr. Smith, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

          <turn speaker="stuart_a_smith" startTime="11.274" stopTime="309.527">
            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="11.274" offset="186284">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.552" offset="211362">This federal income tax case comes here on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.567" offset="239469">It presents an important question dealing with the tax consequences of the disposition of property subject to a mortgage.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.596" offset="271548">The Court of Appeals in this case allowed a loss, based upon a cost that Respondents did not incur and turned out never would incur, and thereby reached a result that we believe to be totally at odds with the economic reality of the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.384" offset="346780">The facts are relatively simple and can be summarized as follows:</text>
            <text syncTime="56.555" offset="367469">In 1970 Respondents formed a general partnership for the construction of an apartment project in Duncanville, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.143" offset="405817">They obtained a nonrecourse mortgage loan of $1.85 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.672" offset="431835">By "nonrecourse", that meant that none of the borrowers on the note bore any personal liability for the loan but that the lender bank could look only to the security of the property secured by the mortgage.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.884" offset="492753">In 1971 and 1972 the partners, of which Mr. Tufts was one, contributed approximately $40,000 in cash to the general partnership.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.880" offset="544684">And they included under the applicable tax rules, which the parties stipulate to be correct, a proportionate share of their $1.85 million debt in each of their bases of their partnership interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.529" offset="615319">In 1970 through 1972, when the partners held the project, they claimed approximately $440,000 of the tax deductions which represented depreciation and other losses in connection with the operation of the apartment project.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.724" offset="692119">Those deductions were entirely proper and are not at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.113" offset="713644">In August 1972 the partners disposed of the property subject to the mortgage to an unrelated third party.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.232" offset="750111">At the time of this disposition there never had been any amortization of the principle balance on the mortgage debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.904" offset="780831">That mortgage debt remained throughout the entire period of their ownership at $1.85 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.604" offset="815626">And at the time of disposition, the basis of the taxpayers' partnership interests had been reduced because of depreciation to $1.45 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.739" offset="864109">Now, this transaction came under audit by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and he determined that Respondents had realized gain of approximately $400,000 as a result of the disposition of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.545" offset="923355">The computation of gain was by reference to the amount realized by the Respondents in this case, the $1.85 million loan, which the unrelated party picked up on the transfer of the property subject to the mortgage minus their bases of $1.45 million, which yields approximately $400,000 in gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.441" offset="1027009">This case came to the Tax Court on Respondent's petition for review, and the Tax Court upheld the Commissioner's determination and, in so doing, followed a uniform line of authority above the Tax Court and of the other appellate courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.840" offset="1088553">And in a situation like this, a disposition of property subject to a mortgage requires that when the mortgage has never been amortized down at all, that the amount realized on the disposition of property include the unpaid mortgage balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.021" offset="1161278">The Court of Appeals, however, in this case reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.237" offset="1174131">It limited the amount realized to the value of the property that happened to be at the time of disposition, which was $1.4 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.795" offset="1228361">And it did so despite the fact that the property was transferred subject to a debt well in excess of this amount; that is, $1.85 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.227" offset="1270157">But the value of the property, we submit, has absolutely no significance to the tax consequences of such a transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.163" offset="1301817">As I shall develop, once the taxpayer's determined to transfer the property along with the debt, the value of the property is only relevant to the new owner and the lender who must look to that value of the property for satisfaction of his loan.</text>

            <text syncTime="350.745" offset="1544129">No, I agree with you, but how much practice and usage among the tax bar and the courts that decide tax cases, more often than we, has grown up in reliance on the idea that what you have described as "a dictum" is at least--</text>

            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="366.148" offset="1605778">Absolutely not.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.692" offset="1611943">The practice and usage is directly to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.471" offset="1627094">I think that it's fair to say that the tax bar, both public and private, has always regarded that footnote, as I shall point out in greater detail, as simply a response to the economic benefit analysis that the court engaged in, in part, in Crane.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.886" offset="1704730">But we submit, and the Courts of Appeals, apart from the court below as well as the Tax Court, has consistently held both before Crane and since Crane that the fundamental aspect of the Crane principle is the relationship, the functional relationship, between basis and amount realized.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.956" offset="1796994">And basically, our submission here is that since that basis is cost and it requires... that implies an economic outlay.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.279" offset="1838268">And in this particular case, the Respondents borrowed $1.85 million on a nonrecourse basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.604" offset="1871600">Crane, the principle of Crane allows you to include that loan balance in basis for purposes of depreciation or any other purpose, purposes of computing gain on ultimate disposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.254" offset="1930219">But the quid pro quo of including that in basis is that at the other end of the transaction, that mortgage balance has never been paid, you have to account for it at the other end of the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.373" offset="1990718">In other words, the notion is that basis is economic outlay; that is, cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.043" offset="2013393">And while we permit someone to borrow money and count it as basis, if they never pay any of that money, there has to be a reconciliation of the accounts at the other end.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.195" offset="2058010">The footnote in Crane didn't dispute what we think is the logic of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.005" offset="2081207">And in fact, the Crane decision, the rationale of the Crane decision, we submit; that is, putting, establishing a functional relationship between basis and amount realized requires that there be this reconciliation of accounts at the disposition of property the way it occurred in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="507.635" offset="2171695">--Why do you think Footnote 37 is there?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stuart_a_smith" startTime="509.900" stopTime="670.743">
            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="509.900" offset="2180785">Well, I think footnote... there has been a lot of ink spilled on this, Mr. Justice Blackmun, and I could only perhaps summarize it, you know, in a few sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.694" offset="2223940">I suspect that the reason Footnote 37 is there, I mean I think what happened in Crane is that the court engaged, in part, in what the commentaries refer to as an "economic benefit analysis".</text>
            <text syncTime="538.639" offset="2295724">And they, one of the things that the Chief Justice wrote was that, well, that Mrs. Crane got some kind of economic benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.949" offset="2328952">And in so doing that, what the court, in order to arrive at that result, the court had to equate her nonrecourse mortgage with some sort of recourse liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.020" offset="2381301">And it was able to do this because she conceded in the case that if the amount had been recourse, if the liability had been recourse, of course she would have been required to take it into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.561" offset="2431456">But she strenuously urged that the nonrecourse aspect of the debt made the case different.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.874" offset="2456743">Well, what the court said was, well, that wasn't really true in this particular case because the value of the property exceeded the mortgage balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.165" offset="2489866">So in a situation like that, the court equated recourse and nonrecourse debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.615" offset="2511705">And then because of this aspect of the analysis, the court wanted to indicate that perhaps that wouldn't be the case, that aspect of the analysis wouldn't apply if the numbers were reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.595" offset="2567607">But I think that everyone since that time has indicated that the economic benefit analysis of Crane is really not the heart of Crane, and it's not... the Crane principle stands on the logical bedrock of a relationship between basis and amount realized, and that if the code permits you to be deemed to have made an economic outlay and you get basis for this outlay even though you borrowed funds and you haven't actually put a dime out of your pocket, but implicit in that notion is that you will ultimately pay some money and if you don't ultimately pay some money the way Respondents did in this case, well, then... then there has to be a reconciliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.858" offset="2756629">And in fact, in thinking about this case, it seemed to me, if you sort of strip it of all its essentials, what it really boils down to is suppose one were to buy a suit from a department store and charge it, the $200, and then you wear it a couple of times--</text>

            <text syncTime="2415.979" offset="9805092">And that's all the court was saying in Crane, that in a case where the nonrecourse debt is going to be treated as recourse debt, there's nothing wrong with treating the entire situation as though there was liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="2472.753" offset="10032253">It happened the court said, the value of the property is the total property, unreduced by any debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.499" offset="10059211">And so we're not talking here or in Crane about a situation where we must replace that at the end of the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.732" offset="10088155">All the court was saying was that where there is a similarity and a resemblance that will cause people to treat these transactions identically, then there is nothing inappropriate about the tax consequences being identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.913" offset="10136847">And if we... a similar situation... if we were at risk in this transaction so that we were in default and a foreclosure sale occurred and a third party bought in this property at $1.4 million, and the bank then said to us, well, we want the other $400,000, and we said, well, we'll try to get it for you, certainly no one would say at that moment that we had any gain in excess of $1.4 million.</text>

            <text syncTime="2782.159" offset="11269830">Now, the Tax Court below said that clearly the language of this statute covered our situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.641" offset="11295744">They said, however, that the legislative history suggests that the 752(c) was to apply only in two situations; that is, where property is contributed to a partnership or withdrawn from a partnership.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.837" offset="11348511">We submit that that kind of result limits section 752(a) and (b) so unnecessarily as to be absolutely ridiculous, because there are other situations in which liabilities of a partnership may increase the basis of partners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.627" offset="11415698">For example, this would mean, as was found by the Tax Court subsequently in the Brontes case, that if a partnership acquires an asset subject to a liability in excess of its basis, that section is not within 752(c) because it does not involve a contribution of property or the withdrawal of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.104" offset="11497618">And therefore the partners would get increased basis in a situation like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.789" offset="11520397">Now, that case was reversed subsequently on the grounds that there was no true debt involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.271" offset="11542235">But had there been true debt in a situation like that, the ruling of the Tax Court below would have destroyed the efficacy of 752(c) in virtually all situations other than the contribution and the receipt of properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.592" offset="11595525">And we think that we all want a fair and consistent taxing treating system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.824" offset="11620498">We don't believe that the rewriting of two sections of the code which contain clear and explicit language... that is, section 1001(b) and section 752(c)... so as to recover what the government perceives to be improper earlier deductions taken at a time when there was no risk, is a proper method of achieving a fair and consistent tax system.</text>

            <text syncTime="2901.843" offset="11748602">The taxing system... in this particular case, the Respondents borrowed $1.8 million, they put it in their pocket, and then they went and bought... and constructed this building.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.619" offset="11815685">The value of the building, during it, their ownership went down to $1.4 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.600" offset="11839613">But then they transferred that property along with the debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.927" offset="11860929">They don't have to worry about the debt anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.423" offset="11870856">Although at one time they had $1.8 million, which they spent, they were not taxed on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.999" offset="11901158">The code gave them basis for that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2946.480" offset="11927071">They never had to worry about the debt anymore, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, but at the time, if they wanted to hold on to the property, they had to worry about the debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.933" offset="11956955">Now they have given the property away.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.587" offset="11971584">The debt is not their concern nor is the value of the property their concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.693" offset="11987989">That is the concern, as Justice White pointed out, of the bank because the bank has to look to the value of the property, which is the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.222" offset="12018082">The Respondents... the value of the property has absolutely no relevance to Respondents' economic position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.704" offset="12052041">If they were to, for example, buy a piece of land for $1 million, subject to a nonrecourse mortgage, and then the value of that property would go down to 900,000, to two, to $100,000, they haven't amortized the debt one penny.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.851" offset="12120586">They then walk away from it, they abandon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.038" offset="12129363">The Court of Appeals would say they have a $900,000 loss because the amount realized is only $100,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.879" offset="12164681">That... that is, to say the least, absolutely bizarre.</text>

I mean your opponent says that in Crane the court read something into the statute that wasn't perfectly clear that was there, why couldn't the court, in effect, say, well, looking at the code as a whole, a loss is not recognized unless there's an economic detriment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3084.422" offset="12478882">In fact, as Judge Friendly said in another context, any other course would render the concept of basis nonsensical by permitting sellers of mortgage property to register large tax losses stemming from the inflated basis and a diminished realization of gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.213" offset="12546069">We submit that the diminishment, the diminution of the realization of gain executed by the decision below is improper and should be reversed.</text>
