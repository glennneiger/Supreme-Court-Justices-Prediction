            <text syncTime="101.255" offset="555597">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I represent the state of Nevada, and I will be followed by Mr. Girard, representing the Truckee-Carson Irrigation District, or TCID.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.279" offset="599692">This is a preclusion case.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.980" offset="614425">The basic issue is to what extent the United States and the Paiute Tribe of Indians are barred by res judicata or collateral estoppel from seeking more water from the Truckee River in Nevada for the Indians' reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.020" offset="682657">We say that they are completely barred by virtue of the final decree that was rendered by the Federal District Court in Nevada in the so-called Orr Ditch case some 40 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.813" offset="737828">Now, Orr Ditch was no piecemeal, interlocutory, or open-ended proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.358" offset="771996">As both of the courts below found, this was a comprehensive, all-inclusive, quiet title water adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.339" offset="803865">It was begun in 1913, with the United States appearing on behalf of both the tribe, which had been set aside... rather, the reservation, which had been set aside in 1859, and also the Newlands Project, which is a reclamation project authorized by Congress in 1902.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.875" offset="890069">Now, Winters had been decided five years before this Orr Ditch case was begun, in 1908, so that for the reservation, the United States was seeking water for the primary purpose of the reservation which it deemed to be to convert the Indians from their nomadic habits into husbandry and agriculture, and therefore to give them water for irrigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.647" offset="997171">For Newlands, the United States sought enough water to irrigate the project.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.315" offset="1023816">The case proceeded for some 13 years, until a temporary restraining order was entered in 1926 by the court after a Special Master had heard evidence, and the TRO acted as a kind of a trial balloon.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.823" offset="1101870">Would the TRO work?</text>
            <text syncTime="239.648" offset="1109184">Was it feasible?</text>
            <text syncTime="241.322" offset="1115872">And this test period lasted for 18 years, until finally, in 1944, a final decree was entered which established the quantification for every claimant to this river.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.849" offset="1169893">It applied then and for the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.316" offset="1183790">It prohibited every claimant from ever again seeking water of the Truckee.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.797" offset="1209704">It contained no reopening provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.513" offset="1224646">As for the Indians, the Court of Appeals said the government placed in issue the reservation cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.587" offset="1260904">And now what do we find?</text>
            <text syncTime="280.008" offset="1270621">Twenty-nine years later, the government brought this action seeking additional water on behalf of the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.161" offset="1307193">The Ninth Circuit made two holdings.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.316" offset="1319836">First of all, it held that res judicata prevented this suit insofar as the Orr Ditch defendants were concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.141" offset="1355153">In other words, even if the United States should not have represented both the reservation and the project, which the Ninth Circuit did not decide, the Orr Ditch defendants were not aware of any impropriety, and consequently res judicata applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.385" offset="1420042">We believe that that ruling is clearly correct.</text>

            <text syncTime="352.917" offset="1562252">Right.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.759" offset="1565596">The court also made a second ruling, however, and this was two to one, with Judge Schroeder dissenting, namely, that the United States could take water for the tribe from the Newlands Project farmers because in Orr Ditch, the Ninth Circuit thought that there was no adversity under the pleadings insofar as the Newlands farmers were concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.064" offset="1666846">Now, the first point I would like to make, and incidentally, we obviously regard that ruling as an error.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.776" offset="1701642">We think res judicata applies across the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.916" offset="1710210">The first point is that there was nothing improper about the government representation in Orr Ditch.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.758" offset="1733615">In these types of case, as this Court is well aware, the government often has to represent diverse interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.035" offset="1758693">It may be reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.301" offset="1767784">It may be reclamation projects, national forests, naval bases, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.911" offset="1786174">And this Court said as much last month in Arizona versus California, when it approved Heckman.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.736" offset="1809475">Heckman, incidentally, had been decided only one year before Orr Ditch began.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.997" offset="1830582">There was certainly nothing improper perceived at the time of Orr Ditch by the government's representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.324" offset="1859839">It thought that it was proceeding quite properly, and very actively, on behalf of both the project and on behalf of the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.931" offset="1890246">Moreover, the government's good faith representation is shown by two factors here.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.114" offset="1911039">First of all, between the TRO and the final decree, the government actually obtained more water for the Indians than had been prescribed in the TRO.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.611" offset="1957015">They increased the amount that the Indians were going to get.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.172" offset="1967255">And secondly, in the Walker River case, Walker River Reservation having been established by the same documents... the same Indians, as a matter of fact, were involved... there was no project, no competing project, and the government still did not seek a fishery right in the Walker River case.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.132" offset="2043114">So, obviously, it was not acting because of any conflict in our case.</text>

            <text syncTime="503.061" offset="2162755">We concede that a discrete fishery right was not sought as part of the decree in Orr Ditch.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.666" offset="2197237">Now, the reason I use the word "discrete" is that the United States sought a full Winters right for the reservation, but it was seeking it primarily for irrigation, which it perceived to be the primary purpose of the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.330" offset="2251885">So, it also... domestic water and a small amount of water for fishery undoubtedly was thought about, but you have to understand, Mr. Justice Blackmun, that unlike today, where the government is seeking a tremendous amount of water to maintain the level of the lake, back in Orr Ditch, when they were thinking about a fishery right, they were thinking about a very small amount of water simply to allow the fish to get upstream to spawn.</text>

            <text syncTime="824.773" offset="3449651">It contends that the Orr Ditch degree permits it to change the manner and place and purpose of use of its water rights to non-project purposes or uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.207" offset="3487372">Basically, the government's contention is that it can allocate as it chooses the Newlands Project water rights to Pyramid Lake or presumably, if that argument is valid, to any federal purpose that it desires, including a possible MX missile site.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.480" offset="3560515">In our opinion, the government's contention is simplistic and wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.603" offset="3580995">Orr Ditch in the decree did not decide the ownership of the water rights as between the project owners and the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="1259.281" offset="5187630">We don't think that the duty was breached.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.094" offset="5194944">We think the attorneys in Orr Ditch did a capable job under the circumstances, but I would like to at least state that the United States' admission would be commendable if it were willing to assume responsibility for its breach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.526" offset="5264639">Its position is that we breached our duty, but someone else should suffer the detriments, the project farmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.474" offset="5300479">In fact, its position is even less altruistic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.580" offset="5316884">In the Indian Claims Commission proceeding, and those are in evidence in this case, the ruling of the Indian Claims Commission proceeding, the initial ruling provided that the tribe could recover its damages resulting from the loss of its water rights in Orr Ditch if the tribe could establish that the loss was attributable to the United States' breach of fiduciary duty in representing the Indians in the Orr Ditch case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.007" offset="5434539">The case was then set for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.490" offset="5444466">It was then settled for $8 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.037" offset="5462647">Then the parties to the settlement, the United States and the tribe, characterized their settlement as not covering the loss of the tribe's fishery right while at the same time agreeing that the $8 million precluded the tribe from seeking additional compensation from the United States for the loss of that fishery right if the end result of this case establishes that the fishery right is barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.540" offset="5580721">So, bluntly stated, the bottom line in this case is that the tribe received $8 million, it knowingly... and that $8 million was not for the loss of the fishery right in the future... it knowingly waived its right to go against the United States for compensation for that loss, and in addition, as found by the trial court in this case, in finding of fact 30, the fishery has been restored at Pyramid Lake by the expenditure of some $32 million for fish hatcheries and things along that line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.977" offset="5726484">So, the bottom line, at least in our view in this case, is that everyone has relied on the finality of the Orr Ditch decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.207" offset="5771415">The decree was entered about 40 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.394" offset="5784162">The temporary restraining order which was entered by the court was entered almost 60 years ago.</text>

            <text syncTime="1424.417" offset="5848215">The Orr Ditch decree, that decree has probably influenced in a major way the development of Northern Nevada, certainly Churchill County, which is where the Newlands Project is.</text>

            <text syncTime="3329.043" offset="13466670">The point I wanted to make is that the District Court in this very case as distinguished from assuring adversity on the pleadings among the defendants did not do that for the respective rights being asserted in this case to assure some way in which those rights would be met in a square conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.926" offset="13550262">Now, I wanted to lastly address one point that Justice O'Connor asked about, whether TCID and the project water users that they represent should be charged with the actions or knowledge of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.590" offset="13612851">I think there is considerable force to that point that when parties take through another party to a lawsuit, to some extent they must be charged with the acts of that party, but there is more here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.380" offset="13672097">Here we have TCID on behalf of the project water users affirmatively opposing the assertion of water rights by the United States, seeking to expand the water right for irrigation purposes, even, putting to one side the fishery right which TCID opposed even releasing water for two weeks in 1925 or 1926, I think it was, for the fishery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.638" offset="13765093">Here we have TCID vigorously opposing the assertion of rights by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.277" offset="13791633">Therefore, it is not just the circumstances, but it was brought vividly to TCID's attention that the United States had conflicting obligations to the Indian interests and to the reclamation project interests.</text>

            <text syncTime="3448.120" offset="13943039">If they win in this case, there isn't going to be any runoff water for the very interests that they are seeking it for in this case.</text>
