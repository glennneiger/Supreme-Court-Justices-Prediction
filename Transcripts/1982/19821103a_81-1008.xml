            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="150247">Mr. Martin, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

          <turn speaker="robert_martin" startTime="69.050" stopTime="270.531">
            <label>Mr. Robert Eden Martin</label>
            <text syncTime="69.050" offset="426414">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.971" offset="434041">And may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="72.080" offset="438534">October of 1976 the Interstate Commerce Commission prescribed a rate of $10.93 per ton applicable on coal moving from Wyoming to San Antonio, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.482" offset="488167">Its action in the so-called San Antonio I case was an interim measure to get the coal moving.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.573" offset="512513">And the Eighth Circuit sustained it, in part, on the basis that it was temporary.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.462" offset="528082">Now, in reopening the 1978 the Commission in the San Antonio II case modified its prior order by eliminating the prior rate prescription and imposing a rate ceiling of $16.12 a ton.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.894" offset="581790">This is not the prescription of a particular rate but a ceiling; that is to say, a maximum level.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.329" offset="607494">The Commission's decision at 0.18 of the appendix makes it clear and says,</text>
            <text syncTime="120.093" offset="630587">"It is not in any sense a requirement that the railroads increase their rates on this traffic to any particular level. "</text>
            <text syncTime="126.231" offset="655142">Following that decision the railroads did in fact file a tariff at the $16.12 level.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.680" offset="684921">Then on petition for administrative review in 1979 in San Antonio III, the Commission modified its decision and set a higher rate ceiling of $17.23.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.145" offset="730792">Now, it should be noted that the railroad's obligation to collect and the shipper's obligation to pay the rate derives not from the Commission's order establishing any particular ceiling but from the fact that the rate was filed in a tariff with the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.919" offset="793904">If the tariff were less than the ceiling, then the tariff is what the shipper would pay, not the ceiling.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.307" offset="815429">Now, following San Antonio III, the railroads sought review in the Court of Appeals in the D.C. Circuit on the ground that the ceiling was arbitrary, capricious, and unlawfully low.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.147" offset="854822">And San Antonio also appealed, contending that the decision was arbitrary and that the rate that resulted was too high.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.192" offset="878959">The D.C. Circuit in its first decision in June of 1980 concluded that the Commission's San Antonio III rate ceiling was arbitrary, it lacked adequate rationale, and the cost findings were not adequately supported.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.078" offset="930472">The entire decision in June of 1980 dealt with the new ceiling and whether it was adequately explained and supported.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.980" offset="958162">The Court did not in that decision discuss at all whether the 1978 decision of the Commission to lift the 1976 prescription was proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.602" offset="996614">The only question was the validity of the new ceiling and whether it was rationally supported.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.100" offset="1014587">Now, after the Court of Appeals decision and commencing with shipments moving on July 24, 1980, San Antonio quit paying the tariff rate and commenced paying at a level of $15.83 a ton, which it calculated to be the old 1976 interim prescription increased by general rate increases that had occurred since that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.559" offset="1104448">And from July 24, 1980, to May 7 of 1981, when they resumed paying at the tariff level, the difference between the tariff that was in effect and on file at the Commission and the rates that they actually paid amounted to approximately $20 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.428" offset="1163903">Now, after they quit paying at the tariff level and after other attempts to compel them to pay at that level failed, the railroads petitioned the D.C. Circuit to clarify that its decision with respect to the ICC orders in San Antonio II and III did not affect the railroads' tariffs that were on file at the Commission.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="270.531" stopTime="275.997">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="270.531" offset="1232343">Do you have any regrets in having made that decision to petition for clarification, Mr. Martin?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_martin" startTime="275.997" stopTime="311.326">
            <label>Mr. Robert Eden Martin</label>
            <text syncTime="275.997" offset="1254182">Well, I think not, because we were in a position in the fall in which we were not getting our tariffs paid, and we had to do something to clarify the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.039" offset="1306322">And we believe that under Wichita, the Court's decision in 1980 had not acted to revive the prior rate prescription; it had not had any effect at all with respect to our tariffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.691" offset="1352925">We thought that the quickest way of getting a resolution of that issue was to go back to the D.C. Circuit; hopefully, they would rule that their order related only to the Commission's orders and not to the railroads' tariffs.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="311.326" stopTime="314.201">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="311.326" offset="1395452">Did you give any consideration to going before the Commission?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_martin" startTime="314.201" stopTime="343.081">
            <label>Mr. Robert Eden Martin</label>
            <text syncTime="314.201" offset="1407050">Well, we did go before the Commission virtually simultaneously.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.589" offset="1428575">We did, in fact, file a tariff again at the San Antonio III level.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.056" offset="1454384">In other words, we believed, as we told the Courts, that our tariff on file had not been invalidated by our revived order, but just in case it had and to be careful, we filed a new tariff at exactly the same level and went to the Commission and said, allow this to become effective if, in fact, it's necessary to do so.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="343.081" stopTime="355.933">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="343.081" offset="1522511">Mr. Martin, did the railroads argue below that the CADC should not declare the tariffs unlawful because the San Antonio failed to comply with the filed rate doctrine?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_martin" startTime="355.933" stopTime="679.601">
            <label>Mr. Robert Eden Martin</label>
            <text syncTime="355.933" offset="1573920">Yes, yes, we did.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.246" offset="1579145">That... there were about four or five railroad submissions to the D.C. Circuit on clarification.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.930" offset="1609865">I can't give you a page reference, but it was in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.993" offset="1618120">Now, the effect of the Court's clarification in June of 1981... this is the second D.C. Circuit order... was to construe its earlier 1980 decision as requiring the railroads to roll back their tariff to the San Antonio I level pending further proceedings before the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.423" offset="1683844">And the Court then, rather than the Commission, decided what the railroads' rate should be during the course of the remand proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.561" offset="1712474">We believe that that decision, both with respect to the revival of San Antonio I and the "unlawfulness" of' the railroads' tariff is in error.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.525" offset="1752285">Now, first with respect to the scope of authority of a reviewing court, we believe that under this Court's decisions in Arrow, Scrap, Wichita Board, and most recently, Conrail v. NARY, the Commission has the exclusive jurisdiction to decide what the level of the rates or the tariffs should be and whether particular rates or tariffs violate provisions of the Act or prior ICC regulations or rulings.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.406" offset="1847788">We believe that reviewing courts have no power to determine what the rates should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.045" offset="1866387">The court's function is to review and, where appropriates set aside Commission orders, which is not the same thing as setting aside or passing on the validity of the carrier's tariffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.916" offset="1909855">Now, Conrail v. NARY is the most recent decision of this Court on point.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.194" offset="1926991">In that case the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit had vacated an ICC order that had established maximum rates on recyclables equal to 180 percent of variable cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.144" offset="1970773">The court had gone beyond invalidating the order and also ordered that carrier rates filed pursuant to 180 percent ceiling must be revoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.250" offset="2003165">And this Court summarily reversed, holding that the Commission's failure to adequately support the 180 percent ceiling did not mean that the ceiling or rate set at that ceiling were "rejected outright".</text>
            <text syncTime="474.072" offset="2046528">As this Court pointed out, rates up to that ceiling might eventually prevail at the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.946" offset="2069934">There was thus no basis for that portion of the Court of Appeals order which had gone beyond striking down the order and invalidating the carriers' tariffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.411" offset="2103788">Now, that case is squarely on point in rejecting the proposition that the function of a reviewing court is to restore the status quo ante, which is what the District Court of Appeals in this case did.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.484" offset="2160108">The function of the reviewing court is not to restore the status quo ante; it is to allow the Commission on remand to decide the validity of the carrier's rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.948" offset="2193963">Now, that is very close to what happened in this case, where the Commission's San Antonio III decision establishing a rate ceiling was set aside because the rationale was not adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.618" offset="2232624">But the Court of Appeals' first decision in 1980 left open the possibility that rates at that same level might eventually prevail after the Commission's proceeding on remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.865" offset="2269614">The problem is that if the Court's 1981 decision, which is here on review, is valid, it would mean that for some interim period of time the old 1976 temporary rate would apply and no matter what the Commission might decide on the remand, the carriers could never recover their tariff rate for that interim period.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.340" offset="2351534">Now, the court below recognizes these consequences of its decision, but it in effect blames them on the revived 1976 order of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.274" offset="2391240">However, there is nothing in Wichita, nothing in Conrail v. NARY which suggests that the holding of those cases depended on whether the Commission had issued one order or two orders to 10 orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.160" offset="2438887">So long as the tariff rate might eventually prevail on remand before the Commission, than the reviewing court has no power to interfere with the tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.734" offset="2477130">We believe that is the holding of Conrail v. NARY.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.764" offset="2485280">Now, this limitation on a reviewing court's power would apply even if San Antonio I had been revived.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.231" offset="2515165">In fact, the Commission in 1976 had clearly intended that the order be temporary, to get the traffic moving.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.243" offset="2543168">This is in the appendix at E-13 and F-2.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.992" offset="2554139">And by its own terms the '76 order had life only</text>
            <text syncTime="604.928" offset="2569917">"until the further order of the Commission. "</text>
            <text syncTime="607.787" offset="2581307">And such a further order was, in fact, issued in 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.629" offset="2596667">Thus by its own terms the original 1976 order ceased to have any effect two years before the period in question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.080" offset="2626551">But even more fundamentally, the Commission did not bring the 1976 order back to life in 1980 or in 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.936" offset="2657898">The Commission has never ruled, never found, that a reasonable maximum rate for 1980-81 would be at the San Antonio I level.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.870" offset="2689663">In fact, in its April 1981 decision the Commission concluded that the San Antonio I rate was F-4 in the appendix; and</text>
            <text syncTime="646.350" offset="2735638">"cannot have continued validity because of the new statutory threshold on ICC maximum rate jurisdiction and because of the changed statutory standards since 1976. "</text>
            <text syncTime="656.330" offset="2775553">That is at F-8 in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.766" offset="2789241">So the question really is where an agency rate order which was temporary in the first place expires, where the agency has not itself brought the order back to life and where the agency in fact believes that the old order is out of date and wrong and would not be revived if it was up to the Commission, can a reviewing court bring it back to life for the period of the remand?</text>

            <text syncTime="679.601" offset="2868549">In the Commission procedures is there any practice parallel to the one in probate matters of a dependent relative revocation so that when a subsequent order is set aside, it revives the last proceeding?</text>

            <text syncTime="701.218" offset="2955067">No, Your Honor, because the reason for that is because of the interrelationship between the tariffs which are on file and the maximum rate orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.074" offset="2986518">The Commission can fully protect everyone, and that's the difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.791" offset="3005326">Where you've got a will and another will, what do you do in the meantime?</text>
            <text syncTime="716.244" offset="3015148">Well, you don't have that problem in the ICC or in other statutory situations that are built on the Interstate Commerce Act because there's a tariff there, and if the tariff turns out to be have been too high, the Commission can award reparations and protect everybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.846" offset="3073558">In other words, if we had a $20 tariff on file and the Commission ultimately concluded it wasn't $15, it was $17.50, that would have been a fair maximum reasonable rate for that interim period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.374" offset="3115667">The Commission isn't stuck with the alternative of either the $20 or the $15.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.090" offset="3134580">It can say, $17.50 was the maximum, pay the reparations back to the $17.50 to make the shipper whole for the excess of the tariff during that period, and pay them interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.869" offset="3173659">It can do that, and it has done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.055" offset="3186407">Now, what it cannot do is authorize the railroads to go back and once its tariff has been reduced, collect more.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.615" offset="3208663">In other words, if our tariff was reduced from $20 to $15 for an interim period of time and the Commission later concluded that it really ought to have been $20 or $22 or $13 or anything above that there's no power to authorize the railroads to go back and retroactively collect that higher amount from the shipper.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.748" offset="3277209">But the reason that the will situation really isn't analogous is because of the Commission's flexibility to determine what between the $20 and the $15 is a fair rate and--</text>

            <text syncTime="803.880" offset="3365711">The carriers go file a tariff, and the tariff becomes the rate that has to be paid by virtue of the fact that it's filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.659" offset="3388804">And what the Commission would do is look at the tariff and say is that too high or unlawful for any reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.655" offset="3412836">Now, if after having locked, it says that that $20 tariff is too high, we hereby order the railroads to reduce, and then two things happen: For the future, once the tariff is reduced, that reduced tariff becomes the rate that the shipper has to pay, and so for the future we are taken care of.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.759" offset="3473231">Now, the question is, what do you do about the past?</text>
            <text syncTime="832.353" offset="3479605">And if the $20 ought to have been $17.50, the shipper is protected by the reparations and the interest on the reparations.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.430" offset="3503951">But the problem we've got is that if when an order is set aside that had approved a higher rate, the effect of that order is automatically to invalidate not only the order but our tariff and make our tariff unlawful for some period in the past and it gives the Commission no opportunity to make a determination of whether it was reasonable or not, then we are stuck because there's nothing we can do for that interim period of time, and here it was nine months and $20 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.450" offset="3599978">Now, the problem here is not simply one of exceeding the Court's jurisdiction to review orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.245" offset="3623174">It interferes directly with the statutory ratemaking scheme because you have a period of rising costs and changing regulatory standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.835" offset="3661522">It is not at all uncommon for the ICC or other regulatory agencies to issue a succession of rate orders that will reflect successively higher maximum rates, which is what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.035" offset="3706348">Under this ruling, whenever one such order is set aside on review, the last prior lawful order would bounce back into effect, revived for some period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.031" offset="3738322">And that would happen no matter how outdated the prior order was.</text>

            <text syncTime="955.991" offset="3974156">But the problem here is not only that time has passed but that in 1976 the Commission passed a new rule of ratemaking, 10704(b)(2) of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.659" offset="4024833">That was not applied in the 1976 first order because that proceeding was in midstream by the time the Act was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.672" offset="4052836">But it was a brand-new rule of ratemaking.</text>

            <text syncTime="1073.101" offset="4442583">The United States and the Interstate Commerce Commission agree with petitioners that the Court of Appeals decision in this case violates the rule against judicial ratemaking established in this Court's Wichita and Conrail decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.034" offset="4498381">The decision below basically interferes with the Commission's exclusive authority to determine proper rates, and it reaches an inequitable result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.904" offset="4533803">San Antonio has argued that Wichita and Conrail are distinguishable because they do not involve successive rate orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.807" offset="4577375">But the effect of the Court's holding in earlier ICC order revived in declaring inconsistent tariff rates unlawful is precisely the same as if the Court had directly enjoined the railroads from collecting tariff rates during the period in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.785" offset="4641323">In either situation, the Commission is precluded from making its own determination of the proper rate levels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.406" offset="4667863">The Court of Appeals remand decision left open the possibility that the San Antonio rate level would prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.638" offset="4696703">Now, under the teaching of Wichita and Conrail on the proper role of the Court of Appeals in this situation should have been to preserve the agency's authority to determine what rates are reasonable for the period on remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.476" offset="4752082">However, the Court, rather than preserve the Commission's authority, essentially has usurped the authority of the Commission by declaring the tariff rates unlawful during the period--</text>

            <text syncTime="1223.836" offset="5045489">Well, Conrail was... Conrail was the first case in which a majority of this Court held that a reviewing court has no authority at all with which to set rates or determine rate policy in the context of a remanded proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.314" offset="5115498">Now, the argument that the Court of Appeals overstepped its bound under Wichita and Conrail we feel is also supported by the filed rate doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.558" offset="5180386">If we look at the record in this case, the only tariff that was on file during the remand period at issue here, the 10-month, 9 or 10-month period at issue, was the tariff filed at the San Antonio III level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.519" offset="5248304">There was, in fact, no tariff on file governing the movements in question at the level of San Antonio I.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.736" offset="5273173">Yet during the entire period in question here, San Antonio paid only the rate at the San Antonio I level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.404" offset="5311834">The Court's decision, by declaring tariff rates... tariff rates here unlawful has rewarded San Antonio's resort to self-help and, in effect, sanctioned San Antonio's violation of the filed rate doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.476" offset="5372125">The filed rate doctrine has its origins in the Interstate Commerce Act, which requires shippers to pay and carriers to collect only filed tariff rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.379" offset="5403680">If a shipper believes that a filed tariff rate is unlawful either because it's inconsistent with the Commission rate order or for any other reason, the proper remedy is to challenge the filed rate before the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.921" offset="5453836">And if the Commission at that point finds the rate unlawful, it may award the shipper reparations for any overcharge and any interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.480" offset="5488108">Thus, the shipper is fully protected by the statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.212" offset="5507021">San Antonio, however, has argued that it is excused from paying the tariff rate for this period because the Act prohibits carriers from publishing or collecting rates in excess of those prescribed by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.238" offset="5559161">But the question here is what rate the shipper must pay when there is an ongoing dispute over whether the tariff rate is in violation of the Commission's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.562" offset="5600435">It is not up to a shipper like San Antonio or even to the Court of Appeals to decide in the first instance whether a tariff rate is or is not unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.667" offset="5644843">The Commission is not arguing here that filed rates are automatically the lawful rates that govern a particular movement in questions but that the determination of lawful rates is for the Commission to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.521" offset="5696252">The only way to preserve the Commission's authority to make a determination, we submit, is to adhere to the filed rates with the remedy, of course, of reparations in the event the shipper wishes to file a complaint in testing the validity of a tariff rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.312" offset="5759468">Thus, the purpose of the filed rate doctrine essentially is to provide a rigid rule; that is, the shipper must pay the filed rate until the dispute over the proper rate is resolved by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.838" offset="5809519">The filed rate doctrine, therefore, like the rule in Wichita and Conrail, preserves the Commission's jurisdiction over rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.240" offset="5839194">The Court of Appeals decision in this case, however, violates both the Wichita and Conrail and the filed rate doctrines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.315" offset="5871481">Accordingly, for the reasons I have stated and those we have stated in our briefs, the Commission and the United States respectfully request the judgment of the Court of Appeals be reversed.</text>

            <label>Mr. William L. Slover</label>
            <text syncTime="1548.501" offset="6344193">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.938" offset="6357986">I represent the City of San Antonio, one of the respondents in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.593" offset="6372614">In their arguments on brief and in their presentations to the Court this morning the petitioners and the federal respondents raised three separate and distinct allegations of error in connection with the decision of the Court of Appeals below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.212" offset="6431024">First, they contend that the decision violates the principles which this Court has enunciated in the line of decisions beginning with Arrow and culminating recently with Conrail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.410" offset="6475850">They contend the decision violates those principles whether or not the San Antonio I rate order was restored or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.704" offset="6508974">Secondly, they assert that the court erred in finding that the San Antonio I rate order had continued in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.717" offset="6541052">Finally, they charged that the court below erred in its decision in that it violated the filed rate doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.917" offset="6573862">Now, in the time allotted to me, and hopefully, in quite a bit less, I am going to try to respond to each of those three arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.913" offset="6605836">But before I do, I would like to emphasize one aspect by way of factual background; and that is, the significance of the San Antonio I rate order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.207" offset="6647005">It has a very practical significance to my client because it has been the only constraining force against runaway rail prices during the nation's energy crisis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.451" offset="6692040">And secondly, it is extremely critical to this litigation because all of this voluminous record... and indeed, we submit, this very action before the Court today... is one of a series of unceasing efforts by the railroads to extricate themselves from the constraint of the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.288" offset="6767377">So as we go through each of these arguments, we submit that the very distinguishing feature is the San Antonio I order itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.486" offset="6816174">And in that connection, this case is a very unique case in the sense that very, very little railroad transportation takes place under prescribed rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.324" offset="6871449">A statistically immeasurable amount of transportation has taken place with rate restrictions in virtually very little experience in successive orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.116" offset="6914707">So you have here a very unusual situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.975" offset="6926097">Now, as I say, the basic allegation of error is that the court below violated this Court's rules in Wichita and Conrail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.643" offset="6968729">And those rules, very generally speaking, divide the functions between the judiciary and in this case the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.218" offset="6999031">They draw a line of demarcation where this Court has suggested that the... that the laws and the policy of the Congress have ousted the federal judiciary from taking injunctive action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.056" offset="7050440">And their basic allegation asserts that the court below crossed over this forbidden line into this forbidden territory in its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.567" offset="7096415">Now, I think I have fairly stated what they're saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.301" offset="7107387">But how the court did it is not nearly as clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.347" offset="7123583">And what they have done or what they are seeking in this Court to do is to stretch and expand the principles and boundaries that exist today in the Arrow line of decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.372" offset="7175723">And basically, they're very easily stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.872" offset="7185649">In Arrow and Scrap the Court concluded that the federal courts should not take injunctive action prior to the time that the Interstate Commerce Commission has acted finally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.070" offset="7230476">And in Wichita and Conrail they concluded that the Court should not take intrusive injunctive action where the ICC has acted finally but the Court reverses or remands that action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.797" offset="7293378">So we have a body of law that ousts the federal judiciary from taking preclusive or injunctive action in these ratemaking areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.480" offset="7344160">Now, of course, here there isn't any injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.275" offset="7355341">So what my opponents' case comes down to is this word "affects".</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.336" offset="7383553">They are asking you here today to buy the affects test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.616" offset="7396614">They are saying when a reviewing court reaches an action which affects rates, then that should be discouraged in the same way that overt injunctive action is.</text>

            <text syncTime="1841.134" offset="7514688">But the distinction, as we see it, is that unlike the Wichita case, here the court was doing something that it was eminently qualified to do: It was construing an order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.864" offset="7573620">And the considerations which caused this Court to oust the judiciary in Wichita and Conrail are in to way applicable to the construction of orders.</text>

            <text syncTime="1889.880" offset="7709666">Well, of course, Your Honor, we submit that this Court's decision and the Arizona Grocery case is dispositive on that point, that neither the Commission... in other words, for example, the Commission itself could not have at the end of the proceeding said, we have examined this initial rate and we find that at some point in the past it became unsatisfactory, so we are going to set a rate for the future and also adjust for the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.163" offset="7846861">That process could not have taken place with or without the district... the Cicruit Court action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.973" offset="7874133">So the rate prescription order can never be retroactively adjusted under the rulings of this Court and Arizona Grocery.</text>

            <text syncTime="1959.040" offset="7986355">So the difficulty that we have with the so-called affects test that they're striving to extend Conrail beyond injunctions is that none of the considerations which bothered the court in Conrail... in other words, when a court enters an injunction, it has to decide, one, who is going to win on the merits or the probability of success; and secondly, irreparable injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.545" offset="8092412">Now, in Conrail the court said that the federal courts should not be engaging in these type of considerations, which in the first instance should initially be considered by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.710" offset="8145075">They felt that the injunctive process was intrusive upon the Commission's area of expertise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.411" offset="8175795">But there's no expertise in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.238" offset="8187184">The court simply construed a rate order, an order which this Court has held has the force of a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.907" offset="8221875">None of the considerations behind Conrail apply to a judge's or a Circuit Court's construction of a rate order.</text>

            <text syncTime="3533.850" offset="14285627">--No, if that's what he said he's wrong, because the problem is with respect to the hole in the middle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.846" offset="14313630">The whole 1978 to the present and the issue of the maximum rate is before the Commission right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.485" offset="14336095">But if San Antonio is right, then there is a chunk of that period from July of 1980 to May of 1981 in which the Commission would not have jurisdiction to decide what's a maximum reasonable rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.402" offset="14379772">So the Commission could, according to his theory, find that the San Antonio II level was okay from '78 to '79, the San Antonio III level was okay from '79 to 80.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.289" offset="14415403">But there's a dip for nine months in which the Commission has no power to do anything because of the D.C. Circuit's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.005" offset="14442257">And then from May of '81 on, again jurisdiction would revert to the Commission to find what's a maximum reasonable rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.565" offset="14468484">Our theory is that there's no hole, that the Commission has jurisdiction over the entire period.</text>

            <text syncTime="3592.340" offset="14519579">Back in May of 1981 the Commission, in the decision that is in the brown book at 5, restored pricing freedom to the carriers.</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_martin" startTime="3607.694" stopTime="3738.345">
            <label>Mr. Robert Eden Martin</label>
            <text syncTime="3607.694" offset="14581019">If you reverse, we will be able to go back and collect from them for that interim period of nine months our tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.910" offset="14609858">And then if the Commission decides that the tariff was too high for that period or any other portion of this four-year period, it can require us, yes, sir, to pay reparations and to pay interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.404" offset="14655834">Now, I would like to address the point that was made about San Antonio I being the only constraining force on the railroads and you have to somehow affirm the Court of Appeals because it's the only constraining force.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.181" offset="14702959">That just isn't right, because from 1978 to '80 it didn't exist and it doesn't exist today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.930" offset="14725947">I would like to call the Court's attention to the Appendix F-11, which is where the May 7, 1981, order appears.</text>
            <text syncTime="3652.769" offset="14761264">And as of that date and that order, San Antonio I on everybody's theory is gone, everybody's.</text>
            <text syncTime="3659.501" offset="14788223">And Judge Wilkie acknowledged it in his decision at A-6.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.201" offset="14811001">So that is gone, and the Commission has jurisdiction over the entire period to implement the standards of the Act, and the only question is whether there's a nine-month chunk in the middle of that period over which it has no jurisdiction and over which it has no alternative except to restore a rate which it believes is out of date by years, is inconsistent with the statutory standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3685.053" offset="14890414">Again, a brief reference, at F-7 and F-8 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3690.395" offset="14911729">We don't have to speculate about what the Commission's intent is, at least today, because we know.</text>
            <text syncTime="3695.330" offset="14931478">In May of 1981 it got out this decision, in which it said that the San Antonio rate is supported neither by current cost data or current legal standards, or at least that there's no reason to believe it is, and that not even San Antonio contends that its evidence would ultimately justify reimposition of the San Antonio prescription.</text>
            <text syncTime="3714.166" offset="15006815">This is the Commission in May of '81.</text>
            <text syncTime="3717.009" offset="15018205">It says that the San Antonio I rate, if restored, would be way below even the threshold for Commission maximum rate jurisdiction, and a rate of that kind "cannot have continued validity".</text>
            <text syncTime="3730.988" offset="15074107">This is at F-8 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3732.222" offset="15079122">So we know what the Commission's view is in the wake of the remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3734.705" offset="15089049">We know what the Commission's view is in 1980-81.</text>
            <text syncTime="3737.470" offset="15100125">We don't have to speculate about it.</text>
