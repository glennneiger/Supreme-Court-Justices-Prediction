            <label>Mr. Samuel A. Alito Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="6.015" offset="183634">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, since before the adoption of the Fourth Amendment, Customs officers have been authorized by federal statute to conduct suspicionless boardings of vessels for the purpose of checking their documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.068" offset="259807">The issue in this case is whether such boardings in inland waters constitute unreasonable searches or seizures.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.019" offset="287601">The facts of this case may be briefly summarized.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.486" offset="305469">At about 11:30 in the morning, in March, 1980, a patrolling Customs officer spotted a 40-foot sailboat equipped with a diesel engine, anchored about 18 miles inland, in the Calcasieu River Ship Channel, which is a waterway connecting the Gulf of Mexico to the Customs port of entry at Lake Charles, Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.915" offset="395225">The officer and those on board his boat had never before seen a sailboat in that waterway, which is traveled by large commercial vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.800" offset="434723">On the stern of the sailboat was the name of the vessel, the Henry Morgan II, and its hailing port, "Basilea", which it turns out is the Latin translation for Basel, Switzerland.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.671" offset="486236">Although the officer did not recognize the name "Basilea", he correctly believed that it denoted a foreign port.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.215" offset="520404">At this time, a large freighter was heading up the ship channel, and it created a huge wake that caused the sailboat to rock so violently back and forth that it appeared it was about to capsize.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.101" offset="571918">In fact, at one point the sailboat's mast actually touched the water, and its keel emerged from the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.301" offset="592711">The Customs officer called out to Respondent Hamparian, who was the only person visible on deck, and asked if he was all right, but Hamparian merely shrugged his shoulders, which suggested to the officer that he was unable to speak English.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.029" offset="651643">The officer then decided to board the vessel for the purpose of checking the documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.153" offset="672123">He did so, and while examining the documents, he detected the odor of burning marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.933" offset="695320">He also saw through an open hatch burlap-wrapped bales of what he believed was marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.508" offset="721547">The Respondents were then arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.711" offset="726354">The boat was searched.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.899" offset="731160">Fifty-eight hundred pounds of marijuana, with a street value of about $7 million, was seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.052" offset="755715">Respondents were convicted of drug offenses, but their convictions were reversed by the Court of Appeals on the ground that there was no reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, and therefore the officer was prohibited from boarding the vessel in inland waters for the purpose of checking the documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.981" offset="831470">With these facts in mind, it bears emphasis that the only authority at issue in this case is the authority to board the vessel and check the documents, and not the authority to search any other portion of the craft.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.711" offset="886432">It also bears emphasis that the Henry Morgan II was not a small American boat on an inland lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.943" offset="911301">It was a seagoing foreign vessel on a ship channel connecting the open sea with the Customs port of entry, and it was located just a relatively short distance from the open sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.687" offset="962292">Our position, of course, is that suspicionless boardings and inspections, whether on inland or Customs waters, are reasonable, and therefore do not violate the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.887" offset="1003147">It is strong evidence of their reasonableness that they were authorized by the First Congress, which of course proposed the Bill of Rights to the States, and they have been continuously authorized by statute ever since.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.647" offset="1058109">Why is this so?</text>
            <text syncTime="226.553" offset="1065737">First, because there is simply no other adequate alternative way of enforcing the documentation laws, and the documentation laws serve many vital functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.046" offset="1115683">They are the primary method of identifying vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.982" offset="1131461">They serve to regulate the entry and departure of persons and goods traveling by water.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.402" offset="1157165">They are used in collecting import and tonnage duties, in conserving natural resources, and promoting safe shipping and boating.</text>

            <text syncTime="866.158" offset="3624169">There are no other adequate means of enforcing the documentation laws besides suspicionless boardings.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.934" offset="3655307">In addition, because of the long history of pervasive federal regulation of most aspects of maritime activity, persons aboard vessels within the jurisdiction of the United States have a greatly reduced expectation of privacy, especially with respect to the vessel's documents.</text>

            <text syncTime="1621.444" offset="6645283">We have a 40-foot foreign vessel, I want to stress, located not very far from the coast, and although it is masquerading as a pleasure vessel, in fact, it is engaged in a very lucrative, although illegal, trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.439" offset="6701289">It is carrying a $7 million cargo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.454" offset="6709335">This is not a pleasure vessel, and a rule that tried to draw a distinction between pleasure vessels and commercial vessels would be subject to just this sort of abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.200" offset="6748310">People engaged in violations of the documentation laws would use the sort of vessels that are commonly employed for recreational purposes, and would document them for recreational use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.711" offset="6794390">The invasion of privacy involved in stopping a vessel and conducting a document check is significantly different from what is involved in conducting a discretionary vehicle stop on land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.488" offset="6841514">First, and probably most important, vessels simply do not play the same central role in the lives of the average person as a passenger car does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.717" offset="6882370">I suspect that most of the people in Court today used a passenger car this morning, and they will use one tonight.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.715" offset="6906403">I doubt that many people here used a vessel or will use one later in the day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.681" offset="6926256">Land vessels have not historically been subject to the same close regulation as... excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.179" offset="6960215">Land vehicles have not been subject to the same close supervision as vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.817" offset="6978814">In fact, the early statutes from which Customs authority derives specifically required probable cause or reasonable suspicion for searches on land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.892" offset="7019147">In sum, the important interests served by the documentation laws in our judgment far outweigh their minimal intrusion upon privacy interests, and for that reason Customs' long-standing authority to conduct suspicionless boardings and inspections should be sustained.</text>

            <text syncTime="1736.931" offset="7107232">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, Your Honors, the boarding of the Henry Morgan II was pursuant to 19 USC 1581.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.392" offset="7169090">This statute grants government agents broader powers of search and seizure than any statute which has previously come before the Court for constitutional consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.169" offset="7212244">It is even broader than the statute that was before the Court in Brignoni-Ponce, because in that particular situation there was at least a geographic limitation on the powers of border controls to conduct roving and random patrols and stops of vehicles near the border with Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.490" offset="7293537">There are absolutely no limitations within the statute on the powers of Customs agents to seize or search vessels and vehicles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.737" offset="7334497">The agents may stop, board, and search any vessel, any time, any place in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.092" offset="7359888">Therefore, the time, place, manner, and scope of the boarding and search of the vessel is left to the unbridled discretion of the agent in the field, which this Court has always considered as an evil in this type of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.696" offset="7422373">The holding of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal was that the reasonableness standard of the Fourth Amendment required that Customs agents possess a reasonable suspicion of a law violation before boarding a vessel in inland waters pursuant to 19 USC 1581.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.970" offset="7495412">There was a limitation on these broad powers that were placed... that Customs agents enjoyed placed on it by the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.575" offset="7529893">I think very definitely that the true nature of this particular patrol is important in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.009" offset="7559568">First of all, insofar as the facts are concerned, this patrol was instigated and executed because of information which a Customs agent had received on the prior day, on March 5th, 1980, that there were two vessels in the Hackberry, Louisiana, area laden with marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.815" offset="7634801">Pursuant to that information, this patrol was formed, which included not only U.S. Customs agents, but included Louisiana State Police narcotics agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.168" offset="7688195">In fact, this was not a mere administrative search for documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.119" offset="7708048">This was clearly an investigatory, a criminal investigatory search that was made in order to obtain evidence to substantiate a criminal prosecution.</text>

            <text syncTime="3616.118" offset="14624019">Here, if the Henry Morgan II had been a documented boat from Basilea, Louisiana, or Mississippi, or Alaska, it would have had exactly the same markings, and here, a Customs patrol in a Louisiana ship channel came across a boat that bore the outward markings of a landlocked country 5,000 miles away.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.422" offset="14705208">The hailing port was written in Latin, and although the vessel bore Swiss markings, it was actually of French registry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.137" offset="14736137">Because situations like this come up all the time, it is necessary to conduct a documentation check to determine whether any further procedures, including a full-scale border search, is appropriate.</text>
