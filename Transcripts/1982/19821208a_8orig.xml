            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="166858">We will hear arguments first this morning in No. 8 Original, the State of Arizona against the State of California and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.779" offset="209908">Mr. Boronkay, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

          <turn speaker="carl_boronkay" startTime="15.021" stopTime="295.464">
            <label>Mr. Carl Boronkay</label>
            <text syncTime="15.021" offset="226940">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I would like first to give a brief statement of the background of the case before commencing argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.578" offset="265078">This proceeding before the Court derives from a suit filed by the State of Arizona in this Court in 1952 to determine its rights to Colorado River water.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.178" offset="311472">That proceeding was heard by Special Master Simon Rifkind, who after lengthy hearings filed a report with the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.922" offset="350447">This Court's decision in 1963 allocated water among the states of Arizona, California, and Nevada.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.389" offset="388376">Also determined were the water rights of a number of federal establishments, principally five Indian reservations along the lower Colorado River.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.825" offset="430068">The key issue involving the Indian reservations was the measure of the Winters doctrine rights of the Indian reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.032" offset="466953">Master Rifkind determined that the proper measure was the practicably irrigable acreage of the reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.566" offset="501121">He then determined the acreage for each of the reservations, and allocated water in accordance with that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.522" offset="532886">This Court adopted Master Rifkind's determination of irrigable acreage and the water allocations, and in 1964 entered its decree implementing the 1963 decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.981" offset="586698">Thereafter, in 1977, in connection with a joint motion to enter a supplemental decree respecting the listing of present perfected rights, which matter was called for in Article VI of the 1964 decree, the five tribes of these reservations sought to intervene for the purpose of seeking additional water for the reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.697" offset="689620">In the following year, the United States filed a motion to amend the 1964 decree to seek additional water for each of the reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.075" offset="731103">These pleadings and the responsive pleadings of the State Parties were referred to Elbert P. Tuttle as Special Master to hear the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.410" offset="764435">Master Tuttle has held lengthy hearings, and has made a report which is filed before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.636" offset="797349">He has ruled that it was proper to reopen the original proceedings for the purpose of hearing claims that there exists additional irrigable acreage on the reservation than was presented in the initial proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.076" offset="859103">I refer to this as the reopening issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.307" offset="872060">Some refer to it as the omitted lands issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.020" offset="886897">He has ruled further that it was proper to hear claims of irrigable acreage for... based on boundary changes made by the Secretary of the Interior for the reservations subsequently to entry of the 1964 decree, and he ruled that the State Parties could not challenge whether the irrigable acreage claim was in fact within the boundaries of the reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.327" offset="996089">I will refer to this as the boundaries issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.629" offset="1009359">Finally, he has ruled that it was proper for the tribes to intervene as independent parties with their own counsel to make claims for additional water for the reservation, despite the claims... the defenses of the three states based on the Eleventh Amendment, and he permitted the United States to continue to make claims for additional water on behalf of each of the tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.568" offset="1117088">I will now address these three issues, and my colleague will address following certain issues, equitable and legal, related to reopening the case, and also discuss issues respecting Master Tuttle's findings with regard to practicably irrigable acreage.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.181" offset="1199531">With respect to reopening the case to hear claims that there existed additional irrigable acreage over that contended for by the United States in the original proceedings, Master Tuttle concedes at the outset that were these claims to be made in a different lawsuit, they would be subject to the bar of res judicata, that these claims are not indeed new claims, but were within the issues originally tried and determined some 20 years before.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.723" offset="1333696">He states, however, that Article IX of the decree--</text>

          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="295.464" stopTime="299.077">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="295.464" offset="1348638">Did he say it would be res judicata or law of the case?</text>

            <label>Mr. Carl Boronkay</label>
            <text syncTime="299.077" offset="1363162">--He stated it would be res judicata ware these claims to be made in another proceeding.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="303.501" stopTime="304.971">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="303.501" offset="1380820">Oh, I see.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carl_boronkay" startTime="304.971" stopTime="426.281">
            <label>Mr. Carl Boronkay</label>
            <text syncTime="304.971" offset="1386672">In this particular instance, he referred, to avoid that bar, he states that Article IX of the Court's decree permits the reopening of that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.620" offset="1429304">That article provides that any party may apply at the foot of the decree for its amendment or for further relief, and that this Court reserves jurisdiction for the purpose of entering any proper order in relation to the subject matter of the controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.131" offset="1499312">We submit that that language neither in its form nor its purpose allows a party to come back many years after final adjudication to reopen an issue on the basis of perhaps an error in trial judgment or what amounts to the splitting of a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.482" offset="1576739">This language of Article IX is found in major water adjudications, particularly equitable apportionment cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.219" offset="1615714">Its office and function is to permit the Court to modify a decree due to changed circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.063" offset="1647060">Its orientation is in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.466" offset="1656674">A changed condition which means the decree is no longer workable, which means it has to be modified to become workable.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.872" offset="1690319">We are aware of no case that has interpreted language such as this to allow a party to come back merely because he has a change of position, a different position that he feels he should have taken and could have taken in the original suit, and yet this is the position urged by the United States and adopted by Master Tuttle.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.987" offset="1774747">We submit that it is not only unprecedented, but it is unsound to accept this interpretation, for it obviously allows relitigation of issues finally determined, casts an intolerable burden on the courts, creates instability in judgments, and, of course, adds unnecessary costs to litigants.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="426.281" stopTime="438.669">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="426.281" offset="1871922">What do you suggest was the purpose in the original report and action of this Court in leaving some of these matters open for adjustments?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carl_boronkay" startTime="438.669" stopTime="494.705">
            <label>Mr. Carl Boronkay</label>
            <text syncTime="438.669" offset="1921451">The adjustment that I believe the Chief Justice refers to would be the boundary adjustments in Article II(D)(5) of the decree, and that is a specific provision that permits the reopening for a specific purpose, and I will indicate that the condition of reopening for that purpose has not been met in this case, but with regard to Article IX, that is... I might call it a phrase of art.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.408" offset="2040465">It is not just a bland, broad statement reserving jurisdiction for any purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.202" offset="2063661">It has a certain function to fulfill, and that is the modification of a decree for changes in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.818" offset="2098038">We submit that Article IX in no way permits a party merely to say that if he had a second chance he could do better, and that is the use being made of that article here.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="494.705" stopTime="512.498">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="494.705" offset="2145581">I suppose if the use of Article IX made here is acceptable, one of the states or the lower basin states... basin states, either one could ask to relitigate the division of water--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carl_boronkay" startTime="512.498" stopTime="537.982">
            <label>Mr. Carl Boronkay</label>
            <text syncTime="512.498" offset="2216843">Precisely.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.410" offset="2224471">Indeed, if Article IX may be read so broadly, and we don't think it should, there would be no reason for any party having an interest to come in and relitigate matters if they feel they have certain equities, or they believe they could do better.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.059" offset="2291031">Moreover, I believe there could be the periodic reopening of this case for claims of irrigable acreage.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="537.982" stopTime="539.995">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="537.982" offset="2318721">--This wouldn't be the last of it, either.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carl_boronkay" startTime="539.995" stopTime="633.366">
            <label>Mr. Carl Boronkay</label>
            <text syncTime="539.995" offset="2326767">Indeed, it would not.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.814" offset="2330110">I foresee future generations of United States Attorneys wanting to second guess their predecessors, and utilizing current technology, saying, indeed, we might have asked for a greater amount of irrigable acreage than was claimed 20 years earlier, and I don't see any place to stop that process.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.669" offset="2409522">Moreover, Article IX was proposed by Master Rifkind.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.110" offset="2427286">Master Rifkind made it clear in the record again and again that he was striving for a certainty so far as possible of water rights and finality of a decree, and he is the master that urged this terminology, and yet it would be used to undermine his purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.894" offset="2494368">Accordingly, we feel there was no basis for reopening the litigated matter which Judge Tuttle indicates was litigated, and Article IX provides no basis for relitigating some 20 years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.911" offset="2546404">If there are no questions, I will turn to the boundaries issue, if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.464" offset="2560615">With respect to the boundaries determination of Master Tuttle, we respectfully submit his treatment is no more defensible than with respect to the reopening issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.059" offset="2603038">It is to be recalled that the boundary issue was fully tried in the first litigation, that California protested that some of the boundaries being urged by the United States were wrong, that the irrigable acreage on parts of the Mojave and Colorado River Indian Reservations were outside the reservations, and therefore had no basis for a Winters doctrine water right.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="633.366" offset="2700318">Were the boundaries in dispute, all those that had federal lands on one side and tribal lands on the other?</text>

            <text syncTime="653.278" offset="2779939">And so, California in protesting these boundary determinations of the United States raised that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.566" offset="2821108">The United States joined in that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.967" offset="2830721">There was no protest to its being tried, and indeed it was fully tried, and for the most part, the boundaries were found to be incorrect.</text>

            <text syncTime="809.890" offset="3406355">Accordingly, this Court rejected the findings as to boundaries, but the matter might have been finished at that point with respect to irrigable acreage of each reservation, and as to the water allocation dependent on irrigable acreage.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.112" offset="3471243">I suggest that the doctrine of res judicata would have bound all the parties to the irrigable acreage determination had not the Court in II(D)(5) given the United States another chance, so to speak, an extra chance.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.942" offset="3534564">But I do not feel this Court intended by giving the United States the extra chance that it could determine those boundaries conclusively on the adverse party by unilateral action such as it has presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.903" offset="3598407">In this case, it relies on secretarial orders based on surveys of boundaries for approximately 90 percent of its boundary claim, and for approximately 10 percent it relies on four or five judgments, most of which are stipulated judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.836" offset="3674162">In neither of these situations are the parties adversely affected, the State Parties, given any opportunity to participate in the determination of those boundaries, and yet the United States says we are bound by those boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.013" offset="3734871">Our water rights are directly affected by those boundary determinations, which include or exclude irrigable acreage, and yet the United States comes forward and says it may unilaterally determine those boundaries for the purpose of modifying water allocations of these reservations which resulted from a complete adjudication with all adverse parties present.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.702" offset="3837585">We submit that that wasn't the intent of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.624" offset="3849287">It would be ironic indeed if the very boundaries that were tried and found to be incorrect before Special Master Rifkind were to be conclusively imposed upon the State Parties by virtue of having the stamp of approval of the Secretary of the Interior some years later.</text>

            <text syncTime="1236.343" offset="5112151">We don't feel that merely Secretarial action, administrative action, valid for administrative purposes, is the type of action or activity that should permit the United States unilaterally to come in and say, now, we can modify the water rights and you can't challenge it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1328.872" offset="5482254">We submit that 1362 doesn't relate at all to a waiver of sovereign immunity of the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.959" offset="5514646">Master Tuttle cites some three United States District Court cases which I submit badly misread the decision of this Court written by Mr. Justice Rehnquist in Moe versus the Salish and Kootenai tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.418" offset="5572429">That case permitted the Indian tribe to have the same position as the United States with respect to a statute that did not permit the United States District Court to issue an injunction against state enforcement of sales tax on the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.112" offset="5647243">The case reasoned that 1362 permitted the tribes to file a suit where the United States could have sued in their behalf and failed to do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="1547.735" offset="6357774">The first of which Mr. Boronkay addressed is boundary lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.597" offset="6373238">The second of which I would call consciously excluded lands, and which we have referred through this matter as omitted lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.473" offset="6400719">The states believe that they had finally litigated the matter of these excluded lands, and I think a review of the record will show that Master Rifkind also believed that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.951" offset="6446590">I will not take the time to quote, but I will paraphrase some comments from the United States Attorneys with respect to these lands to get it in our minds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.119" offset="6487237">Mr. Warner, the United States Attorney who tried the case, indicated to Master Rifkind that the decree will serve the purpose of res judicata for the maximum water for the reservations, and that there would be no claim for other lands on the reservations even though they may be irrigable, and he felt also, as he indicated, that it was his duty to prove to the full extent that he could the Indian water claims, and also that the maps which they put into evidence showing the irrigable lands constituted the United States bill of particulars with respect to the lands that they claimed to be irrigable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.063" offset="6643031">Now, we believe that this does not therefore describe inadvertent mistakes as the United States Attorneys now seek to label the efforts of the U.S. Attorneys in the 1950's.</text>

            <text syncTime="2088.281" offset="8519981">Nevertheless, evidence was presented in the context of the trial held below, and in the context of the equities involved to show that there was major reliance upon the decree which had been rendered by this Court in 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.743" offset="8589780">Indeed, Arizona came to this Court with the original action for the very purpose of finally and fully establishing its right to this water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.949" offset="8626561">They had been before the Congress many occasions seeking to obtain authorization for the Central Arizona Project, and had met with resistance, among the claims being that they did not have a final adjudicated right to the water involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.590" offset="8693121">And so, that was the very purpose in coming to the Court with the original action, to establish that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.413" offset="8712451">Since that time, they have obtained authorization through the Congress for the Central Arizona Project.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.008" offset="8738887">They have assessed taxes against their citizens in three of the counties to assure repayment of the reimbursible features of the project.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.763" offset="8777862">They have gone before the Congress and talking about sizing of the canal to deliver the water, and reliance upon the fact that there would be received the amount of water that was determined to be its remaining entitlement in this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.186" offset="8843586">And indeed the United States supported it before the Congress, indicating that it had a firm supply to its remaining entitlement, and therefore it could invoke the reclamation laws of the United States for purposes of building this project.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.285" offset="8903981">We submit to the Court that the preclusion doctrines to apply to this situation, and that it should affirm the 1964 decree as written, and return the parties to their stated reliance upon that decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.746" offset="8965839">On the other hand, if Article IX is broad enough to permit the reopening of the nature that occurred before Master Tuttle, then we submit that it is likewise broad enough to reopen for all purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.305" offset="9024040">And some of those purposes that were presented to Master Tuttle and rejected by him as not appropriate are the fact that this Court in the interim since 1964 decided two very important cases that defined further the reserved water rights doctrine, those cases being United States versus New Mexico and the State of Washington versus the Washington State Commercial Passenger Vessels Fishing Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.575" offset="9149114">The definitions and guidelines which were rendered by this Court in those two decisions, we submit, are that the reservation doctrine only reserves that amount of water which is for the primary purposes for which the reservation was created, and not for any secondary purposes which it may serve, and further, that though there may be a maximum reserve... reserved water, that the... that doesn't necessarily mean that the particular people involved will receive that full amount, but they will receive the amount of that scarce natural resource that is necessary to provide them with a moderate living.</text>

            <text syncTime="2364.053" offset="9622976">At the time we had arranged to go to the various Indian reservations to visit with them, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs to obtain records with respect to the leasing of lands and this kind of evidence, and of course that came to a halt when our motions were denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.881" offset="9682326">There is also a very practical problem that Arizona some day must face, and that is that there is so much Indian land in the state that if the practicable irrigable acreage standard is to be applied throughout the state, then the existing water supply could only supply one-third of the Indian reservation lands, and none of the non-Indian lands, and we feel that this issue, too, could be visited if the '64 decree is construed broadly enough to allow reopenings of the type that is sought for here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2635.781" offset="10709878">This Court may not wish to reweigh all of the evidence from this lengthy trial, but we did except to some of the findings of Special Master Tuttle, and as to the United States claims, the errors relate to the lands which even the United States experts projected to be only marginally profitable, but they based such projections on yields and production costs and power rates that we feel are not properly established in the evidence and resulted in a shifting of the burden of proof to the states rather than the Master requiring the burden of proof to be carried by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.804" offset="10858045">As to the Indian tribe claims, the errors, we submit, relate to lands which the Master found profitable, and thus deserving of a permanent water right based only on the projection of what we have termed exotic crops, crops without a commercial history, unproven in the area.</text>

            <text syncTime="2777.942" offset="11278616">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the tribes relied on the government's brief on the boundary dispute issue, and so I intend to defer that question to Mr. Claiborne, and proceed with the question of the omitted lands and the other issues raised by counsel for the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.994" offset="11350819">The states say that the 1964 decree can't be reopened because, one, res judicata bars it, two, Article IX does not authorize it, and three, the law of the case precludes it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.892" offset="11398362">We say they are mistaken on all three grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.513" offset="11408811">First, res judicata only applies to a subsequent case between the same parties in the same cause of action, a different case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2820.551" offset="11449039">Second, Article IX by its express terms certainly authorizes any change whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.445" offset="11480595">And third, we say the law of the case does not bar reopening where there has been a gross error which the states admit, where this error has caused manifest injustice to one of the parties, and there has been no significant showing of detrimental reliance upon the other party.</text>

            <text syncTime="2875.575" offset="11669095">Now, in their briefs and in this oral argument, they are contending that a major portion of that land would not have been irrigable at the original trial, but it is today, but the fact is, and the record shows, that the only change in technology that appears in the record concerns drip irrigation, and drip irrigation the states' experts contended could be substituted and replaced with, if it didn't work properly, sprinkler irrigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3295.051" offset="13346992">The same policy reasons which caused Judge Rifkind to say that we would determine the future needs of the tribes measured by irrigable acres exists today, because it provides the certainty which other water users needed, and you couldn't estimate how much the Indian population would increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.424" offset="13420553">Policy reasons are the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.385" offset="13428389">And the same applies to the other issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.829" offset="13446153">If there is a good reason to change, if it wouldn't hurt the other party, if it would do justice under the law of the case, you could do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.385" offset="13488367">What the... I think the states are arguing is that... or I should say what they are doing, I believe, is confusing the grounds for reopening with the standard to be used once reopened, it is determined that the decree should be opened.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.172" offset="13651475">Justice... Judge Tuttle found, and we agree that the mere fact there has been change in technology is no ground to reopen the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.906" offset="13686479">The mere fact that if we came into Court today and more acreage would be irrigable because of advanced technology is not a ground to reopen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.562" offset="13721065">It is only if we did not get a fair hearing at that time under those standards that were applied, but Judge Tuttle found that was ground for reopening.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.770" offset="13761921">But he said, now, having found grounds for reopening, he said, then it only makes sense to apply today's technology, because it would just complicate the case to go back and look at the technology in 1956 to '58.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.149" offset="13819390">Furthermore, the states never asked him to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.521" offset="13832869">The states put on no evidence as to the difference in technology between '60, 1960 and 1980, and they didn't ask the Master to make any findings about it, and they took no exceptions to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.609" offset="13881248">That issue should be out of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.441" offset="13892533">The only thing the states did was ask the Master to determine the technology at the time the reservations were created.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.016" offset="13918865">That's way back in 1865 or 1870.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.717" offset="13933702">The Master did reject that out of hand, but they never requested him to take into account the difference in technology between 1960 and 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.005" offset="13966825">The states suggest that there would be no injustice to the tribes because this Court approved of the Special Master's holding, Special Master Rifkind's holding that the acreage he found was reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.255" offset="14163789">But what this Court held was that</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.478" offset="14184687">"The various acreages of irrigable land which the Master found to be on the different reservations we find to be reasonable. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.753" offset="14217810">Now, the states suggest that what he is talking about is a determination that the number of acres found was reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.750" offset="14249784">We suggest what the Court... the Court had just previously said two sentences above, that the tribes were entitled to all the practicably irrigable acres on the reservation, and therefore that couldn't be what it intended, it must have intended merely to approve of the determination of irrigability of the acres that the Special Master awarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.343" offset="14336197">With respect to the timing of our motion and the state's claimed reliance, our motions were filed in 1977 and '78, 13 and 14 years after the decree, before there was any substantial certainty with respect to the present perfected rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.243" offset="14451762">Remember, the tribes were awarded 905,000 acre feet in the original case, less than one-seventh of the 7,500,000 acres awarded to the Lower Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.053" offset="14511008">But it wasn't until 1979 that over three-quarters of the present perfected rights were determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.278" offset="14543922">Now, present perfected rights have priority over all other rights, including the Central Arizona Project and the Metropolitan Water District, yet it wasn't until after the tribes' motions were filed that over three-quarters of the rights, of the present perfected rights were determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.680" offset="14613513">How, therefore, could Central Arizona Project and MWD find... place great reliance on the Indian allocation of '64?</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.825" offset="14650084">Second, there was huge uncertainty with respect to the amount of water in the Colorado River.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.390" offset="14676416">Even today the state of Arizona claims that there is an assured supply of water of 550,000 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.268" offset="14727929">They claim that there was 356,000 when they tried to get the Central Arizona Project going.</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.083" offset="14763142">In other words, Arizona told the Congress when they got the Central Arizona Project authorized that there was far less water than they now feel is available today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.853" offset="14818208">This is largely due to the fact that the Upper Basin states have not used the water as fast as was anticipated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3669.395" offset="14844435">Third, the states knew that the boundary disputes had not been determined, and that the tribes, if they won the boundary disputes, would be entitled to more water, so there was uncertainty with respect to even the additional Indian claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3686.018" offset="14910891">The Metropolitan Water District claims reliance, arguing that after the '64 decree, they went to their own water project and asked for additional water to take the place of the water they lost to Arizona, but they did not ask for any additional water for the water they lost to the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="3715.578" offset="15029069">They lost 550,000 acres feet to Arizona, and they lost 55,000 acre feet to the Indians, but they didn't ask their own California Water Project for that... to make up for the 55,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3730.986" offset="15090718">Now, today, in this case we are only asking for 16,000 additional acre feet for the Indians, or less than one-third of the 55,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3740.833" offset="15130110">Metropolitan Water District's excuse for not asking for the original 55,000 was that it was such a relatively minor amount, it was unnecessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3751.160" offset="15171488">Well, we suggest if they didn't bother to go after 55,000 acres and supplement it, is it reasonable to believe that they would think 16,000 was such an enormous amount that it would change their position?</text>
            <text syncTime="3762.828" offset="15218091">Furthermore, the Metropolitan Water District right now is using 1.3 million acre feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3771.504" offset="15252781">The 16,000 acre feet we are claiming is just a fraction more than 1 percent of their water, well within the range of estimating accuracy, the closest to which they claim they can estimate in the river is 10 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3787.363" offset="15316207">Finally, what the states are really complaining about is injury or impact rather than detrimental reliance, but even the injury they claim is not to the extent to which it is claimed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3802.343" offset="15376184">Take Arizona, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="3804.046" offset="15382976">The testimony of Wes Stryner, the director of the Land and Water Resources Department of the State of Arizona, said that the per capita use of water in Phoenix is over twice what it is in the city of Tucson, and the reason it is over twice as much is because of the watering of lawns, trees, and ornamental shrubs, and that if the people in Phoenix would reduce their water rate to be equivalent to Tucson, there would be more than enough water to satisfy all the additional land claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3837.445" offset="15516618">So, what does it come down to?</text>
            <text syncTime="3838.767" offset="15521842">Do the Indians get the water for agriculture on the reservation, or do the people of Phoenix get it for ornamental shrubs, if you want to talk about equities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3847.493" offset="15556742">Alternative intervention, for just a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3865.865" offset="15630303">I think that Maryland versus Louisiana is directly on point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3870.828" offset="15650156">I can't see any difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3872.019" offset="15654858">In that case, 17 pipeline companies intervened in the case of 30 cases... 30 states against another state and the United States against another state, the exact fact situation we've got here, except it's more stay.</text>

            <text syncTime="3922.603" offset="15857255">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, before turning to the boundary lines, it might be useful to say one or two words in addition to what has been said by Mr. Aschenbrenner about the omitted lands question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3936.361" offset="15912216">I would ask the Court to recognize that Article IX of the decree in this case is specific in allowing amendment and modification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3952.152" offset="15975433">The word "modification" when the provision was referred to was omitted by the State Parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3959.256" offset="16003854">It is that word on which we rely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3962.167" offset="16015452">Now, that term, "modification", is not the common standard provision in the original decrees of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3972.205" offset="16055576">It is, on the contrary, a special form of words which is common to water decrees, including the water decrees of this Court in interstate cases, such as Wisconsin versus Illinois and New Jersey versus New York, cited by the Special Master.</text>
            <text syncTime="3990.347" offset="16128197">In the ordinary original case in which this Court retains jurisdiction, such as the off-shore cases, beginning with the Louisiana and Texas cases, the order retaining jurisdiction is far more restrictive.</text>
            <text syncTime="4005.795" offset="16189950">In those cases, for instance, it read,</text>

            <text syncTime="4054.459" offset="16384615">--Justice O'Connor, certainly such provisions do typically address the question of changed circumstances, and for that reason they are appropriate in order decrees where predictability is not always as certain as it might be, but it also authorizes here the correction we suggest of mistakes and omissions, at least if they can be shown to be of sufficient magnitude to justify the exercise of the Court's discretion.</text>

            <text syncTime="4100.477" offset="16568726">I want to say one more thing about Article IX.</text>
            <text syncTime="4103.670" offset="16581474">It was not an inadvertent provision that was slipped in at the last moment without anyone's noticing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4110.144" offset="16607387">It was a provision written by the Special Master himself in his draft decree in May of 1960, this same Special Master who had held the United States to making all its claims, and who had indicated a reluctance to be ready to reopen, but perhaps not too surprisingly, although the Special Master pushed the government attorneys as far as he could to making their full claim, warned them that reopening was a closed door; nevertheless, when coming to writing his decree, perhaps thought to himself, I must, notwithstanding having pressed the government to making its full claim, allow for the event that I or they had made an error which justice requires to be corrected at some later date.</text>
            <text syncTime="4166.392" offset="16832354">It will, of course, be in the lap of the Court to determine whether that application will fail or not, but I ought not wholly close the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="4177.268" offset="16875926">That provision written by the Special Master in May of 1960, circulated to the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="4184.774" offset="16905914">Briefs were written commenting upon the decree, commenting upon the report.</text>
            <text syncTime="4190.999" offset="16930783">Oral hearings were held in New York for three days before the Special Master, before he finalized his report and recommended decrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="4199.874" offset="16966309">In none of those proceedings was any suggestion made that Article IX ought to be narrowed, specifically, narrowed so as to prevent a reopening of the Indian allocations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4211.742" offset="17013748">No word of that in any of these briefs, in any of these hearings.</text>

            <text syncTime="4244.844" offset="17146136">There were two lengthy oral arguments in this Court, and during all of that time, no party suggested that Article IX had been drawn too widely, too broadly.</text>
            <text syncTime="4257.313" offset="17196082">On the contrary, the only party to speak to Article IX was the Imperial Irrigation District, insisting upon it as the way of preventing any claim of res judicata should a mistake have occurred and correction be appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4277.714" offset="17277689">At all events, the Court issued its opinion in June of 1963, and then allowed the parties further time in which to prepare a decree modifying that which the Master had suggested in light of the Court's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4295.765" offset="17349891">That, of course, resulted in further briefing.</text>

            <text syncTime="5025.042" offset="20266933">--I appreciate that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5025.983" offset="20270695">I appreciate that that is so, though we invite the Court to follow the indications of its prior decision with respect to these boundary questions, remembering this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5044.977" offset="20346763">Were it not for the decree of this Court in 1964, water would presently be allocated to these boundary lands because there are final determinations administratively as to these boundaries, and because those lands have been determined to be irrigable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5063.508" offset="20420847">This Court enjoined the Secretary from granting water to such lands until either there was an agreement of the parties or this Court itself entered a further decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="5076.848" offset="20474241">What this Court did not suggest, indeed, suggested to the contrary, was that this Court would also review these administrative boundary determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5089.928" offset="20526486">On the contrary, as the Court well knows, at its previous hearing, the Court determined that the Special Master had wrongly in its name sought to determine the boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="5102.454" offset="20576641">The Court said that that matter would not be decided here, and even suggested that the Secretary was free to allocate water in the interim.</text>
            <text syncTime="5115.192" offset="20627527">The decree for some reason was inconsistent with the opinion in this respect, and on the contrary, instructed the Secretary not to deliver water to these contested boundary areas until they had been finally determined, in which event an application must be made to this Court to obtain water for such irrigable acreage as was found there.</text>
            <text syncTime="5140.659" offset="20729405">That is why we came to this Court, in obedience to the 1964 decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="5147.835" offset="20758140">We came late, in part because we wished to only come once.</text>
            <text syncTime="5153.248" offset="20779769">We waited until all the boundary determinations had been finalized, and indeed, as the Court knows, in one case the finalization occurred the day before we filed our motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5165.976" offset="20830760">We did not delay once we had in hand the final decisions of the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="5173.891" offset="20862420">Certainly the Court did not suggest on the last occasion that the United States must go out and get judicial vindication of secretarial orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="5189.302" offset="20923965">That would indeed be most unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="5191.824" offset="20934100">Those orders are final.</text>
            <text syncTime="5194.385" offset="20944340">This Court has indicated that it need not review them, and for good reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="5200.490" offset="20968791">This Court is not normally charged in original cases with reviewing administrative findings of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="5211.428" offset="21012468">If there are appropriate proceedings which can be had in some other court, and if a challenge in some other court should disallow any of these boundary adjustments, no harm will be done if in the meantime the water is allocated.</text>
            <text syncTime="5236.122" offset="21111315">The recommended decree provides that in the event that any boundary determination is upset judicially, the allocation made to that extent shall be diminished.</text>
            <text syncTime="5251.262" offset="21171815">The formula is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="5252.952" offset="21178607">There will be no need to reapply to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5256.485" offset="21192713">Now that the matter is before the Court, we urge the Court not to be sidetracked by a suit belatedly filed after the close of the evidence before the Master in the Southern District of California, but to take this opportunity to at long last allocate the water that has for many years properly been attributable to the boundary lands of these tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5287.346" offset="21316220">The Court ought not be asked to postpone its rulings, and the tribes ought not be asked to postpone their entitlement to this boundary land any further.</text>
            <text syncTime="5302.316" offset="21376092">With the exceptions which are not controversial filed by the United States, we urge the Court to approve in all respects the recommendations of the Special Master.</text>
