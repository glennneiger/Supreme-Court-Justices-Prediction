            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="149758">Thank you gentlemen, the case is submitted, we will hear arguments next in Minneapolis Star and Tribune against the Minnesota Commissioner of Revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.189" offset="186434">Mr. Brown, I think you may proceed when you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lawrence_c_brown" startTime="76.064" stopTime="326.795">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence C. Brown</label>
            <text syncTime="76.064" offset="453928">Mr. Chief Justice and Justices of this Honorable Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="81.285" offset="474826">The Appellant before you is Minneapolis Star and Tribune Company, locally known in Minnesota as Star and Tribune.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.974" offset="509621">It is the largest circulation daily newspaper in the State of Minnesota.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.228" offset="538669">This appeal presents two levels of issues which are essentially press clause First Amendment issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.435" offset="583495">The first issue, as we view it, is whether the State of Minnesota may tax publishers of Minnesota newspapers by imposing a tax on their consumption of paper and ink, or whether such a form of tax is prohibited by the press clause of the First Amendment in this Court's 1936 decision in the Grosjean case.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.907" offset="709301">Our view of that basic issue is that it is extremely narrow, it is essentially a revisiting of this Court's decision in Grosjean, and that the tax we challenge in terms of constitutional magnitude is factually indistinguishable from the stamp taxes in England and the colonies of Massachusetts and New York imposed during the 1700s.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.978" offset="845660">The second issue that we present assumes that we have lost on the first issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.685" offset="884426">The second issue is if such a use tax on paper and ink may constitutionally be imposed on the business of publishing newspapers, then is it still constitutional when the state of Minnesota, by enacting an annual $100,000 exemption which has the effect of imposing the tax only on approximately a dozen or so of Minnesota's large circulation daily newspapers and also has the effect of removing from the burden of the tax approximately 370 to 380 of Minnesota's other newspapers who simply do not consume on an annual basis $100,000 worth of paper and ink?</text>
            <text syncTime="241.039" offset="1113885">The background of the tax may be summarized briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.593" offset="1136037">In 1967, Minnesota for the first time adopted a sales and use tax program.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.680" offset="1164458">In 1971, through an exemption, the use tax here at issue was, for the first time, visited upon all Minnesota newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.875" offset="1225167">And from 1971 until January 1 of 1974, all newspapers in Minnesota who consumed paper and ink, and by definition since paper and ink are the only two physical components of a newspaper, they all did, they were all, therefore, subjected to the tax at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.103" offset="1306147">On January 1, 1974, by virtue of the annual $100,000 exemption and thereafter, during the timeframe that is at issue here, January 1, 1974 through May of 1975, which is the refund period for which this action was commenced in the Hennepin County District Court in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the only papers in Minnesota who paid the tax were the large circulation dailies.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.176" offset="1446372">And the Minneapolis Star and Tribune--</text>

            <text syncTime="333.568" offset="1483988">--Your Honor, according to the records submitted in support of Star Tribune's summary judgment motion, I think there were approximately 29 and 27.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.041" offset="1537905">I may be off a little bit in the numbers.</text>

            <text syncTime="357.183" offset="1578447">I think the Brainard Dispatch, Your Honor, is the one which in 1974 was not subject to the tax and in 1975 was, and it was at about 14 to 15 thousand a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.824" offset="1629020">Now, I may have those years backwards, but that's about the cutoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.959" offset="1641559">The procedural background in this case was that the action for the refund of approximately $875,000 of use taxes paid, was commenced in August of 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.952" offset="1701536">We are dealing here with a 17-month timeframe which is the defined period for which we sued to obtain a refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.074" offset="1738003">We proceeded to move the trial court for summary judgment, and in support of our motion we submitted a fact record consisting of affidavit testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.501" offset="1799756">There was also, as one of our fact showings, an affidavit from Mr. Shaw who ran the Minnesota Newspaper Publishers Association which sets forth the statistical basis identifying Minnesota legal newspapers and the relative circulations of those newspapers who do pay the tax, and the Minnesota Supreme Court has set forth in its formal opinion in this case the statistical data defining who was publishing newspapers and who was subjected to the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.491" offset="1935698">The trial court granted summary judgment for Star Tribune on all constitutional issues presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.478" offset="1963596">At the oral argument before the trial court, the state orally moved for summary judgment on the basis of the fact records submitted by Star and Tribune.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.255" offset="2018767">And I pause to note that point, because we are here before this Court challenging the judgment of the Minnesota Supreme Court which reversed the trial court, with the same identical fact record that we had at the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.866" offset="2089193">And that was a fact record which the state adopted as its own in support of its motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.555" offset="2127959">The state has never submitted any factual showing that would in any way indicate that the factual record submitted by Star Tribune was not a thorough and accurate record on which this case may be adjudicated.</text>

            <text syncTime="1774.575" offset="7247959">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.895" offset="7273245">In 1971, the state of Minnesota was engaged in fashioning one of its most important social and political programs in its history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.168" offset="7310339">The result was a comprehensive tax and financial reform act which took up over 116 pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.904" offset="7333327">Over half of this volume of the Minnesota Special Session laws for that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.856" offset="7349105">Enacted as part and parcel of this law and yet taking up only one-half of a page in it, was the basic use tax on paper and ink that we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.479" offset="7387662">Now, all one has to do is to read this large tax reform measure in order to understand that its basic purpose was revenue raising, its basic purpose was a social program of creating more equal educational opportunities for Minnesotans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.591" offset="7456102">The basic thrust of the 1971 law, of which the basic use tax here was a part, was to lower the overall property tax burdens in Minnesota which were very high at the time, and to make up for the subsequent loss in revenue through increasing the statewide income tax and the statewide sales and use tax, and then to redistribute that revenue back to the local governments and particularly, back to local school districts for the purpose, the avowed purpose, of equalizing educational opportunity throughout Minnesota at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.645" offset="7584311">It was an important social experiment in Minnesota and it happened to be a successful one, at least in the early 1970s when it became popularly known as the Minnesota Miracle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.685" offset="7624436">This legislative background, which we feel the appellant has given inadequate treatment to, as well as the statutory language of this tax on its face shows that Minnesota's use tax on paper and ink, the basic use tax, is purely and simply a revenue-raising measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.129" offset="7686189">No other purpose either has been or can be ascribed to it under this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.764" offset="7704788">This history as well as the statutory language also shows that Minnesota's use tax on paper and ink is an integral part of a general system of taxation, and that it is tied to the general sales and use tax rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.972" offset="7753585">In 1971 it was imposed at the same sales and use tax rate, 4 percent, as all other sales and use taxes in Minnesota.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.245" offset="7786708">And today it is still tied to that same general rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.030" offset="7801859">Therefore, the rate of tax upon paper and ink cannot be increased without also raising the rate upon all other businesses subject to the sales and use tax in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.319" offset="7834982">I think it's also important to point out that this legislative history and the statutory language on its face shows that this tax was imposed at the lesser wholesale value of the paper and ink and not at its retail value when it's finally incorporated into the final product.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.181" offset="7902378">Which would have been the case if a general sales tax had been imposed upon all newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.418" offset="7923381">I think the Minnesota legislature back in 1971 was seeking to achieve a revenue-raising purpose and tailored its statute so as to achieve that revenue-raising--</text>

            <text syncTime="1969.585" offset="8028080">Instead, we contend it was for another purpose, and that purpose was to establish this taxing scheme as being more equitable, taking into account the special problems dealt with by small publishers through a device, I would point, which is an exclusion that applies equally and with the same benefit to even the large publishers across the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.482" offset="8111671">This history, as well as the statutory language, also points out... and especially the statutory language, in response to Justice White's question of the appellant... is that this does apply to all publications across the board... publications as they are defined in the Minnesota statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.360" offset="8183142">When Minnesota first enacted its sales and use tax in 1967, it did not exempt all printed matter per se, even though all printed matter, obviously, is subject to First Amendment protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.101" offset="8238104">Instead, it created a specific class of printed matter which it deemed to be publications, and that definition of what consists of publications is printed matter which is set out at intervals of three months or less.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul R. Kempainen</label>
            <text syncTime="3164.216" offset="12806607">Well, I think that would be a closer case, Your Honor, and I can only say that it's not the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.036" offset="12829804">And I would hesitate to speculate on what would be the outcome of that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.424" offset="12843387">With regard to the equal protection issue, this was given some space in the briefs, and I think rightly so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.195" offset="12886437">I'd like to mention that our primary position here, as it has been throughout this litigation, is that the anti-rational basis standard of review is the correct standard of review here to use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.735" offset="12924680">This is because the thing being taxed, the wholesale commercial purchase of paper and ink, is simply not a fundamental right so closely connected to actual communicative acts that it requires the strict scrutiny standard of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.376" offset="12971178">There's certainly no more of a fundamental right than the Star and Tribune's purchase of gasoline or tires for its delivery trucks, which are subject to the excise tax, or its purchase of desks and reporters, desks and typewriters for its reporters, which has always been subject to sales and use taxation in Minnesota in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.404" offset="13039306">Any business that buys desks and typewriters for its people, for its employees, has to pay sales tax on those desks and typewriters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.741" offset="13064697">This is simply an incidental burden, an incidental item of overhead, just like those other incidental items, that any commercial business has to absorb in the state of Minnesota and, indeed, in all other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.716" offset="13112553">Therefore, we feel that it's sufficiently remote from actual communicative acts so that where we don't deny that it may have some effect upon First Amendment interests, it is not a fundamental effect invoking strict scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.042" offset="13165843">But having said that, I think I still want to go on and talk about how this case can meet the strict scrutiny standard of review in any event, because if it meets strict scrutiny, it certainly meets the anti-rational basis standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.516" offset="13211818">All the strict scrutiny standard of review requires is that there be a legitimate and important government purpose served by a statute which is sufficiently tailored so as to achieve that purpose without unduly restricting First Amendment interests and actual communicative acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.276" offset="13278796">Now, the original and basic use tax in this case is so tailored.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.447" offset="13295515">It serves... it was enacted in 1971 to serve an important and fundamental governmental interest, which is revenue raising for an important social program, and it is sufficiently tailored so as to get as far away from the actual communicative act of printing and publishing a newspaper as possible, and at the same time achieve its revenue-raising purpose by taxing the wholesale purchase of paper and ink.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.645" offset="13392272">As for the $100,000 exclusion, of course, our first position there is that it's a benefit anyway, and it's a benefit that applies equally and across the board to all publications.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.334" offset="13431038">In fact, the Star and Tribune, by reason of the fact that during the years in question it had two editions, the morning edition and the evening edition, it received two exclusions, getting a benefit of $8,000 off its tax bill.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence C. Brown</label>
            <text syncTime="3513.775" offset="14204785">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.275" offset="14210845">Justice O'Connor, you ask Mr. Kempainen whether there have been any changes in the Minnesota sales and use tax scheme since this litigation commenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.749" offset="14252746">The legislative session which just ended a few weeks ago increased the basic sales tax rate in Minnesota to 6 percent on all articles that sell for more than 9 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.442" offset="14315440">They left the sales tax rate on farm machinery at 4 percent, and the sales and use tax on motor vehicles at 5 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.548" offset="14347936">I point this out simply to note that there is no comfort in the state's argument of uniform rate, because the legislature has now broken it down and rates are no longer uniform.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.839" offset="14397046">The other point I'd like to make is Mr. Kempainen stated that you must find bad motive in order to invalidate the tax at issue, and what you do is you look to legislative history in order to establish bad motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.015" offset="14453784">Well, we don't think bad motive is material to a First Amendment analysis, but the state of Minnesota here has created a situation where we have no legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.721" offset="14492550">If Mr. Kempainen's approach is correct, what it means is that by not creating legislative history, a state can insulate a tax on First Amendment activity, and if bad motive is a requisite of proof you can never prove it; therefore, you can never challenge it.</text>
