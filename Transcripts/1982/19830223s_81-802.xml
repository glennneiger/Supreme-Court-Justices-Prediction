            <text syncTime="9.666" offset="130954">The first of these cases, 81-802, City of Lockhart against the United States involves a Voting Rights Act of 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.747" offset="175258">It is here from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, Appellant, a small community in Texas, changed its form of Government in 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.540" offset="226353">The new charter provided for a mayor and four councilmen replacing a mayor and two commissioners, the various proceedings after various proceedings not irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.345" offset="281629">The District Court held that the new charter was subject to Section 5 of the Act and concluded provisions for numbered post and staggered post that had a discriminatory effect on protected minorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.497" offset="350278">The District Court did not consider whether the plan also had a discriminatory purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.006" offset="376296">We agree that Section 5 required preclearance of the entire plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.246" offset="401269">We do not agree that it had a discriminatory effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.353" offset="417674">In 1976, in Beer against the United States, we held that Section 5 applies only to changes in voting procedures that have a retrogressive effect on minority voting strength.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.768" offset="487264">Applying the principle of our decision in Beer, we hold that the use of numbered post and staggered terms in the city's new plan will not have a retrogressive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.219" offset="541077">Accordingly, we vacate the decision of the District Court and remand the case for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.046" offset="576394">Justices Marshall and Blackmun have filed opinions concurring in part and dissenting in part.</text>
