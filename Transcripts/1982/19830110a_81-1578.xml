            <text syncTime="65.250" offset="398996">This case presents two distinct issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.845" offset="413416">First, whether ERISA, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, preempts the New York State Human Rights Law to the extent that law prohibits discrimination in employee benefit plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.666" offset="476736">The second issue is whether ERISA preempts the New York State Disability Benefits Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.526" offset="504113">The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found both laws preempted, a result never intended by Congress and at odds with the language of ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.175" offset="546745">Turning first to the Human Rights Law, the dispositive language is in Section 514(d) of ERISA.</text>

            <label>Ms. Deborah Bachrach</label>
            <text syncTime="123.447" offset="631799">ERISA, Section 514(a), provides that ERISA supersedes state laws which relate to employee benefit plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.272" offset="675163">Section 514(d) directs that that language shall not be construed so as to alter, amend, modify, invalidate, impair, or supersede any law of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.843" offset="745380">To preempt the New York State Human Rights Law would impair Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.589" offset="772338">A review of the legislative history and the statutes makes clear the inter-relationship between the state fair employment laws and the federal fair employment law and shows that to preempt the New York Human Rights Law would, indeed, impair that statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.410" offset="855721">Title VII was enacted in 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.329" offset="875365">At that time, more than half the states had fair employment legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.280" offset="899189">Congress examined the statutes in the states and designed the federal scheme to supplement the state statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.884" offset="941612">In fact, the role of the state proceedings in the Title VII scheme was so integral that Senator Humphrey was lead to describe Title VII as a states' rights or states' responsibility bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.285" offset="1007127">The importance of a multi-remedy approach to eradicating employment discrimination was reiterated in 1972 when Title VII was amended to correct certain deficiencies in the statute and to strengthen the national policy against employment discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.571" offset="1104302">Again, the importance of a multi-remedy approach on the state level, on the local level, and on the federal level to eradicate employment discrimination was reiterated.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="253.035" offset="1150173">Now, the Solicitor General, as I understand it, has suggested that what all of this means is that ERISA would invalidate New York's substantive law, but not its procedural law, if you will.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.218" offset="1214957">Would you address yourself to that at some point in your discussion?</text>

            <text syncTime="274.416" offset="1235646">As I understand the Solicitor's suggestion, he is saying that this Court need only reach the situation where New York law provides more protection than state law, but need not reach that situation where the protections are identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.081" offset="1318402">However, ERISA permits no such distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.062" offset="1342330">It does not support the Solicitor General's approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.157" offset="1358630">ERISA seeks to impairing any federal law and it would impair Title VII equally if the New York Human Rights Law were preempted to the extent it went beyond Title VII or to the extent it provided identical protections and in procedural protection.</text>

            <text syncTime="335.862" offset="1481510">We don't suggest the New York law is a federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.550" offset="1496243">What we suggest is that when Congress developed the Title VII scheme, the foundation was the state laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.233" offset="1526963">Congress was aware, and has always been aware, that state laws were not identical to the federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.731" offset="1556952">And, in fact, it discussed New York law in 1964 and noted that New York's protections were greater than those being offered by Title VII and Congress intended the states' law to survive, to be utilized as part of the Title VII process; to give states the opportunity to apply their laws first, and, indeed--</text>

            <text syncTime="377.266" offset="1647127">You can say that, and you are perfectly correct so far as Title VII is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.108" offset="1670428">Title VII did intend state laws to survive and to be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.748" offset="1689027">But, I think it is a different question to say that that made the state laws that were allowed to survive the federal law.</text>

            <text syncTime="413.520" offset="1792158">That is obviously the first step of our analysis, but it was intended to go beyond.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.063" offset="1818281">When Congress designed Title VII, it intended the states to go beyond Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.121" offset="1838552">Title VII provided only the minimum protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.918" offset="1849732">So, if this Court preempts the New York law to the extent it goes beyond Title VII, small employers in this country will face no prohibitions against employment discrimination, because Title VII only covers employers with more than 15 employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="527.175" offset="2246689">May it please the Court, at the lunch break, I was discussing the 1978 Pregnancy Amendment to Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.142" offset="2278558">At that time, both the Senate report and the House report make clear that Congress assumed that state laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of pregnancy were in effect and would remain so after the Pregnancy Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.226" offset="2354941">The House report and the Senate report examined the experiences of employers in states prohibiting discrimination on the basis of pregnancy and more than 23 states have laws prohibiting such discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.390" offset="2427561">And, based on that, on the experience at the state level, both the Senate and the House reports concluded that the economic impact of these pregnancy amendments would not be unduly burdensome, because employers in more than 23 states were already under state law obligation to provide equal benefits for pregnancy and related medical conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.988" offset="2534036">Now, this is particularly significant since the major impact of the Pregnancy Amendment was in the context of employee benefit plans, medical plans, health plans, disability plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.704" offset="2584818">The co-sponsor of the Pregnancy Amendment were Senators Williams and Javits, who were two of the principal architects of ERISA and it is never doubted for a moment in 1978 that state laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of pregnancy were in effect and would remain so in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.443" offset="2683770">In fact, Senator Williams described these amendments as reinforcing state laws prohibiting employment discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.813" offset="2721282">ERISA, the legislative history to ERISA, in 1974 also underscores that Congress intended state laws prohibiting discrimination in employee benefit plans, all state laws to remain in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.309" offset="2795261">ERISA does not include a non-discrimination provision, although in the debates it was stated on more than one occasion that discrimination in benefit plans was to be considered one of the most serious forms of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.145" offset="2858581">Members of the House and Senate were dissuaded from offering a non-discrimination amendment to ERISA only upon being reassured by ERISA's sponsors that Title VII non-discrimination provisions would be fully applicable.</text>

            <text syncTime="813.465" offset="3391897">Not only does Title VII saves state laws, but it utilizes those state laws and it encourages the states to go further.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.931" offset="3425752">The Solicitor General seems to suggest that this Court could come up with a workable preemption formula which would save state laws that are identical to Title VII and only preempt state laws which provide greater protection than Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.407" offset="3499626">We would suggest that there is no workable formula because identity of statutory language does not mean that the state law and the federal law give the same protection and this case amply demonstrates that, because in 1976, New York State's Human Rights Law forbid discrimination on the basis of pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.538" offset="3592204">Excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.287" offset="3595130">In 1976, New York State's Human Rights Law prohibited sex discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.162" offset="3614669">In 1976, Title VII prohibited sex discrimination, but in December 1976, this Court and the New York Court of Appeals reached contrary conclusions as to whether or not that prohibition against sex discrimination included discrimination on the basis of pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.873" offset="3693559">So, if we try to fashion some formula which says which state laws fall on which side of the line, we are confronted with quite a problem, or, better yet, the EEOC would be confronted with a problem, because every time the complaint of discrimination in a fringe benefit plan was filed with EEOC, before it could decide whether to defer to the state agency, as it is required to do by Title VII, it would first have to determine what state law said on the subject of this type of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.127" offset="3814558">It would then have to decide what federal law said on this type of discrimination and only if state law and federal law were identical could it then defer to the state agency.</text>

            <text syncTime="1003.890" offset="4153628">However, we would suggest it is impossible to make any dividing line between what appears to be the same language in theory and in practice how state courts and the federal courts have interpreted that language which may not always be the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.818" offset="4229278">If New York State's Human Rights Law is preempted, the EEOC would be unable to defer any complaints of employment discrimination in benefit plans to state agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.420" offset="4303675">That would mean that the caseload of EEOC would rise dramatically.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.619" offset="4328544">It would also mean that the caseload of the federal courts would rise dramatically since the EEOC has no authority to order the employer to provide any relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.598" offset="4376400">So that all victims of discrimination in employee benefit plans must now go through a court system, a federal court system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.972" offset="4405971">And, the administrative agency process that would ease the burden on victims of discrimination would be eliminated by preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.250" offset="4438989">This is contrary to the decisions of this Court which have taken pain to preserve state authority in the area of employment discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.948" offset="4489876">Just last term in the Kremer case this Court looked at the relationship between state laws and federal laws in this area and it noted the importance of state proceedings to federal law in the area of employment discrimination and as a result of that this Court held that state judgments, state court judgments, in the area of employment discrimination were entitled to full faith and credit in the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.405" offset="4615682">Any other decision would have violated basic tenants of federalism and would have served to decrease the incentive for states to develop effective and meaningful employment discrimination systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.634" offset="4672524">I cannot think of anything that would serve to reduce the incentive on states to develop effective and meaningful employment discriminations than to say that states may not prohibit discrimination in any employee fringe benefits, child care, health benefits, pension benefits, training programs, apprenticeship programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.546" offset="4768237">The state system would be effectively torn down by not allowing us to prohibit those forms of discrimination which have proved to be problematic on the state level, but have not yet risen to the level of a national problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="1484.924" offset="6077703">And, I think that is demonstrated by the literal reading suggested by the airlines here which is to focus on the purpose for which the employer is providing disability benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.904" offset="6125664">The airlines suggest that that purpose can be gleaned from the type of benefits provided and if employers provide benefits beyond what is required by state law, then the employer is not maintaining a plan solely for the purpose of complying with state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.648" offset="6192642">If we follow that out, an employer who maintains less benefits than is required by state law or no disability benefits at all, is also not maintaining a plan solely for the purpose of complying with state law, because, indeed, that employer is not complying with state law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1595.539" offset="6520217">May it please the Court: In this case we have a situation which one would hope would be more usual where the statutory language is thoroughly consistent with the legislative history which is thoroughly consistent with the policies sought to be effectuated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.123" offset="6602555">It is clear that Congress was keenly aware of the fact that all federal taxpayers have a stake in employee benefit plans through federal economic encouragement plans, either through delayed and preferential taxation or through tax policies allowing certain benefits to employees to be totally free of tax to the employee although deductible to the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.426" offset="6707776">It is also clear that Congress adopted a policy that lead to the statute, ERISA, designed to encourage the voluntary establishment, growth, and expansion of private employee benefit plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.027" offset="6770157">It is clear that Congress believed that one way to foster and encourage the growth and development of employee benefit plans was to give the plan designers and participants the maximum possible flexibility consistent with other federal laws in selecting and allocating the resources available for employee benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.018" offset="6866078">It is clear that Congress believed the plan should be allowed to be administered uniformly throughout all of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.748" offset="6900978">It is clear that Congress believed that the plan should be allowed to be uniform and equitable among their participants throughout all of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.994" offset="6946013">It is clear that Congress believed that without preemption of state laws, interstate plans could not maintain uniformity and equity among participants throughout the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.035" offset="7006199">It is clear that Congress thought that state laws affecting employee benefit plans might result in slowing down the growth or even the possible elimination of some employment benefit plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.109" offset="7058444">It is clear that Congress believed that the federal government's interest in employee benefit plans was comprehensive and pervasive and it is clear that Congress believed that this pervasive federal interest required, with certain narrow exceptions, the displacement of state action in the field of private employee benefit plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.159" offset="7162621">It is clear the Congress intentionally, and after full debate on a specific point, passed a preemption provision intended, as one senator said,</text>

            <text syncTime="1775.200" offset="7238794">All of this resulted in Section 514(a) of ERISA which states:</text>

            <text syncTime="2317.803" offset="9409256">ERISA does, indeed, provide specific exemptions of its sweeping preemption provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.000" offset="9437990">It provides specific exemptions for state security laws, state insurance laws, state banking laws, and relevant state criminal laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="2354.832" offset="9557318">It is here, we are told, that Congress intended to exempt state fair employment practice laws from exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.799" offset="9589187">Are the state federal employment practice laws exempted from preemption by the fact that no federal laws are changed?</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.904" offset="9625654">The argument is that it is not since Title VII provides that all state laws not in conflict with it are not affected by it, all state laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.320" offset="9675287">And, since it is a federal law not altered by ERISA, its provision disclaiming any effect on state law not in conflict with it is not altered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.317" offset="9719277">And, it is also argued that the state FEP laws have become federal laws because of their involvement in the enforcement scheme of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.393" offset="9751564">Federal laws in the securities, insurance, and banking areas all also contain similar provisions disclaiming any intent to preempt state laws in those areas, but Congress nevertheless specifically excepted state laws in these areas from the preempted provisions of ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.274" offset="9835156">The Title VII language is not specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.008" offset="9846023">It states that Title VII does not relieve any person from any liability, duty, penalty or punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.878" offset="9877579">The ADEA contains a similar provision, yet its legislative history makes it abundantly clear that its sponsors believed that all state FEP laws relating to age discrimination were preempted by ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.151" offset="9938601">Since the language in the enforcement scheme is indistinguishable for Title VII, this would seem to be conclusive evidence of the import and effect of the language in ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.818" offset="9985308">Appellants argue in their reply brief that the ADEA is different because that federal law contains a provision that age considerations are allowed under federal law in connection with the structure of employee benefit plans and, therefore, the federal law would not be altered by the preemption of state laws pertaining to age consideration in employee benefit plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.577" offset="10084364">With all respect, it seems to Appellees that the argument misses the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.777" offset="10109128">The policies of employee benefit plans under consideration today were also fully allowed under federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.775" offset="10141102">There was no conflict whatsoever with Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.505" offset="10152074">In both the case of Title VII and ADEA, the policy in question would be fully legal under federal law and the preemption provision of ERISA would apply to any state law related to an employee benefit plan including the age aspects as well as any other aspect of any such state/federal employment practice law relating to any employee benefit plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.682" offset="10256772">If the State of New York decided, Justice Stevens, that a policy of fixing benefits for retirement at an employee's normal retirement age, a policy allowed under federal law, violated the age provision of the Human Rights Law and proceeded to enforce such a decision, the defense would be the preemption provision of ERISA, the provision preempting all state laws relating to employee benefit plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.139" offset="10374637">It is also clear that the integrated scheme of Title VII relates only to enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.466" offset="10403894">An employee complaining about the policy of the Appellees in this case would not have had the EEOC defer to the State of New York because the employee benefit plans of the Appellees were consistent with federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.803" offset="10465229">The person might have been referred to the State of New York since there was no federal violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.705" offset="10492815">Cooperation exists where federal and state requirements are congruent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.986" offset="10509951">The EEOC is not allowed to defer if state law does not adequately cover the complaint and it does not defer, although it may refer, where a federal law does not cover the action complained of.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.526" offset="10572123">The scheme involves cooperation in the enforcement of a federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.008" offset="10594065">Similarly, the requirement that the EEOC accord substantial weight to the findings of state agencies relates only to factual determination and not to conclusions of law concerning the substantive provisions of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.299" offset="10655192">None of the cases relied on by the Appellants involves questions of substantive law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.390" offset="10679643">Mr. Kremer lost his case in this case Court because he could not, under a state law, found by this Court to be at least as broad as the federal law, convince the state agency of the facts necessary to support his claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.211" offset="10746829">If New York amended or modified its law, would that modify, alter, amend, or impair Title VII?</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.381" offset="10779535">If the substantive bonding and integration existed such as suggested by the Appellants, such an action would necessarily modify Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.671" offset="10824674">But, Title VII would be unchanged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.015" offset="10834078">Whatever action violated federal law would be the same both before New York amended its law as well after New York amended its law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2817.486" offset="11407936">Title VII leaves virtually all state laws intact, but the fact that it leaves all state laws intact does not transmute those state laws in federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.842" offset="11461435">If it does, where is the boundary?</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.152" offset="11474601">Title VII leaves all state laws providing a penalty or imposing a duty intact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.146" offset="11506575">What about other state laws relating to employee benefit plans?</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.412" offset="11523711">Do any filing or reporting requirements apply?</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.551" offset="11536250">Surely a penalty is provided for failure to file a report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.299" offset="11551192">Do the state fiduciary dues apply, state limitations on investments?</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.610" offset="11572508">Title VII's procedural and enforcement scheme is for the joint enforcement of federal law and it is comprehensive and demonstrates considerable confidence in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.261" offset="11619110">The enforcement scheme does not somehow serve as a talisman to convert the state's substantive rules into federal laws so as to preserve them from ERISA preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.054" offset="11666235">Here, the choice made on the allocation of benefits was permitted under federal law and was not permitted under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.958" offset="11697896">There was no partnership in connection with these plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.331" offset="11711375">There would have been no deferral.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.907" offset="11717644">There was no integration, there was no reliance, there was no overlap.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.043" offset="11738229">The Appellees, therefore, submit that it must be concluded from a legislative history, the plain language of the statute, and the policies sought to be effected, that Congress intended to preempt all state laws relating to employee benefit plans; that it was fully aware of the broad nature of the language it selected; that it knew that some statutes might be preempted which had not been specifically considered; and that it nevertheless made a considered judgment to preempt all law relating to employee benefit plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.825" offset="11881380">It had some concern that attention might be needed to deal with specific problems in the future because of this blanket approach and it therefore created a commission specifically charged to study the effects of preemption among other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.743" offset="11945014">It cannot be denied that Congress was fully aware of the comprehensive nature of this provision and nevertheless decided that the public and the nation would be better served by having only federal standards apply in this relatively narrow area in order to encourage the growth of plans as well as the expansion of plan benefits without whatever inhibiting or chilling effects which would or might result from state involvement through the application of any law relating to an employee benefit plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.494" offset="12088061">Insofar as the Disability Benefit Law is concerned, the state cannot claim that the employee benefit plans of the Appellees are free from ERISA coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.720" offset="12140932">The exception in the statute for Disability Benefit Laws is clearly related to plans not subject to the coverage of ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.372" offset="12195476">This is a coverage definition and the exception is to ERISA coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.152" offset="12218673">It has been suggested that while the Appellees plans may not be exempt from ERISA coverage, nevertheless, certain paragraphs or portions of the employee benefit plans are exempt from coverage and, therefore, because they are exempt from the coverage of ERISA, are subject to state regulation within the exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.580" offset="12312400">ERISA, however, indicates that the term "plan" refers to an integral unit or program, not to isolated and subsidiary provisions of a plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.262" offset="12351061">It has also been suggested that a ruling following the plain language of the statute would require a determination as to whether or not a plan is maintained solely to comply and that this would impose an impossible intent test on the statute which would in turn allow wide-spread avoidance of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.630" offset="12440505">Even if it could be assumed that employers would seek to be regulated by ERISA instead of the state, there is no reason to conclude that a purpose or intent test is so difficult to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.171" offset="12498705">Many federal statutes now have such tests, securities laws, criminal laws, anti-trust laws to name but a few.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.791" offset="12529216">The determination of purpose is not only required by the statute, there is no reason to anticipate any undue burden in this application.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.974" offset="12565892">The Appellees submit that the question for determination by this Court is does ERISA preempt state statutes that regulate the nature of the benefits an employer must provide in his ERISA regulated employee benefit plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.841" offset="12637363">The Appelles submit that this Court should find that a state statute that eliminates or adds to an ERISA covered employee benefit plan features that are committed or not required by federal law is preempted by Section 514 of ERISA.</text>

            <text syncTime="3151.488" offset="12743943">The Appellees argue that the Human Rights Law is preempted in its entirety to the extent it seeks to prohibit discrimination in employee benefit plans and that that would not impair Title VII because Title VII envisioned a joint enforcement scheme between the state and the federal government only to enforce federal law, but that simply is not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.510" offset="12844044">The deferral provisions of Title VII were for the state agencies, the state fair employment agencies, to apply state laws in their entirety so that if a complaint of race discrimination in a medical plan was first filed with EEOC, the EEOC would defer immediately to the state agency to allow the state to apply its law in its entirety without any preliminary determination of whether, in fact, the state law might provide greater protection under the rubic of race discrimination than would federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.589" offset="12996390">Title VII envisioned state enforcement of state law in the area of employment discrimination.</text>
