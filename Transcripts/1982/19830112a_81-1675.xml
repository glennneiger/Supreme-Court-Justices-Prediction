            <text syncTime="69.544" offset="405855">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="71.262" offset="412751">This case turns on your determination of the breadth of the first clause of 42 U.S.C. Section 1985(2), a Reconstruction Era civil rights statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.487" offset="469594">The case arises from the alleged mistreatment of a white college football player by his coaches.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.526" offset="501776">Respondent Kevin Rutledge attended Arizona State University in 1977 and 1978 and played intercollegiate football.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.032" offset="539811">The Petitioners are Frank Kush, his former coach, two assistant coaches, and Arizona State University's former athletic director.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.356" offset="581084">After Mr. Rutledge left Arizona State University and transferred to the University of Nevada at Las Vegas, he filed a claim with the Arizona Board of Regents reciting a veritable chamber of horrors to which he had been exposed while a student athlete at Arizona State.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.735" offset="658616">The filing of that claim was a statutory prerequisite to the initiation of a lawsuit in Arizona against a state agency such as the Arizona Board of Regents.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.376" offset="701143">That claim was denied by Arizona and Mr. Rutledge's federal court lawsuit followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.762" offset="726743">One of his claims in the federal suit was that Mr. Kush and others had conspired to intimidate witnesses in violation of 14 U.S.C. Section 1985(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="163.689" offset="782436">The district court dismissed the entire lawsuit as to all defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.843" offset="803021">On appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, as pertinent here, the Court of Appeals determined that Mr. Rutledge had stated a claim under the first clause of 1985(2) and specifically held that there was no requirement for invidiously discriminatory class-based animus in such an action.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.875" offset="895181">This holding of the Ninth Circuit aligned it with the Third Circuit and the District of Columbia Circuit, which previously had ruled the same way.</text>

            <text syncTime="201.481" offset="933528">Mr. Gallagher, I would like to get a time sequence straight if I could.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.266" offset="948679">This action alleged intimidation of witnesses in the federal court system?</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael L. Gallagher</label>
            <text syncTime="213.039" offset="979817">Justice Rehnquist, this complaint in this lawsuit alleges that from the time Mr. Rutledge filed his claim against the Arizona State University Board of Regents, which was prior to the initiation of any suit, and continuing the conspiracy supposedly went on.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.750" offset="1050661">Initially, there was no claim pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.785" offset="1062782">As it turned out, Mr. Rutledge filed his case in federal court and shortly thereafter filed virtually the same case in state court, presumably to protect his one-year statute of limitations under 1983.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="253.030" offset="1139791">Well then, the only case in which there could have been witnesses would I'm sure be the state court case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael L. Gallagher</label>
            <text syncTime="258.568" offset="1161943">My understanding of what the Ninth Circuit found in that regard, Justice Rehnquist, was that the language in the complaint, the continuing language, if you would, if you will, suggested that there was intimidation of witnesses going on after the federal court case had been filed.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="281.183" stopTime="286.503">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="281.183" offset="1252431">Well, but there are no witnesses in a case until the case has been tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.635" offset="1266224">There may be potential witnesses.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael L. Gallagher</label>
            <text syncTime="286.503" offset="1273643">Well, that raises the next question, Justice Rehnquist, as to how broad 1985(1) as to what is a pending action.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.943" offset="1311468">There have been discussions as to what "attending court" means in that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.763" offset="1338740">But the Ninth Circuit said, while it was a close question, it did state a claim and that it should be remanded, and specifically suggested that the district court ask Mr. Rutledge to file an amended complaint setting forth in specificity the specific acts he claimed gave rise to his cause of action.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="324.093" stopTime="327.462">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="324.093" offset="1424003">Have there been any proceedings on remand in the district court?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_l_gallagher" startTime="327.462" stopTime="486.199">
            <label>Mr. Michael L. Gallagher</label>
            <text syncTime="327.462" offset="1437483">There have not been, Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.764" offset="1446678">As I was pointing out, the circuits have split on the question of a requirement for invidiously discriminatory class-based animus in a 1985, Section 2, clause 1 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.125" offset="1512193">Generally speaking, 1985(2) deals with conspiracies which interfere with the judicial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.397" offset="1549287">The language consists of two clauses separated by a semicolon.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.051" offset="1575827">The first clause prohibits conspiracies to deter by force, intimidation or threat parties or witnesses in the federal court processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.157" offset="1612294">The language which follows the semicolon, the second clause, prohibits conspiracies to impede, hinder, obstruct or defeat due course of justice in any state or territory with the intent to deny any citizen equal protection of the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.702" offset="1674465">It is the Petitioners' position that a cause of action under either clause of 1985(2) requires a finding of invidiously discriminatory class-based animus.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.426" offset="1725352">There seems to be no question today but that that is a co-requirement under second clause or state action lawsuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.616" offset="1766103">That seems to be the teaching of Griffin versus Breckenridge, 1971, and all five circuits who have directly dealt with the question of 1985 have not had any problem realizing that second clause lawsuits have to be based on invidiously discriminatory class-based animus because of the equal protection language.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.314" offset="1856905">The diversity of opinion and the problem arises because the first clause simply does not have equal protection language.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.587" offset="1890028">We believe that the analysis of this Court in Griffin versus Breckenridge applies with equal vigor to the case at bar and that there should be a finding that invidiously discriminatory class-based animus is a requirement under either clause of 1985(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="457.799" offset="1958887">In Griffin this Court did not engage in a hypertechnical dissection of the syntax of the language, but instead took a look at the legislative history in depth, with an eye towards the realities of what was going on in this country in 1871 when the 42nd Congress enacted the Ku Klux Klan Act, which of course is the original Act on which both 1985(3) and 1985(2) are based.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="486.199" offset="2072467">Mr. Gallagher, why do you think the Congress in 1871 did not include the equal protection language in the first clause?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_l_gallagher" startTime="494.055" stopTime="582.113">
            <label>Mr. Michael L. Gallagher</label>
            <text syncTime="494.055" offset="2103919">I think, Your Honor, that they were not thinking about federal courts as much as they were thinking about state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.446" offset="2149476">And there were not as many federal courts then.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.564" offset="2161910">The limitation on jurisdiction of federal courts was much less.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.266" offset="2172673">I do not think they needed it for a constitutional nexus because under Article I, Section 8 or elsewhere, obviously, there is no problem there.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.122" offset="2212170">It is very difficult, Justice O'Connor, to discern what that Congress had in mind 100 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.811" offset="2246861">There is a little something in the legislative history for everyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.513" offset="2257727">And as this Court expressed in Navatny, construction, statutory construction in these Civil War, post-Civil War era Reconstruction statutes have given lots of difficulty to statutory construction problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.059" offset="2331915">There was already a criminal statute in place, Justice O'Connor, and it had been in place for 40 some odd years at the time, governing people that would attempt to impede witnesses in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.270" offset="2396699">I don't know why the language was not specifically included here.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.174" offset="2428359">I believe it was included and sprinkled throughout the Act because of the problems Congress had--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="582.113" stopTime="588.117">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="582.113" offset="2456154">Well, to assure constitutionality in its application to the states, right?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_l_gallagher" startTime="588.117" stopTime="896.767">
            <label>Mr. Michael L. Gallagher</label>
            <text syncTime="588.117" offset="2480082">--I would agree with that, yes, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.050" offset="2483843">And it wasn't... there was no constitutional problem with this particular law.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.218" offset="2500562">As this Court recognized in Griffin, 1985(2) was initially a criminal statute, but the broad sweep of the language caused the amendatory process to go into gear and ultimately the civil remedies provided by 1985(3) were added to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.917" offset="2591363">As you said in Griffin versus Breckenridge, and it's equally applicable here, the overwhelming concern as expressed by the heated lengthy debates at the time was with the animus or the intent required.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.011" offset="2647683">That's where all the discussion centered.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.664" offset="2666283">I might point out that you also said in Griffin versus Breckenridge that that was the type of case, involving three Mississippi blacks that had had their constitutional rights impaired because they'd apparently been associated with somebody someone thought was a civil rights worker, was the type of case that went to the core of what 1985 had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.530" offset="2761786">This case sub judice is a far cry from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.565" offset="2777878">The country faced a number of problems in 1871... political, economic, social.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.920" offset="2811314">It was not the intent of the 42nd Congress to solve every ill of the times by enacting the Ku Klux Klan Act back then.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.526" offset="2849767">Their overwhelming concern was with the attempted disenfranchisement of the newly freed slaves.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.215" offset="2880487">They were particularly concerned with the dangers presented by the hooded conspirators grouping together to deprive these newest citizens of their federal constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.523" offset="2929701">There is no suggestion anywhere in the legislative history that the federal courts were somehow pulled out and examined to see if added protection was needed for the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.866" offset="2987066">It seems reasonable that what happened in connection with the federal courts is that Congress intended to provide them protection from the civil upheaval being caused by the Ku Klux Klan activities of the time, and there simply was no independent consideration given.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.042" offset="3047775">It is abundantly clear that the problem Congress was responding to was racially and otherwise motivated by Ku Klux Klan activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.684" offset="3094377">In view of the fact that there were already ample criminal statutes on hand, they were not attempting... and such statutes, of course, have never been construed by this Court to create private causes of action, and the 42nd Congress was not attempting to do that with 1985(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="757.943" offset="3159474">They were concerned with interference in the federal process, and for that matter the state process.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.930" offset="3179327">But it was only interference, we respectfully submit, which was grounded on invidiously discriminatory class-based animus.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.334" offset="3209003">Extending the coverage of 1985(2) past the point ever intended by the Congress that enacted it will in truth and in fact, we submit, not do one thing to advance the cause of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.165" offset="3280265">There are today sufficient criminal statutes on the books to act as a chilling effect or a deterring effect to people who would interfere with the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.686" offset="3318403">Furthermore, the underlying activity, the force, the coercion, the threats, are ordinarily going to be able to be compensated for under state tort action.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.328" offset="3372947">Lastly, in any event the Respondent here is not a proper party to maintain this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.100" offset="3408056">This statute, unlike 1985(3), does not talk in terms of indirect suffering.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.956" offset="3443478">It talks about direct action.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.658" offset="3454240">Admittedly, the only court that we were able to discern which has ever addressed this proposition is a district court in Maryland in 1978, but the holding was clear and the holding was sound, and that was that a party does not have a cause of action for interference with his witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.488" offset="3529577">One further indicia of this is the fact that 1985(2), first clause, provides a cause of action for after the fact retaliation or retribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.713" offset="3578479">It provides a cause of action for a juror or a witness who has already testified or already rendered his verdict and is later harassed, intimidated or threatened.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.152" offset="3620274">That would indicate that someone with standing such as Respondent here, a party, who is not himself intimidated, would have no complaint after the verdict had been entered or after a witness had already testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.994" offset="3679625">And because of the narrow issue, as we see it, presented to the Court, I would like to reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="1362.186" offset="5576428">He was taking on a hero, an idol of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.221" offset="5592519">And it got so serious that the Plaintiff's life was threatened, his family's life was threatened, his attorney's life was threatened.</text>

            <text syncTime="1386.683" offset="5674335">And if the state court of appeals reverses and sends the case back for a new trial, then obviously at that point the Plaintiff-Respondent would have the choice of determining whether he wants the case retried on the merits in the federal court or the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.048" offset="5759807">Now, Kevin Rutledge in his amended complaint alleged that the Defendants have conspired to prevent by intimidation and threat various material witnesses from freely, fully and truthfully testifying as to matters raised in the within complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.544" offset="5849878">42 U.S. Code Section 1985(2), the first portion, gives the injured party a damage action against those who have conspired to deter by force, intimidation or threat any party or witness from testifying in any matter pending in any federal court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1574.272" offset="6424781">The significant fact in this case is that the first portion of Section 1985(2) prohibits conduct which forms the basis for the claim which is a serious interference with the judicial process itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.887" offset="6519239">So that the question really is whether Congress gave the federal courts the jurisdiction to hear private damage actions without regard to class-based discriminatory animus where the action is based on interference with the judicial processes of the federal courts themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.317" offset="6612967">We suggest that Congress clearly did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.955" offset="6631461">First, the language of the statute supports this interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.893" offset="6663226">Second, legislative history supports this interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.880" offset="6687154">Third, common sense and logic compels this interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.618" offset="6714113">There is also no question that Congress had the power to so legislate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.855" offset="6739086">Now, a close reading of Section 1985 shows that it had basically four parts or four prohibited acts in the first portion of the statute prior to the semicolon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.541" offset="6849845">In the first instance, they prohibited the threatening of parties or witnesses who were about to testify in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.765" offset="6906687">The second item was a prohibition against doing injury to a party or witness who had already testified in a federal court.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert Ong Hing</label>
            <text syncTime="1722.884" offset="7019223">I do not believe so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.772" offset="7038763">But in this case, under this statute the Congress made it a private right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.426" offset="7065407">In other words, the argument that this was already covered by the criminal statutes does not mean that it cannot also be covered by a civil statute giving the injured party a damage claim, and that is precisely what is done in Section 1985(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.554" offset="7141894">The third item which the first part of Section 1985(2) prohibits is that you cannot attempt to influence the verdict of a juror or influence a juror.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.849" offset="7211066">And the fourth item is that you cannot injure a juror after he has assented to a verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.205" offset="7240428">So the first part of Section 1985(2) covers all of those four items, the first two having to do with witnesses either before or after testifying and the second two having to do with jurors either before or after participating in a verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.868" offset="7323079">And then after the semicolon, the two items which are prohibited involve obstructing justice with intent to deny any citizen equal protection of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.448" offset="7405417">But it says</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.148" offset="7412209">"obstructing justice in any state or territory. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.519" offset="7429763">"So as soon as you get past the semicolon Congress is talking about actions in a state or territory, not in the federal court, as it was prior to the semicolon. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.945" offset="7491412">Then the second item which is covered after the semicolon is action to injure a person who is attempting to enforce his right to equal protection, and that also presumably would be in a state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.525" offset="7573750">So I think clearly Congress delineated what the limits were or what the conditions were with respect to the restricted or the proscribed acts before the semicolon and after the semicolon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.819" offset="7650968">There is absolutely no equal protection language before the semicolon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.258" offset="7680643">Each one of the proscribed acts relates to protection of the integrity of the judicial process itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.364" offset="7721081">And after the semicolon they don't talk about federal courts; they now talk about acts in the state, and you have broad, sweeping language with equal protection requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.410" offset="7789313">So the statutory language itself is quite clear, even without regard to exploring the legislative intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.419" offset="7845319">Now, legislative intent in many instances, or rather in most instances, is rather difficult to determine, but I think that there is no ambiguity with respect to legislative intent in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.214" offset="7924523">Congress was concerned about restoration of federal courts after the Civil War.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.737" offset="7962557">They wanted to protect the functioning of the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.140" offset="7980216">There was serious question as to whether state courts were either willing or able to protect the rights of all citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.948" offset="8023474">And the debates on the legislation show very clearly that where Congress was legislating with respect to any matter which affected an officer or agency of the Federal Government they saw no necessity to insert equal protection language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.730" offset="8126606">However, in other areas involving conspiracies having no direct impact on either a federal officer or a federal agency, Congress did insert equal protection language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.739" offset="8186583">I think that it certainly is not a great extension of jurisdiction to the federal court to give the federal court jurisdiction to entertain a private damage action under the present circumstances, because each one of those four items which occurs in Section 1985, subsection (2), first phrase or first clause, involves matters which are within the contempt power of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.150" offset="8348229">And apparently Congress felt that it would assist the court in protecting the integrity of its own processes by giving private actions to all parties who might be damaged by such interference with the judicial processes of the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.199" offset="8440493">Finally, I think that clearly we do not require any Fourteenth Amendment mandate or sanction in order to have Congress legislate with respect to the four items occurring in the first part of that subsection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.183" offset="8552402">The power to regulate federal courts and to give federal courts whatever powers are necessary to regulate its own functioning is found in Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.795" offset="8614782">With respect to the so-called split of districts, or rather Court of Appeals, on this issue, I think that a close reading of the two cases, one in the Fifth Circuit, which is the Kimble case, and the Jones case which was in the Eighth Circuit, would show that actually none of those cases involved a claim which fell within the first portion of Section 1985, subsection (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.336" offset="8776950">In Kimble, the Plaintiff sued employers for denying him employment because of his prior history of filing lawsuits under workman's compensation claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.881" offset="8843197">Well, certainly that doesn't fall under any of the four items of the first clause of Section 1985(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.987" offset="8883634">So I think the court correctly ruled that he didn't have a claim under the first portion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.645" offset="8926266">With respect to the Jones case, that involved a case where a mistrial was declared because the U.S. Attorney had used electronic surveillance equipment to monitor a juror to determine whether the juror was going to be contacted by a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.112" offset="9028144">Now, that particular claim I don't think falls under any of the first four items of 1985(2) either.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.718" offset="9066492">So a close study of those two cases would indicate that there is nothing inconsistent in the opinions of the Fifth Circuit and Eighth Circuit which is contrary to the position of the Respondent here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2298.493" offset="9321656">But I certainly did not see a claim under the first portion of Section 1985(2) in the Fifth Circuit and Eighth Circuit cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.968" offset="9375572">With respect to the authority of Griffin v. Breckenridge, I don't think that that of course involves or really is relevant to this case at all, because Griffin v. Breckenridge was based on a 1985 subsection (3) claim, which very clearly contains equal protection language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.237" offset="9496572">Furthermore, the Court in Griffin v. Breckenridge based its decision not on the Fourteenth Amendment but on the Thirteenth Amendment and on the right to interstate travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.961" offset="9547458">So I don't think that case is on point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.199" offset="9568461">We certainly don't think that there's any danger here of creating a federal tort law, because under the circumstances of the case a party would already have to be in the federal court on another matter in order for him to allege that his witnesses were being intimidated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.116" offset="9684131">So really, Plaintiff Kevin Rutledge would have to have another claim under federal jurisdiction in order to have a 1985 subsection (2) claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="2787.339" offset="11276973">In other words, once you give a player a scholarship and say come to school, he in effect has a scholarship for four years even though he turns out to be a miserable football player, as long as he comes to practice and makes himself available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.451" offset="11345414">Well, the Defendant Kush had an effective means of getting rid of those people in that category, and the Plaintiff Kush was in that group of people, the group that were offered scholarships that did not meet his playing specifications or expectations and players that he wanted to get rid of in order to make scholarships available so that he could continue to give out 30 scholarships every year to incoming players.</text>

            <text syncTime="2884.117" offset="11664108">Those are the same allegations that resulted in a defense verdict for Mr. Kush of any wrongdoing, and I think the Court needs to know that having heard all of the allegations.</text>
