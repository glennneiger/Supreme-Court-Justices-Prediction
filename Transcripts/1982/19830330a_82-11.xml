            <text syncTime="64.037" offset="402417">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.222" offset="419136">This is an appeal from the Indiana Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.221" offset="435123">This case presents the question of whether the Indiana tax sale statutes which were in effect at the time this case arose violate due process in equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.044" offset="478486">It is the position of the Mennonite Board of Missions that the Indiana tax sale statutes violate due process because they only provide for constructive notice to a mortgagee of record.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.633" offset="532821">The statutes only provided for notice by posting at the courthouse and publication in a newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.082" offset="566571">This case arose as a quiet title action filed by the Appellee, Richard C. Adams.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.486" offset="596246">Mr. Adams had purchased the property at 1829 Stevens Avenue in Elkhart at a tax sale on August 8, 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.184" offset="642953">Prior to the tax sale, Jean Moore owned the property in fee simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.432" offset="668031">The Mennonite Board of Missions had a mortgage on that property.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.930" offset="686003">The most significant fact in this case is that the Mennonite Board of Missions mortgage was recorded.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.740" offset="717245">It was a matter of public record.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.378" offset="727799">It was found in the Elkhart County recorder's office in Volume 388, page 693 of the Elkhart County records.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.952" offset="774088">The name and address of the Mennonite Board of Missions was thus a matter of public record.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.636" offset="808778">Under the terms of that mortgage Moore was required to pay the property taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.165" offset="834901">She failed to pay those taxes.</text>

            <text syncTime="175.570" offset="848589">No, it does not, Justice Blackmun, as to why she did not pay the taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.412" offset="871890">But she was, despite not paying the taxes, she was paying that mortgage each month to the Mennonite Board of Missions, which I think is also a very significant point.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.641" offset="916821">Under Indiana law if the taxes aren't paid on property for more than 15 months, the county auditor will compile a list of delinquent property tax... properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.713" offset="981082">And, in this case, they would then send notice under Indiana law to the legal title owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.069" offset="1014519">Indiana law does not provide any mailed notice to an owner of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.752" offset="1049314">It is the position of the Mennonite Board of Missions that due process requires, at a minimum, mailed notice to a mortgagee of record.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.295" offset="1099469">Had there been notice mailed to the Mennonite Board of Missions, in this case, I submit to this Court that the Mennonite Board of Missions would have paid the taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.555" offset="1152445">That's demonstrated by the fact that soon after they learned that the property had actually been sold for delinquent taxes, they immediately tendered to the trial court the statutory amount due to redeem their property.</text>

            <text syncTime="1494.413" offset="6123965">That is, there was not adequate notice given where the name and address is known, that due process requires at a minimum notice by mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.611" offset="6176733">This Court recently, just last term, in Green v. Lindsey reaffirmed those well-entrenched principles established in Mullane.</text>

            <text syncTime="1526.087" offset="6250607">In that case the procedure utilized by Kentucky is more likely intended to reach a tenant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.834" offset="6293552">The case involved an eviction of a tenant and in the Kentucky statutes it first provided for personal service by the sheriff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.345" offset="6335662">There was absolutely no requirement of personal service in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.952" offset="6354052">If the tenant was not home that case provided for posting on the door of the tenant's apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.401" offset="6387906">I submit to this Court that posting on the property or an intrusion on the property by the state is far more likely or reasonably calculated to inform a person of an eviction action than is the form of notice chosen by Indiana in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.692" offset="6465020">There have been other states that have considered virtually the same question as raised in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1686.586" offset="6892592">But I think the first place to begin is that the Court should understand and determine under Indiana law that a mortgagee is not an owner of any property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.254" offset="6931253">The Furnish case which is a case in Indiana where the supreme court reiterated the decision that it made in Mennonite Board versus Adams, I quote,</text>

            <text syncTime="3332.333" offset="13475554">I've never had the opportunity to use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.597" offset="13480674">That statute is used in my research in some of the... some of the other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.063" offset="13510558">The Appellant in this case has indicated in his brief and, again in that same footnote, that the law of the State of Indiana is that a deed and mortgage is taken to the auditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.573" offset="13560504">The law in the State in Indiana is, is that a deed, before it be recorded, is taken to the auditor and placed on there are the words to be entered for taxation, or words to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.004" offset="13622257">The auditor writes down who owns the property and their address and... so that the county knows, that are going to be taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.704" offset="13657053">As to mortgages, the statute says and only says, that before the auditor makes that endorsement on the deed, he may require a tax identification number, and I emphasize may, on other instruments including mortgages that divest a person of a mortgage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.553" offset="13756422">That sounds a little complicated, but Indiana has a law that if you have a mortgage on a piece of property, you pay less property taxes because you have that mortgage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.082" offset="13790591">There is no requirement to take the mortgage to the auditor's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.110" offset="13810653">In other words, there's no way for an auditor under the Indiana scheme of things to have a name and post office address.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.093" offset="13834685">But in this case there was no post office address.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.420" offset="13847955">There was notice that was reasonably calculated in the general scheme of things and I reasonably submit under Mullane, even if the Court felt that all these mortgage holders should get notice that Mullane and all of the cases afterwards... in the case of Laz versus Arizona, they made a point that Laz versus Arizona requires a letter to a mortgage holder that the taxes, or the property's going to be sold, or it's going to be deeded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.202" offset="13979090">But even in Laz, it says that's only to the mortgage or the lien holders whose names and post office addresses are in the public record without inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.713" offset="14029141">They're open and available, as was said in Mullane.</text>

            <text syncTime="3577.826" offset="14457549">She was asked to leave the property and she went to the Mennonite Board of Missions and informed them that she was in trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.699" offset="14485030">The first time that they learned there was problem was from her at that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="3598.928" offset="14541977">In this case, the only interest of the state is for the collection and payment of taxes and that if mailed notice was sent to mortgagees that would actually further the states interest of collecting taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.218" offset="14603103">In the brief, I cite an Indiana case where the mortgagor and there were... the mortgagor and the mortgagee, one or the other... their property was listed for sale for delinquent taxes and the county auditor mailed notice to... after the tax sale, mailed notice to the mortgagee, informed them that the property had been sold for delinquent taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.113" offset="14718669">The mortgagee promptly paid the tax and, in investigating what happened as far as why the taxes hadn't been paid, learned that the property taxes... the payment had not gone onto a computer list and had it gone onto the computer list, it would have never made the tax sales in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.605" offset="14796723">So the mailing of notice would actually assist the state in notifying mortgagees who are likely to pay the taxes and in all likelihood would pay the taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3673.257" offset="14839250">And it would further the state's interest of collecting the taxes as soon as possible and in a fast and expeditious manner.</text>
