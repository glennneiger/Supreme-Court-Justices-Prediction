            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="145516">We will hear arguments next in City of Los Angeles against Lyons.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.951" offset="173310">Mr. Merkin, I think you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="frederick_n_merkin" startTime="80.296" stopTime="307.781">
            <label>Mr. Frederick N. Merkin</label>
            <text syncTime="80.296" offset="466613">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="84.217" offset="482287">This case concerns the important constitutional questions of: Under what circumstances may an individual seek protection from the federal district court against local law enforcement agencies relative to the force techniques that the officers of those agencies may in the future apply against such individual?</text>
            <text syncTime="107.097" offset="573820">The case also concerns the circumstances where, if the court is going to entertain such a plea, the federal judiciary may assume control over the force techniques utilized by local law enforcement agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.185" offset="630244">I think at the outset it's important to acknowledge what is almost obvious, namely that the situations faced by police officers on the streets are often difficult ones, and sometimes situations that most of us are unable easily to relate to.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.383" offset="690953">Secondly, from the governmental standpoint the issues are also quite complex and difficult and often deal, when you're speaking of use of force, with the kinds of questions that are often faced, for example, in deciding upon military tactics.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.501" offset="751452">These are very difficult of resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.015" offset="765558">Now, there are really two decisions from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that are at issue here, and the city of course submits that they were erroneously reasoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.417" offset="807145">But before going to the defects, the most important and significant defects in the reasoning of those two opinions, it may be helpful to have some background in this matter, in particular with reference to recent developments which may or may not affect the justiciability of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.318" offset="874750">As you probably know, the city believes that the case is not moot and needs to be resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.986" offset="901395">But, beginning with the beginning, about five and a half years ago the Respondent Mr. Lyons filed an action in federal district court seeking both a declaration and an injunction against the Los Angeles police department to limit the use of the unconscious-rendering control holds to situations where an officer is faced with deadly force.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.384" offset="991047">We submit that that's the effective prohibition of such holds.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.163" offset="1010065">And his primary theory and the theory that developed was that the control holds shock the conscience.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.848" offset="1036814">And the Respondent's position is that the control holds shock the conscience intrinsically, having little to do, if anything, with the training of the officers, but they're intrinsically of the kind that shock the conscience.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.169" offset="1094179">Now, the control holds of which we speak are neck restraints that are really of two different fundamental varieties.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.463" offset="1127302">The first are techniques that officers apply with their arm on both sides of the neck, to put pressure on the carotid arteries which transmit oxygenated blood to the brain.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.365" offset="1178920">The second family are techniques known as arm restraints, which rely pressure of the forearm against the front of the neck and the tracheal tube.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.548" offset="1215700">The purpose of both of those techniques is to assume control of the individual, and in the vast majority... and the record demonstrates this... people submit.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.044" offset="1257601">They do have the potential, as the record reflects and the district court found, of rendering people unconscious if necessary, whereupon they can be turned onto their belly, which is the typical approach, and handcuffed such that that person is now in control.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.961" offset="1313294">Now, these are techniques that officers are trained in, but they're relatively infrequently applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.865" offset="1336909">We're speaking of thousands upon thousands of encounters between police officers and citizens, and in a large city such as Los Angeles we're speaking of a tremendous number of arrests.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="307.781" stopTime="312.061">
            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="307.781" offset="1376615">You speak of training.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.281" offset="1382571">Isn't training an issue in the case?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="frederick_n_merkin" startTime="312.061" stopTime="382.284">
            <label>Mr. Frederick N. Merkin</label>
            <text syncTime="312.061" offset="1393751">The case need not be decided on training, this case need not.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.248" offset="1406499">The district court certainly had that issue before it, but the fundamental error here is legal.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.776" offset="1432517">More specifically, Mr. Justice Blackmun, it has to do with the legal standards that were demanded of the district court upon review in the Lyons II decision, as we call it, the review of the preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.864" offset="1488941">We submit that the Court of Appeals failed to look for the application of the appropriate legal standards, and those legal standards of which I speak and they are really quite related.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.720" offset="1536380">One is the standard that derives from principles of federalism and equity, which says that the federal courts should only assume control over the activities, let's say, of a police department in the most extraordinary circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.575" offset="1595730">Secondly, to have a constitutional violation here the court had to find that the tactic shocked the conscience.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.540" offset="1623629">That too requires in effect the most extraordinary type of conducts.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.490" offset="1643377">Indeed, I believe in a concurring opinion you wrote, Mr. Justice Blackmun, outrageous conduct is what triggers the constitutional violation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1915.030" offset="7805558">Now, I submit to you that that, plus the fact that they are quite obviously having a disparate impact on the black male population of Los Angeles... you are 12 times more likely to be strangled if you are black, to die of strangulation, if you are a black male than if you are white.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.927" offset="7893121">And 12 of the 16 deaths have been black males.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.925" offset="7913183">There are 200,000, approximately 200,000, black males in the city, and they're killing approximately 2 per year with strangle holds.</text>

            <text syncTime="2139.751" offset="8704484">Your Honor, the record shows that apparently several of them were under the influence of various drugs, and that may have well contributed to their deaths, because when you're under the influence of narcotic-type drugs, including alcohol, you're insensitive to paint and so when a police officer puts a choke hold on you and seeks to obtain your compliance by causing you paint like that bar arm control, you don't feel it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.336" offset="8802809">And if you don't feel it, he can continue to give pressure before you stop, and you die by virtue of that insensitivity to pain.</text>

            <text syncTime="2176.627" offset="8852024">The district court made that finding, in fact, that those people are ones who are very, very delicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.157" offset="8874071">Now, the cases that the Court seems to rely on in terms of judging whether Mr. Lyons has standing do not involve the threat of death, and that's what distinguishes them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.977" offset="8945333">A threat, an immediate threat, is comprised of at least four elements: First of all, you've got to know you're threatened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.648" offset="8968007">There's got to be some real probability that you're going to be subject to... the threat's going to be carried out.</text>

            <text syncTime="2219.517" offset="9023492">Now, the consequence is what in many cases, it seems to met is implicitly assumed but never expressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.778" offset="9060585">The threat of death as a consequence is much different than the threat that bail will be too high, as in O'Shea, or that you'll be treated discriminatorily by a judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.928" offset="9113144">The fact that the Philadelphia police department doesn't have a disciplinary process that adequately disciplines police officers, as in Rizzo, doesn't involve a threat of death, a direct threat that we can calculate, as we can in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.421" offset="9183152">I don't think anyone in this room would like to trade places with Adolph Lyons and have that chance that they're going to die.</text>
