            <text syncTime="11.251" offset="137220">This case raises the question whether a person who has been convicted of a crime in a state court may recover damages under the Federal Civil Rights Acts from a police officer who is alleged to have given false testimony at the criminal trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.860" offset="199705">The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit concluded that a police officer was entitled to the same immunity from liability as a lay witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.924" offset="235962">And that such a damage action against an officer may not be maintained.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.064" offset="256442">Although this conclusion is consistent with the decisions in most courts that have addressed the issue, a contrary opinion has also been expressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.812" offset="291447">In view of the importance of the question, we granted certiorari to decide it.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.274" offset="309314">As we explain in an opinion filed with the clerk today, we agree with the majority view and therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.108" offset="348707">Justice Brennan, Justice Marshall, and Justice Blackmun have filed dissenting opinions.</text>
