            <text syncTime="7.342" offset="121651">In this case, the respondent, Royer, was stopped by police officers as he was about to board a plane, the Florida airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.986" offset="168149">The officers told him he was suspected of carrying drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.591" offset="182568">He accompanied them to a room off the concourse and there he consented to the search of his luggage, which the officers had retrieved from the airline.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.643" offset="226767">Drugs were found in each of two suitcases.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.413" offset="241918">The trial judge denied Royer's motion to suppress the evidence, but -- and he was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.079" offset="276505">The Florida Court of Appeals set aside the conviction holding that when Royer gave his consent, he was being illegally detained and hence, his consent was tainted and the evidence was inadmissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.661" offset="334914">We granted certiorari and we affirm that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.760" offset="355290">However, there is not an opinion for the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.900" offset="367829">I have filed an opinion stating why Justice Marshall, Justice Powell and Justice Stevens and myself would affirm the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.761" offset="407326">Justice Brennan would also affirm and has filed an opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.553" offset="418402">Justice Powell has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.457" offset="430105">Justice -- Justice Blackmun and Justice Rehnquist have each filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.731" offset="451211">The Chief Justice and Justice O'Connor joined Justice Rehnquist.</text>
