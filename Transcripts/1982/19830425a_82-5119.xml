            <text syncTime="113.311" offset="597527">Basically, he got the bank involved through the bank's mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.651" offset="614873">It is my position in reading the statute and it has created an ambiguity.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.883" offset="647787">It has got the Courts of Appeal... I think it is five to four now... construing this statute both narrowly and broadly.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.741" offset="679238">The bank robbery statute which in 1934 was specifically limited to bank robbery amended in 1937 to include the terms 1937 interpreted and argued by the government that, in fact, this covered only common law larceny.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.418" offset="765965">So the position now... The former Fifth Circuit now the Eleventh first went along with my arguments in my brief then en banc reversed itself and took the broad position that 2113(b) covered the crime of false pretense.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.393" offset="841824">The reason all this has come about is the way this Congress drew the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.767" offset="863349">The statute was drawn as follows: It indicated that you take and carry away, steal, or purloin, words that are not necessarily defined specifically at common law but are in fact defined now generically.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.555" offset="946523">But in 1934, 1937 were contemplated in the common law sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.274" offset="965436">What has happened is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.255" offset="973273">In 1934 a broad bank robbery statute in dual form was submitted to the House Judiciary Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.177" offset="1009008">The Committee considered this bill and specifically, specifically rejected the aspects of the bill that covered crimes of false pretense, embezzlement and other crimes by trick or consensual takings and restricted it to the forceful robbery concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.167" offset="1084972">Thus, the title of the Act, the text of the bill and the thrust of the situation in 1934 with the gangster-style bank robberies going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.099" offset="1124678">Subsequently, apparently in briefly reading the Act the prosecutors have brought prosecutions of people who take money from banks in various types of ways, false checks, forgeries, false pretenses, trick, deceipt, fraud, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.859" offset="1199702">Four districts have gone along with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.357" offset="1213704">Four districts have not.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.857" offset="1223735">However, the Supreme Court itself in Jerome in 1943 took the position and the government took the position that the Bank Robbery Act, 2213(b) was a common law situation defining the crimes it intended to proscribe as robbery, burglary, and larceny even though the Act eventually uses the terms</text>
            <text syncTime="297.891" offset="1335852">"steal, purloin, take and carry away. "</text>
            <text syncTime="301.015" offset="1348391">which are not specific to those crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.967" offset="1364169">In Turley, the Supreme Court gave us some indications how we should interpret these nonspecific common law terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.963" offset="1412130">What they have said is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.133" offset="1424877">You look to the legislative history of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.571" offset="1434595">In this case specifically in Le Master the Ninth Circuit looked at the legislative history in great detail and quoted directly from it saying they could not do better than the analysis which they put forth of the legislative history which showed specifically the Act was originally intended to be broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.185" offset="1513067">It was tightened and limited to robbery in 1934 and then extended to burglary and common law larceny only in 1937.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.321" offset="1549638">For this reason the factual situation that Mr. Bell put himself in unwittingly exempted him from prosecution under 2113(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="362.490" offset="1594255">In the dissent in the Eleventh Circuit the judge said it is not a question that Mr. Bell has committed some kind of a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.519" offset="1626334">However, the crime he committed is not contemplated in 2113(b) because the legislative history combined with the title to the Act combined with the fact that the Act contemplated a, shall we say, active or violent taking away from, robbery, burglary, some kind of active, moving type of crime as opposed to the act of crime of false pretenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.522" offset="1746393">That is something stealthily done.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.896" offset="1755901">It is our position if you follow Turley and the appellate courts that look at Turley carefully and analyze the guidelines in Turley and apply them to the act in this case including the context of the Act, that is robbery, violent acts, taking away, carrying away, that type of thing with the fact that they were specifically in the bill in the House investigation of what they should do about the robbery situations occurring in the '30s took and eliminated the crime of false pretenses from the purview of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.676" offset="1922980">It is my conclusion and I think the only conclusion that is reasonable if you take the Act and interpret the ambiguities in it in accordance with what has happened, legislative--</text>

            <text syncTime="516.333" offset="2209596">That is correct, and that creates the ambiguity in this sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.987" offset="2224224">If you look at the history of the law, if they intended to cover that type of crime they would not have eliminated specifically the crime of false pretenses as they did in the legislative debates that created the robbery statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.482" offset="2282216">They wanted to leave the states with that type of crime specifically focusing the federal law on the crime involving robbery, active carrying away, the violent gangster-type crime that initiated this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.492" offset="2346268">That is my analysis of that ambiguity situation, Judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.523" offset="2358389">In Turley where they were interpreting the dire act of the interstate transportation of stolen motor vehicles that type of thing, stolen was construed consistently with the legislative history to be a broad thing where the federal government had an interest in controlling interstate transportation of stolen vehicles.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.670" offset="2443026">In this case it is the exact opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.841" offset="2455669">The Congress specifically eliminated the crime of false pretenses in its debate before creating the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.072" offset="2488584">That is analyzed very well, I think, in Le Master, the Ninth Circuit decision which is inconsistent with the other four decisions in applying Turley to the word "stolen" in the context of the statute along with the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.298" offset="2553472">The only conclusion I think you can come to reasonably if you look at Le Master and go along with Turley is that 2113(b) was a restrictive statute and the government used to argue in 1937 that in fact it was a restrictive statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2191.522" offset="8910422">To assume that Congress in 1937 had reintroduced these distinctions would mean that it would be a violation of this statute if someone mistakenly received $1,000 as I said before and decided to keep it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2236.346" offset="9089726">Petitioner and the few Circuits supporting his view in our view confused the purpose of the 1934 Congress with the purpose of the 1937 Congress and interpret those purposes as being exactly the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.777" offset="9151375">The 1934 bill as presented by the Attorney General and passed by the Senate would originally have prohibited robbery, burglary, and larceny defined actually as both taking by false pretenses and larceny at common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.428" offset="9218040">The House Judiciary Committee struck the burglary and the larceny provision not as Petitioner would have it because of some concern over the reach of common law larceny.</text>

            <text syncTime="2287.344" offset="9293691">That Congress, the 1934 Congress was concerned with limiting the crime to reach the situation of interstate gangster bank robbers and wanted to limit the crime just to robbery and not to embrace burglary or any form of larceny.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.601" offset="9350742">The 1937 Congress when it took up this subject again clearly had a different purpose than the 1934 Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.882" offset="9387836">The 1937 bill was intended to broaden coverage beyond robbery, beyond just merely taking by force and violence to cover burglary and larceny.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.516" offset="9430363">Concededly under everyone's interpretation of this statute, it would cover crimes such as taking money mistakenly given by the bank or larceny by trick, scarcely crimes that are committed by the Bonnie and Clyde interstate bank robbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.119" offset="9496819">Once Congress removed the force and violence limitation and expanded the statute to reach nonviolent theft as well as fraudulent theft, it cannot be logical to ascribe to the 1937 Congress the same intent as the 1934 Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.704" offset="9563170">Rather the more logical and sensible conclusion is that in expanding the statute the intent of the 1937 Congress was to give broad protection to banks whose assets were insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.059" offset="9628580">Now the choice of words that Congress used, I believe, is very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.290" offset="9653449">The Petitioner relies very heavily on the fact that Congress selected the words "take and carry away" and the title larceny as if those two formulations are code words for all of the ancient distinctions of common law larceny.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.442" offset="9710082">By 1937, however, the words "take and carry away" as well as the term "larceny" no longer were limited solely to describing common law larceny.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.734" offset="9755222">In fact, in the 1934 bill which passed the Senate it used the words "take and carry away" to go on and define takings without consent which would have been common law larceny and then taking and carrying away with consent which at ancient common law would have been a false pretenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.086" offset="9836619">As this Court has noted in the Turley decision, by 1919 the law of many states had developed to include not only common law larceny but larceny by trick and false pretenses in their prohibition of generic larceny and theft offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.860" offset="9899731">This Court, in fact, in the Jerome case twice used the label larceny for a description of crimes including false pretenses and pointed out that Congress did so in the legislative history to the 1934 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.555" offset="9954484">Thus, by 1937 to conclude mechanically and dogmatically that larceny means solely common law larceny and that takes and carries away means the same thing that it meant in the 18th century is to ignore the contemporary use of those words both common use and use as words of art.</text>

            <text syncTime="3343.804" offset="13519571">Sumner specifically addressed that issue saying he wanted to confine the extension of federal power to those situations where the need to supplement state and local law enforcing agencies had become imperative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.297" offset="13577459">It was an emergency-type statute to eliminate bank robberies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.966" offset="13592192">It is the bank robbery statute, not the thing that is covered by state law and the statute has not run on a state law in this case with regard to the fact that a man did commit a crime by false pretenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.633" offset="13650811">That is my whole point in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.086" offset="13660633">2113(b) is not an expansive statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.132" offset="13672858">It is a narrowly defined and specifically drawn federal statute that does not approach and control for that crime.</text>
