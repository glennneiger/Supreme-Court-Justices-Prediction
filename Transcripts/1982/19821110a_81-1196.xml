            <text syncTime="83.200" offset="474578">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="85.965" offset="485549">This case arises under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.038" offset="505925">On the basis of an allegation by the Plaintiff to his rights under the Eighth Amendment, made applicable through the Fourteenth, to be free from cruel and unusual punishment, this case then presents the issue of what is the proper standard for the award of punitive damages in an action under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.249" offset="594741">Last year in the case of City of Newport versus Fact Concerts, Incorporated, this Court stated that in a proper case under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983 punitive damages were available.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.243" offset="654718">The question now is what is a proper case.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.178" offset="670392">This had not been reached before because in the Newport case it was found that municipalities were actually immune.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.193" offset="698500">Although the issue was not directly reached and did not have to be reached, there was a very strong indication by this Court as to what the appropriate standard for punitive damages was.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.217" offset="750640">In the course of the opinion in that case this Court stated that a public official who knowingly and maliciously acts to deprive one of his civil rights is a proper subject for punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.836" offset="801109">This in turn echoes what this Court had said in the earlier opinion, about three years earlier, in Carey versus Piphus.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.631" offset="832247">Again, it was dicta.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.242" offset="838725">The issue of punitive damages was not strictly speaking before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.536" offset="855861">The Court did state that punitive damages would not have been an appropriate award under the circumstances in Carey because there was no evidence of a malicious intent to deprive of rights or to do injury.</text>

            <text syncTime="365.583" offset="1604008">Because there is so very little, in fact nothing much, said about the issue of damages pertaining to 1983, I think it is a rather fluid concept, and this Court--</text>

            <text syncTime="732.406" offset="3071358">No, not as the standard, because recklessness... this Court has indicated in the sense of qualified immunity that one knew or should have known that your actions were going to deprive someone of his constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.974" offset="3149621">And although in the context of that the Court has never specifically used the term "reckless" that I'm aware of, it seems to me that if one knew or should have known, that approaches being reckless if it isn't in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.094" offset="3194134">I think the Court then... the basic standard of liability is a reckless standard, and it was established at that level for a very particular reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.889" offset="3237288">In other words, it is not enough to say, well, the level is already high, you don't need to go any higher for punitive damages, because I think the level has been set high for a very specific reason, that reason being that for state officials who do exercise discretion and who are therefore entitled to the protection of qualified immunity, that the dangers of not acting or being inhibited in their actions can often be as great or greater than their actions themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.124" offset="3370199">The Court pointed out the dangers of punitive damages and their excessiveness and unpredictability in the Foust and Gertz cases cited in the Petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.464" offset="3407607">In those cases, the Court indicated that even if confident that punitive damages may not be available, that say the labor union in the Foust case could still feel compelled to pass up fair settlement offers or to pursue frivolous claims, actions which this Court described as not being in the best interests of the union members.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.562" offset="3496005">Similarly for state officials, their actions often affect many other people other than the Plaintiff who eventually sues them in a 1983 action.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.950" offset="3537487">In particular here, the Defendant was responsible not just for the safety of the Plaintiff; he was responsible for the safety of anywhere from 110 to 120 inmates in that particular unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.630" offset="3592240">And the decision he makes at any particular time regarding any one of them can affect the safety and well-being of all of them, and I think he needs to have the protection afforded by the qualified immunity to make that informed discretion decision without, as this Court has said, undue timidity.</text>

            <text syncTime="919.888" offset="3821282">Because if one cannot predict what is being prohibited or one does not know what is being prohibited, then it is very unlikely that one could be deterred.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.071" offset="3866003">Or if one does happen to avoid what is subsequently construed to be prohibited, then it is sheer happenstance, rather than the exercise of an informed decisionmaking.</text>

            <text syncTime="1120.638" offset="4624286">They said they were not indifferent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1144.124" offset="4718222">But I think when you look at the cases... and some of them cited in the briefs do involve decisions of correctional officers and officials dealing with custody status or transfers of inmates, which is essentially what we have here... that quite often you are presented with, in the words of one court, alternative Eighth Amendment claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.523" offset="4807770">In other words, someone makes a threat, the person against whom it is made comes to complain.</text>

            <text syncTime="1230.124" offset="5062202">As far as 1983, I'm not aware of any until this one, although I suppose there could have been some actions against municipalities or other governmental units that I might not be aware of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.444" offset="5123538">I think the need for a more explicit standard is not only to enhance the deterrence aspect of 1983, but it is even more important to limit what this Court has indicated is the possible abuse of punitive damages, which as this Court has indicated are not designed to compensate for any actual injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.997" offset="5229700">They are intended as a quasi-criminal fine of sorts and are often subject to abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.757" offset="5260733">This Court has indicated that they are subject to being used against unpopular views or against unpopular defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.144" offset="5294274">Unfortunately, in this day and age perhaps state defendants are unpopular.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.426" offset="5311411">But I think the Court has indicated that they are subject to severe abuse, and I think in a way a higher standard of conduct, one more readily understandable, I think, and perhaps more consistently understandable, might eliminate or at least reduce the possibility for abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.151" offset="5398346">An alternative argument is that if 1983 in all instances does not require an actual malice showing, I think it does in this instance, simply because as a general procedural or philosophical matter the courts always talk in terms of punitive damages being available for aggravating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.998" offset="5497716">I think the very use of the term "aggravating" implies a comparative analysis, two different levels of conduct, one being higher than the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.683" offset="5532407">As I stated earlier, the level of conduct in this case and applied as it is by qualified immunity was placed there for a very specific societal reason, and it was placed there because often the risks of not doing something are just as great as actually acting, and that the risk of error under those circumstances deserves some protection in making an informed decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.457" offset="5627597">I think it would undermine that policy if anything less than actual malice were to be implied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.156" offset="5658317">I also believe it would be inconsistent with this Court's opinion in Carey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.764" offset="5676811">In Carey this Court indicated that you could not presume damages, even assuming proof of a constitutional violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.621" offset="5712234">That being true, it seems to me we would simply be reaching the same result here by simply saying, well, they're punitive damages and not presumed damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.147" offset="5750268">But in either instance, Plaintiff is saying they should both... or the punitive damages should be on the same level or the same standard of liability as the actual damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.753" offset="5792691">And yet, presumed damages or punitive damages is neither one tied to the theory of compensation or to the extent of any actual injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.435" offset="5835427">It would seem to be that to award punitive damages on the same standard of conduct as that for the basic liability gets around and reaches the same result which was closed off in this Court's opinion in Carey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.384" offset="5887254">I believe, therefore, that both the policy of deterrence would neither be inhibited... because compensatory and the threat of attorney's fees in themselves carry with it a deterrent effect, as this Court has noted on previous occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.310" offset="5978996">To the extent that any further deterrence is appropriate under 1983, I think it is best served by as explicit a standard as possible, and I say that because, unlike either the attorney's fees or the compensatory damages, which are inherently limited by actual costs or actual damages, as this Court has noted on many occasions, punitive damages have no such inherent restriction and are essentially unlimited.</text>

            <text syncTime="2583.721" offset="10476655">You must look at the risk involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.455" offset="10487522">For example, in Carey the risk of real damages to these students in Carey was not very great.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.012" offset="10517824">They were going to leave school for a while, but there was no risk, for example, of physical injury or rape, the things that we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.496" offset="10555754">In this case you have a situation where a guard with plenty of objective facts behind him made a decision with deliberate indifference, callous disregard, of what was known to him about these individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.394" offset="10627329">It was similar or could be compared to putting two hungry lions in a small cage with a lamb.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.922" offset="10653451">Now, if the man turns his head on that we can't really say that he intended for the lions to eat the lamb, but by merely turning his head with these facts in front of him you must presume that he deliberately did not care what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.556" offset="10731923">And that is what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.851" offset="10745089">I think what we're also talking about is what one of the colleagues of the Defendant below referred to as a common sense standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.986" offset="10793677">He testified that it was just common sense that you don't place special treatment unit inmates in a 65 square foot cell with inmates from the general population.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.839" offset="10845086">Just common sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.794" offset="10848952">We're not talking about a higher plane.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.433" offset="10863476">We're not asking for this guard to review all of the constitutional law on the spot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.665" offset="10888345">We're asking him not to be careless.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.743" offset="10896704">We're asking him not to show a deliberate disregard for the health and safety of this particulate inmate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.490" offset="10931708">Your Honors, to overturn the decision below I believe this Court would in effect be taking away the admonition function of punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.558" offset="11007985">And I want to draw the Court's attention to a hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.134" offset="11030242">If the facts of this case show that Elijah Smith, with the same guard on duty in the same dormitory, with somewhat similar circumstances, was beaten to death only a few months before this happened, if on the night that Danny Wade was raped d beaten he would have been killed, his actual damages under Missouri law or the actual damages for his family would have been very small, because they would have been limited to what he could have provided for them in supports.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.621" offset="11168168">And it's unrealistic to suppose an 18 year old in prison with a felony record is going to provide much in the way of support for his family outside the prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.398" offset="11207352">But without actual damages there would be no real deterrence for these guards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.895" offset="11241311">In other words, there comes a time... or I mean, substantial actual damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.940" offset="11265448">There comes a time when actual damages can be so low, the possibility of them can be so low, that a guard or someone else in that position may decide to take the risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.118" offset="11330232">In other words, it would be cheaper for him to pay the actual damages and violate the constitutional rights than it would be for him to apply some new policy or make a more careful decision, or in this case place Danny Wade in a cell downstairs with only one other inmate who is from the special treatment unit rather than in a cell with two inmates who had come from the general population.</text>

            <text syncTime="2921.708" offset="11828544">But I saw time and time again in the debates before the Act of 1871 and its predecessor in 1866 the problem of state officials turning their backs on the rights of innocent citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.922" offset="11893432">And it is my belief that this concern, along with the common law that existed at the time, must be read in such a way that they intended for punitive damages to be available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.134" offset="11962291">And again, the damages were not actually discussed, at least where I could find it, in the legislative debates, but the policy of deterrence certainly was, and the policy of deterrence in civil rights actions, of course, has been mentioned by this Court time and time again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.017" offset="12041807">Your Honors, again I want to perhaps clarify something and distinguish this case from Carey.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.668" offset="12072423">In Carey the Plaintiff had to show that he was deprived of a right under color of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.478" offset="12103665">He had to show negligence, that they knew or should have known that his right was being violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.850" offset="12129161">And then to reach punitive damages, because he had no actuals, he had to show some sort of actual malice, which has been defined as ill will, spite or reckless disregard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.424" offset="12175450">Here, instead of a three-step process, because of the particular qualified immunity for prison officials we had to show a deprivation of a constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.263" offset="12222784">But because of the qualified immunity we had to show that this deprivation occurred because of a callous indifference, an egregious failure, if you will, a deliberate indifference to known threats to health and safety, recklessness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.820" offset="12289030">In other words, we met that punitive damage standard as soon as we met the standard for actual damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="3247.984" offset="13133621">I might add, though, that he did not, as you can see in instruction 5 on page 13 of the appendix, he did not leave the definitions of such things as gross negligence and egregious failure to the imagination of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.523" offset="13195793">He defined them, I believe, with the appropriate federal standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.475" offset="13207600">The same way with instruction number 7, which appears on page 14, which is the punitive damage instruction, where he refers to a callous or reckless disregard or indifference to the rights and safety of others.</text>

            <text syncTime="3290.683" offset="13304462">The Respondent has gotten a little bit into the facts of the case, and I don't want to dwell on them too much, but I do feel that a brief response on my part would be appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.820" offset="13348975">First of all, the Respondent's characterization of placing a lamb in with two lions, his reference to what one guard called a common sense rule about not putting a protective custody inmate in with those from general population, are not the sole... are not the complete picture in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.937" offset="13433507">The Plaintiff was in the administrative segregation unit because of conduct violations in the protective custody unit to begin with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.151" offset="13470287">In other words, once he had requested to get into protective custody he was then charged himself with harassing and threatening inmates in that unit, and that was the disciplinary charge that got him into administrative segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.332" offset="13519084">As far as the death of the other inmate a few months previous, on which this same guard did happen to be on duty at the time, again there is nothing in the record to indicate that was a result of any personal fault of that guard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.924" offset="13569448">It took place at a time when there were only two inmates in the cell.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.860" offset="13585122">It took place during shower period, when there were two guards but both of them happened to be supervising the inmates during their shower period because the inmates were obviously out of the cell at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.854" offset="13633187">In other words, there was no indication that this had any rational connection between the later events involving the Plaintiff here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.040" offset="13661922">It seems to me, your Honor, that the plaintiff's then argument that low damages would encourage someone to take a chance is really unsupportable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.517" offset="13715838">In Robertson versus Wegmann this Court dealt with a Louisiana statute on survivorship under which certain actions might abate, and the argument was made, well, this would undermine deterrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.438" offset="13755440">In other words, they could say, well, this might abate, I'll take the chance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.606" offset="13772158">This Court rejected that as an unlikely possibility and I think it's equally unlikely that a state official would sit around and say, well, I consider damages unlikely here in any great amount, I'll take a chance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.069" offset="13822000">That is just too iffy a proposition and I don't believe that this Court can indulge the assumption that that would happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.269" offset="13846764">It appears to me in the final analysis that what we want to ensure is a most appropriate imposition of punitive damages, and I think a higher standard is conducive with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.563" offset="13907995">And I think it is analogous to what this Court said in Santosky versus Kramer, that a higher standard of proof ensures or places the fact-finder on notice that this is an important decision and helps to limit the possibility of an inappropriate decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.726" offset="13972674">For that reason I believe an actual malice standard is necessary.</text>
