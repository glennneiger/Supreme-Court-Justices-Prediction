            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="6.784" offset="119359">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit that involves beepers.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.181" offset="148929">A beeper is a radio transmitter which emits periodic signals that can be picked up by a radio receiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.498" offset="178187">In this case, Minnesota police officers arranged with a seller of chemicals to install a beeper inside a five-gallon container of chloroform.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.460" offset="218102">Chloroform can be used in manufacturing illegal drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.323" offset="233566">After the container was sold, the police followed its movements.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.372" offset="249762">It changed hands once but by maintaining contact through visual surveillance and monitoring the beeper signal, the police were able to track the chloroform container across the St. Croix River and then to Wisconsin to respondent's secluded cabin near Shell Lake, Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.025" offset="320293">A subsequent search of the cabin pursuant to a warrant revealed an illegal drug traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.153" offset="348818">We've been asked to decide whether the monitoring of the beeper violated any reasonable expectation of privacy held by respondent thus running afoul of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.053" offset="388420">We have concluded that it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.490" offset="398242">The surveillance in this case was directed to the following of an automobile on public streets and highways and to its departure from the highway onto respondent's privately owned premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.734" offset="439202">A person travelling on public thoroughfares could not reasonably expect that his movements on those thoroughfares and his departure from them will not be observed by others.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.360" offset="477654">Everything learned by the police officers in this case could have been learned by visual surveillance from public places.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.741" offset="503254">The fact that the officers augmented their sensory facilities with such enhancement as science and technology afford does not require any different constitutional analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.818" offset="547558">Because of our view that monitoring the beeper signals did not invade any legitimate expectation of privacy on respondent's part, we have concluded that there was neither a search nor a seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment and we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.132" offset="608789">Justice Brennan has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment which Justice Marshall has joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.231" offset="629165">Justice Blackmun has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment which Justice Brennan, Justice Marshall, and Justice Stevens joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.214" offset="657063">Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment which Justice Brennan and Justice Marshall joined.</text>
