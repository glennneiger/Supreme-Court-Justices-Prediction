            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="8.683" offset="126995">This case involves a California Franchise Tax and is here on Appeal from the Court of Appeals of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.965" offset="168164">That Court sustained a tax levied under California's Franchise Tax Act against appellant, Container Corporation, rejecting Container's argument that the tax as applied to it violated the Due Process and Commerce Clause -- Clauses of the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.192" offset="249039">During the tax years involve, Container Corporation controlled some 20 foreign subsidiaries located in four Latin American and four European countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.841" offset="311628">The California franchise tax returns filed by Container admitted, however, to include any income of these subsidiaries and also omitted all of its subsidiaries, payroll, property and sales in calculating the share of its net income which was apportionable to California under that Franchise Tax Acts three-factor formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.471" offset="434090">California took the position that Container should have treated its overseas subsidiaries as part of its unitary business rather than as a passive investment and increased Container's tax liability accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.032" offset="508382">Container then paid the additional amounts under protest and sued in California Superior Court for a refund, raising the constitutional challenges the increased tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.479" offset="566165">The Superior Court upheld California's assessment -- assessment and the California Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.152" offset="600856">And we in turn affirm the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.174" offset="616947">The opinion we have filed doesn't readily land itself to oral announcement and I'll therefore only briefly state our holdings that lead to our conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.829" offset="667520">First, we hold that California's application of the unitary business principle to Container and its foreign subsidiaries was proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.765" offset="707331">Second, we hold that California's use of the three-factor formula of payroll, property, and sales to apportion the income of the unitary business consisting of Container and its subsidiaries was fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.877" offset="771801">Third, we hold that California had no obligation under the Foreign Commerce Clause to employ the arm's length analysis used by the Federal Government and most foreign nations in evaluating the tax consequences of intercorporate relationships.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.610" offset="846720">Fourth, we hold that the double taxation occasioned by the California scheme is not constitutionally impermissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.547" offset="882456">Fifth and finally, we hold that the California tax does not violate the one voice standard under which a state tax at variance with federal policy will be struck down if it either implicates foreign policy issues which must be left to the Federal Government or violates a clear federal directive.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.321" offset="969496">Justice Powell joined by the Chief Justice and Justice O'Connor has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
