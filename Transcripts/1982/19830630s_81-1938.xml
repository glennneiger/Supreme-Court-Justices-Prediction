            <text syncTime="6.711" offset="119045">It's here on certiorari to the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.117" offset="132734">It involves the same rules that were involved in the Sells case, disclosure of grand jury materials for civil uses is permitted by Federal Rule, and I quote from the Rule, "When so directed by a court preliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding."</text>
            <text syncTime="33.164" offset="224894">And the question in this case is whether an Internal Revenue Service investigation to determine a taxpayer's civil tax liability is within the meaning of the rule preliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.868" offset="291767">And we agree with the Court of Appeals that it is not and affirmed the judgment of that Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.128" offset="316740">Our reasons are detailed in an opinion filed today with the clerk.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.255" offset="333249">The Chief Justice dissents and has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
