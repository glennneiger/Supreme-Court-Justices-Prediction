            <text syncTime="84.701" offset="479075">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="86.746" offset="487225">The Commonwealth of Massachusetts appears here today seeking reversal of orders entered by the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts on August 7, 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.774" offset="539366">We thus seek the same result as the Union Petitioners in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.442" offset="558069">To accomplish that result, however, we bring a different appeal and different arguments before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.486" offset="586177">We appeal from the unjustified suspension of a Massachusetts law that requires that layoffs in public safety positions be made in reverse order of seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.514" offset="626301">After briefly stating these cases, it is my intention to argue that the District Court abused its discretion by suspending that law where no previous orders or decrees entered in these cases concerned layoffs and where entry of the orders contradicted principles of federalism that govern the exercise of the federal equity power.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.285" offset="725357">The orders at issues were entered in on-going cases with long judicial histories and state-wide application.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.890" offset="763810">Ten years ago the District Courts in these cases entered judgments and found that state examination procedures for police and fire positions unintentionally, and I repeat, unintentionally violated the rights of the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.024" offset="828384">Remedial orders were entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.321" offset="837579">Those orders required a new examination and also required preferential certification of minorities to local cities and towns.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.207" offset="877077">As a result of the preferential certifications, the percentage of minorities in Massachusetts city and town police and fired forces increased substantially.</text>

            <text syncTime="860.427" offset="3582004">Before proceeding to my view of the issue, if I could respond to some of the questions that had been posed with respect to the seniority remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.112" offset="3616695">In effect, upon reinstatement, because the officers had been laid off for fiscal reasons, they did regain all their seniority back to date of permanent appointment.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.139" offset="3664864">In that case, the seniority issue, in terms of relief that they are presently seeking before the state agency, dropped out of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.714" offset="3699137">There is a very serious back pay issue that is involved and it is one which the Civil Service Commission is asked to rule upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.708" offset="3743127">As long as the District Court's August 7, 1981 order does exist, the Civil Service Commission cannot rule upon that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.203" offset="3785028">I would submit to you as a matter of equities as to who should bear the particular loss, the City of Boston or the laid-off officers if, in fact, the seniority suppression was not valid, that should be an issue left best to the Civil Service Commission of Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.586" offset="3858588">There are a variety of Civil Service appeals which have come up, including a police officer, superior officer's appeal, which, I believe, Justice O'Connor referenced in her question and that order, if I recall it, was based on the fact that the City of Boston had used a political manipulation to lay off a small number of police officers in another group not represented by the union before you today.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.479" offset="3998187">In effect, I think the Civil Service Commission was stating that they found that there was a political discrimination involved in that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.756" offset="4035281">I have not looked at it and I apologize if I have not quoted it correctly, but my recollection is that it was based on a different series of proofs than would be involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.735" offset="4099228">If I could return to my argument, the unions submit that the issue before you is whether a federal court in an employment discrimination case can grant increased, competitive job security to junior minority firefighters who were not, who were not victims of past acts of discrimination by suppressing a bona fide seniority statute requiring seniority layoffs to the detriment of senior non-minority firefighters who were then terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.800" offset="4223467">I would submit that this judicial override should be reversed on statutory grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.282" offset="4237364">If the statutory grounds are not persuasive, this judicial override should fail for reasons found in the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.560" offset="4274458">May I note that under current law there are no constitutional violations that are present on the record before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.808" offset="4303506">Certainly Washington v. Davis has now established that in order to have a Fourteenth Amendment violation there would have to be purposeful, deliberate discrimination shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.256" offset="4361289">That is not the case before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.396" offset="4369857">The plaintiffs... I am sorry, the respondents made no challenge either to Section 39, the Massachusetts Seniority Statute, or to layoffs by its terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.515" offset="4418340">They made no further assertion of any new civil rights violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.545" offset="4438402">I would submit to you that in framing relief the District Court cannot disregard the congressional policies enacted in Section 703(h) of Title VII, protecting and conserving earned seniority rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.147" offset="4504858">I submit to you that that statute extends an immunity to routine applications of seniority systems irrespective of disparate impacts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1107.796" offset="4571418">Your Honor, there were two actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.390" offset="4577792">In the police case, the police decision had been adjudicated prior to the effective date of Title VII's application to municipalities and local governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.665" offset="4634948">In the firefighter case, the plaintiffs', private plaintiffs' complaint originally asserted only violations of the Fourteenth Amendment in Sections 1981 and 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.707" offset="4691059">That complaint was filed in November of 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.001" offset="4712270">The United States filed a complaint repeating those same grounds and asserting a Title VII ground in February of 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.154" offset="4752917">The focus in both complaints was upon examinations conducted no later than August 1971 and on recruitment techniques.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.930" offset="4804012">It may be that one could argue that there was never a Title VII violation ever present in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.504" offset="4842255">However, I have to note that the record would also show that in April of 1972 a Boston eligibility list was established from the August 1971 exam and some 86 non-minority firefighter appointments were made prior to the filing of the plaintiffs' complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.196" offset="4949044">Thereafter, the state agencies voluntarily ceased using that list so that there may be a Title VII connection in that respect, but the parties never focused on it in litigation and the theories in both cases, as they were stated by the District Court, were on the Fourteenth Amendment and on the Constitution, not Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.580" offset="5026575">But, even if there is a constitutional basis to this case, I would conclude that the Section 1988 of 42 US Code would require a District Court to shape relief in an employment case based on constitutional grounds according to other federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.383" offset="5105779">Such other federal law should be Section 703(h).</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.570" offset="5114556">You are really redressing, in the constitutional sense, individually violations and only individual rights can be violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.363" offset="5157710">I think then that you would use the same sort of constructive seniority approach that this Court has approved in Franks and approved again in Teamsters and has commented on several times, most recently in Ford Motor Company and in Zipes, in order to extend rightful place relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.604" offset="5238690">So, even under the Constitution or Title VII, I think you come to the same result, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.494" offset="5258229">In this case, the District Court did establish four priority pools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.379" offset="5297831">The first priority pool, the Group A, consisted of all persons who took the August 1971 or earlier examination and failed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.563" offset="5338477">The second pool, with which we are concerned, is the Group C.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.857" offset="5363659">That consisted of all non-minority persons who could not qualify for admission into Groups A but who had passed a new examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.244" offset="5401276">I would submit that those persons who were Group C were not victims of any discrimination, any act of discrimination, and that the conferral of a random benefit upon them without establishing any victim identification was not only inconsistent with this Court's decision in Teamsters, but, indeed, it bears upon the claim that the disadvantaged senior firefighters have that their rights were invaded by the order in the sense that they lost an equal protection component that the possessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.570" offset="5578595">May I add that the particular order benefit only persons who were not victims of racial discrimination or identified as victims of racial discrimination; that a use of a racial classification should only be approved, if it ever can be approved, when it is used as a remedy for a person who is a victim of past identified discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.883" offset="5719761">In this case, that surely was not the use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.867" offset="5731777">Instead, and I think both the District Court and the Court of Appeals' opinions reflect this fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.006" offset="5764273">At the August 30... I am sorry, the July 30, 1981 hearing before the District Court, and if I could paraphrase the District Court, they said that the only issue before the house is an issue of numbers, whether we were going to keep a certain number, whether we were going to decrease a certain number or whether we were going to increase a certain number.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.744" offset="5863225">We heard arguments on all the other issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.650" offset="5870853">That was the focus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.431" offset="5877958">It was on percentages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.650" offset="5882869">Again, the Court of Appeals' opinion states that the purpose of the orders was to maintain a semblance of racial balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.974" offset="5916201">I would submit to you that a purpose in that direction is constitutionally invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.582" offset="5942637">Finally, I would ask the Court to look again at the impact of the orders in terms of any constitutional justification for the orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.248" offset="5981299">The impact wasn't dispersed among some amorphous population.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.466" offset="5998121">It fell on 83 non-minority firefighters, 96 non-minority police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.947" offset="6036051">And, if I can go outside the record for a moment, it actually fell on 123 non-minority firefighters, yet they are indistinguishable in terms of advantage of obtaining that employment, in terms of the risks in the kind of employment in which they were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.126" offset="6112747">They are indistinguishable from the beneficiaries of those orders save in two respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.514" offset="6138347">The disadvantage individuals did not share a preferred racial characteristic and they were senior.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.698" offset="6171052">I have concluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.510" offset="6174291">Thank you very much.</text>

            <text syncTime="1522.317" offset="6229566">Because the Court voiced almost with one voice a concern about mootness, I would like to address that issue briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.923" offset="6263943">It is a threshold issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.204" offset="6269063">As the suggestion of mootness, which we incorporated in our brief in the merits, indicates we view this case to be moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.950" offset="6300097">A Massachusetts' Act of 1982, Chapter 190 which was passed approximately one month after the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court decision, mandates that all officers in both departments who were discharged during the reduction-in-force program in 1981 be rehired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.411" offset="6377942">It also, modifying what would otherwise be standard principles of Civil Service law, specifies that all of these individuals who were laid off and then rehired have lifetime job security from layoffs for lack of funds or reduction-in-force programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.405" offset="6441890">In addition, the City of Boston has begun rehiring additional officers over the last approximately nine months under mandates also coming from that same statute to raise and maintain levels of staffing in the two departments.</text>

            <text syncTime="2316.626" offset="9406788">The District Court in both of these cases in the early 1970's adjudicated that minorities had been unconstitutionally excluded from these two departments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.650" offset="9458823">A remedial program was put in place in order to correct the effects, the condition of exclusion which these past practices have brought about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.739" offset="9507202">The city and the state Civil Service officials were bound to participate in that remedial program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.237" offset="9537191">It was an order of the Court to remedy this condition which the discrimination had accomplished and ultimately they entered into consent orders with respect to both of the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.842" offset="9587659">The program was on-going when, in the summer of 1981, the City of Boston proposed and started implementing a program such that in six weeks approximately one-half of all Black and Hispanic firemen in the City of Boston and one-half of all Black and Hispanic police officers were going to be laid off.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.316" offset="9685566">Another way of putting it is approximately one-half of all of the officers in both departments who had been hired under the remedial phase yet to be completed ordered by the Court were going to be laid off.</text>

            <text syncTime="2420.006" offset="9820254">I believe the order was proper and the issue before the Court on the merits is whether the District Court had the power to issue such an order to maintain and protect and promote the original purposes of its remedial orders going back to the original adjudications of liability and whether, in this particular instance on the matters and record before the Court, there was a sound and proper exercise of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.574" offset="9926520">I believe the answer to both questions is the Court had its power, had the power and the Court properly exercised discretion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2797.871" offset="11331803">And, in fact, given the results over the years, even since the original decrees, of those examinations under EEOC standards, they would be prima facie invalid exams.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.647" offset="11378823">In a sense, almost every minority applicant and ultimately hiree during the course of remediation here has been a victim of the same type of discrimination that prompted this litigation at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.095" offset="11436606">But, the point that I would like to make is confronted back in the early 1970's with governmental practices which had resulted in an exclusion, a dramatic, virtually wholesale exclusion of minorities from public service, public safety forces and then confronted with an effort in 1981 to go back a great half step of the whole step that had been taken, what was the proper extent of the power of the federal court to effect a remedy?</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.391" offset="11597834">And, I believe the proper extent is defined by a number of the opinions of the Justices of this Court indicating that race conscious, affirmative, if you will, remedies, without requiring nose counting proof of individual victimization, are appropriate where there has been an adjudication by a competent tribunal looking at the specific situation which is going to be affected by the remedial measure that there has been unconstitutional discrimination and that we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.017" offset="11744329">We have it in the original findings of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.391" offset="11757808">The Court chose at the outset a remedial measure designed not to leap over everyone who was already there and give the minorities who had been discriminated against their rightful place, not even to go out and find all of the minorities who had been excluded, but to work some balance and that balance was an affirmative action program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.646" offset="11862820">And, I suggest that is an appropriate balance for a court to strike in issuing a remedial or designing a remedial program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.876" offset="11899810">And, that program was in effect for a number of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.624" offset="11914752">It was on-going.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.124" offset="11920812">The parties were committed to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.342" offset="11933664">Then, in 1981, the City of Boston, one of the parties to that program, backed out and said one-half of everyone who has been hired we are going to lay off in six weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.477" offset="11994164">And, the Court at that time took what I believe was another flexible step to preserve the remedial program which was incomplete and to promote the original objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.534" offset="12050379">It didn't advance the interests of Blacks and Hispanics over whites in absolute numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.640" offset="12078801">It didn't prohibit any layoffs of minorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.498" offset="12094265">The burden of the layoff program which was instituted by the City of Boston fell on minorities as well as on white officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.369" offset="12141703">The Court did not take away from the City of Boston or the state civil service officials for that matter their powers and prerogatives to make the decisions that they felt were appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.800" offset="12199486">The Court did not... The City of Boston, by the way, and its Police Commissioner and its Fire Commissioner did not oppose the relief that we sought in the District Court, did not participate in the appeal even and are obviously not before this Court today.</text>

            <text syncTime="3036.479" offset="12286213">The program was a balanced program to the extent to which the Court's order addressed the operation of a civil service system.</text>

            <text syncTime="3188.152" offset="12892881">It is appropriate for third parties to share that burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.916" offset="12911898">It didn't fall all on them as I have pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.431" offset="12922033">Minorities were laid off and the Court was careful to preserve as much as possible the provisions of the state civil service seniority scheme of things in the event of the very kind of thing which happened which was the political solution to these problems which was frustrated until the day after the District Court order came down was ultimately lifted and a resolution was found.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.329" offset="13021612">Seniority expectations after all are not vested rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.122" offset="13040734">In Massachusetts they are defeasible at any time by will of the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.635" offset="13066856">We don't have involved here collective bargaining agreements which is the fruit of collective bargaining efforts or organized labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.913" offset="13095904">We don't have an interference with national policies favoring collective bargaining arrangements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.692" offset="13123072">In short, the extent of burden that the order places on others is within the permissible scope of the District Court and the District Court took care not to step any further than it had to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.623" offset="13194752">I would like to just conclude by pointing out that the efforts in this country through legal measures to eradicate several hundreds years of race discrimination are not many years old, barely 25 years, and one of the hallmarks of what this Court has done by way of giving direction to the lower courts is to vest the lower courts with flexibility to deal with the very difficult circumstances, practical, political, and economic, that they face.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.733" offset="13335186">I believe that the District Court and the Court of Appeals in this case exercised that kind of flexibility wisely and I urge the Court to affirm and not deprive the lower courts of the needed flexibility to meet this pressing national challenge.</text>
