            <label>Mr. Joe L. Tucker, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="227.327" offset="1054823">--Well, Your Honor, I state this based on not only... with regard to indigent services, that may be true.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.728" offset="1108426">But in our case, the allegations were going not just to services for the indigent, but to the general public as a whole; paying persons as well as those on Medicaid, and drugs being purchased by Medicaid.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.974" offset="1165373">This case began in 1978 when Jefferson County Pharmaceutical Association filed suit in the United States District Court of the Northern District of Alabama seeking injunctive relief and treble damages against 15 drug manufacturers, and Jefferson County and the Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama Medical School.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.757" offset="1276551">The two hospitals, Jefferson County's charitable institution, Cooper Green Hospital, and the University of Alabama Hospita were operating pharmacies in direct competition with private retail pharmacists.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.219" offset="1358366">I think it's important to note where the pharmacy was with regard to the one operated by the University of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.339" offset="1394833">The University of Alabama Medical Center has a hospital and that hospital has a pharmacy approximately on the 15th and 16th floors.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.382" offset="1439032">That pharmacy was not the one selling drugs to the general public, but a separate pharmacy located away from the hospital, at street level, nice, comfortable chairs in the lobby for people to come in and wait on their prescriptions to be filled off the street, the general public, to be served.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.967" offset="1517400">All of the defendants filed motions to dismiss claiming that the sales to governmental agencies were exempt from the application of the Robinson-Patman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.290" offset="1562644">The district court ruled in favor of the defendants and held that sales to the county and state agencies' pharmacies were beyond the reach of the Robinson-Patman Price Discrimination Act without regard to 15 USC 13c, which is the Non-Profit Exemption Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.343" offset="1646862">Petitioner appealed to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, now the Eleventh Circuit, and that court affirmed the district court without opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.452" offset="1687300">Just noting the decision of the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.558" offset="1703705">However, Judge Clark wrote a dissenting opinion stating that the court had created a near-exemption to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.725" offset="1748426">He stated that this exemption allowed governmental agencies to compete in the private, proprietary sector of commerce, and use its superior buying power against businessmen operating private retail drug stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.392" offset="1807045">First of all, purchases for resale that's the key here in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.151" offset="1858141">This case is very similar, of course, to Abbott Laboratories versus Portland Retail Druggists Association, where this Court held that the Robinson-Patman Act applied to sales to private hospitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.910" offset="1925119">That case, of course, did not reach the issue here where that case, as I understand it, there were not it was not before this Court the issue of governmental agencies selling to general public.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.465" offset="2007352">The antitrust laws do apply to anti-competitive conduct of state and local governments when engaged in proprietary functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.757" offset="2044551">This has been cited in the City of Lafayette versus Louisiana Power where this Court held that the word "persons" as used in the antitrust laws, includes states and their political subdivisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="862.941" offset="3597269">It appears, from the cases, that certainly, an exemption should not be carved out.</text>

            <text syncTime="874.998" offset="3645543">And there is an exemption for private, non-profit hospitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.544" offset="3667695">That exemption, the Non-Profit Institution Act, in fact, does cover governmental agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.542" offset="3691623">But the legislative history supports our position that purchases by state and county agencies are covered by the Act when those agencies use those goods in competition with private retail pharmacies, rather than consuming them for their own use.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.848" offset="3756929">I'd point to Mr. Teegarden's testimony in the petitioner's brief on the merits, pages 9 and 10, page 12, pages 15 and 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.967" offset="3809383">There, Mr. Teegarden explained that the state or federal government, whichever, is saved by its function.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.946" offset="3849298">That is, it was never envisioned that the state or the federal government would be in competition with private enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.880" offset="3885034">That they would take on this anti-competitive nature and compete with private enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.206" offset="3918366">He stated that the reason they were not subject to the Robinson-Patman Act, in his testimony, was because they were not in competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.718" offset="3960371">He went on to say that if a city hospital competed with a privately-owned hospital that it would be subjected to the proscriptions of the Robinson-Patman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.883" offset="4013034">So certainly, the legislative history of Mr. Teegarden when he was testifying before the Senate or House committee, covered this area.</text>

            <text syncTime="1405.940" offset="5769298">Nine of the defendants... and in fact, one of those defendants is Cooper Green Hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.686" offset="5796257">Cooper Green Hospital, in my opinion, by filing this amendment, concedes that the Act applies by claiming the exemption under 13c.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.305" offset="5838680">The attorneys general of California and Georgia have held that the Robinson-Patman Act applies to governmental bodies when they act in competition with private enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.116" offset="5877968">These opinions of the attorneys general are referred to in our brief at page 13 and pages 14 and 15 of the Amicus Brief of the National Association of Retail Druggists.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.125" offset="5930004">In the case referred to by the Georgia attorney general, the state was running a factory for the blind, and in that opinion, the attorney general found that the Robinson-Patman Act did not apply to sales by that factory for the blind because they were... the sales were made to state agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.223" offset="6038360">But he went on to say that the factory for the blind would divest itself of its sovereignty if it acted in a proprietary interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.828" offset="6084857">That is, if it sold goods out of that factory to the general public, if it got outside of sales to state agencies and to the state itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.042" offset="6121638">Once it got outside that sphere, then its sales would be subject to the Robinson-Patman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.180" offset="6154239">Further, I would point to the opinion of the district court which is relied upon by the court of appeals, and would say that the cases and other authorities cited by the district court do not support its ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.783" offset="6232606">Each and every of the cases cited as authority by the district court did not consider the issue of whether or not sales by governmental agencies were being made to the general public in direct competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.836" offset="6300838">None of those cases and none of those citations considered that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.914" offset="6317138">The case of General Shale versus Struck which I've already mentioned was one of the cases relied upon by Judge Pointer of the Northern District of Alabama, in that case there was no sale of brick.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.863" offset="6372936">Further, the brick was used by the City of Louisville, Kentucky for its own use in building a housing project.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.985" offset="6409403">And thus, since there was no sale and it was for their own use, there was no competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.714" offset="6436361">Further, another case cited by the district court, Gulf Oil versus Copp, turned on the fact that there was no interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.041" offset="6477635">So that case is inapplicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.210" offset="6490382">The case of Logan Lanes versus Brunswick.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.800" offset="6500727">That's a Ninth Circuit case that affirmed the district court's dismissal of a plaintiff's case against Brunswick on the basis that the Non-Profit Institutions Act applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.484" offset="6563421">Because the Non-Profit Institutions Act applied and the state university was using the bowling lanes were for their own use, again, they were exempt because of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.242" offset="6606471">Further, the attorneys general's opinions cited by the district court did not consider purchases that were being made for the purpose of resale by state and local agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.926" offset="6669164">They did not consider the factor of competition with private enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.394" offset="6691107">The opinions of the... I might add, too, that the opinion of the Attorney General of the United States speaks to purchases by federal government and not to state and local agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.089" offset="6737814">And I think that's the key difference there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.699" offset="6752338">The opinions of the attorneys general of Minnesota, Wisconsin and North Carolina were cited by the district court, but again, in each of these opinions, it was not considered... there was no consideration as to whether or not there was competition with private enterprise.</text>

            <label>Mr. David Klingsberg</label>
            <text syncTime="1709.081" offset="6981798">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.486" offset="6995486">This case presents the question of whether sales to state and local government agencies are within the coverage of the Robinson-Patman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.029" offset="7041566">I respectfully suggest that the petitioner has drawn the issue too narrowly, and that in interpreting congressional intent as to whether the Robinson-Patman Act covered state and local government agency purchases and looking at the language of the Act, it can't simply be limited to drugs, it can't simply be limited to hospitals and it can't simply be limited to the state of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.187" offset="7154206">But rather, it deals with the entire spectrum of government agencies, a great many of which purchase commodities and purchase commodities which are covered by the Robinson-Patman Act if indeed the Act was applicable, whether they're sold for use or for consumption or resale under the terms of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.226" offset="7246366">Therefore, a very far-reaching assertion is being made here by the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.222" offset="7270399">Our position, based on legislative history, judicial decisions and the unanimous view of the commentators, including Representative Patman, is that Congress did not intend to apply the Robinson-Patman Act to purchases by state and governmental agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.779" offset="7348662">I would like, if I may, to concentrate on two main points; one, the statutory scheme as reflected in the Robinson-Patman Act of 1936 and the Non-Profit Institutions Act of 1938, which we say is logical and consistent only if the earlier statute, the original Robinson-Patman Act, is read as the legislative history indicates; not to reach purchases of governmental agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.107" offset="7473945">And this conclusion is buttressed by Congress's rejection in 1951 and 1953 of specific proposed amendments which were not enacted to extend the statute's reach to purchases by states and their political subdivisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.006" offset="7545520">And thereafter, Congress failed to act despite more than 40 years of uniform enforcement agency recognition--</text>

            <text syncTime="1901.543" offset="7751679">--Well, in the committee... in a written brief which Mr. Teegarden submitted, he was asked the question: would the bill prevent competitive bidding on government purchases below trade price levels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.694" offset="7816253">And he answered that question first by saying that as a matter of statutory construction he would think that it would not be covered, and he assured Congress that it wouldn't be covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.330" offset="7862856">And then he said a further reason was the effect on competition because of the requirements relating to secondary line competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.529" offset="7899636">I should point out, Your Honor, that the Robinson-Patman Act as ultimately passed also has a primary line provision in which there would be liability where there is a sale to a state, for example, if indeed the states were covered, and there is no effect on competition by the state or the city or the municipality with some drug store or retailer, but there was an effect on competition at the primary line level between the sellers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.408" offset="8027114">And so on that basis, it would seem that the resale or the competition are not, by the state, would not, under the terms of the statute, have anything to do with whether the Act applies or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.429" offset="8083225">And Mr. Teegarden's written report indicates the categorical elimination of applicability and assurance to the congressmen who were concerned as to whether or not the states and municipalities could continue their practice of competitive bidding and buy, in the words of Congressman Hancock who asked one of the questions, at the cheapest prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.330" offset="8178833">Congress was concerned that the states and cities be able to purchase at the cheapest prices and continue the practice, which they have today, of buying at prices as the question asked in the written report says, below trade price levels.</text>

            <text syncTime="2054.590" offset="8363884">The whole controversy was raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.700" offset="8372348">And as a matter of fact, Mr. Kintner, who is counsel to National Association of Retail Druggists who is one of the principal amici here, told the congressman on that occasion that there were three categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.601" offset="8427937">One category was government, and that was not covered by the Robinson-Patman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.285" offset="8446640">The second category was charitable eleemosynary institutions, and that category was covered by the Robinson-Patman Act but given a partial exemption under the Non-Profit Institution Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.983" offset="8501393">The Non-Profit Institution Act did not apply to government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.059" offset="8517693">And the congressional subcommittee adopted that, quoted it in its report and... to find the Non-Profit Institution Act as only applying to private charitable institutions, and concluded after extensive hearings at which it was brought out that there's competition between drug stores and hospital pharmacies and so forth, there was testimony by pharmaceutical manufacturers that went on for weeks... concluded that what should be done is the administrative agencies should enforce the Robinson-Patman Act as against the non-profit, non-governmental private charitable hospitals where they don't meet the requirements of the 1938 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.400" offset="8715075">But never concluded and was never even asked by the National Association of Retail Druggists to extend the basic Robinson-Patman Act to cover governmental purchases.</text>

            <text syncTime="2180.946" offset="8869302">Now, inherent in what I've been saying, if Your Honors please, is that to appreciate the logic of the statutory scheme, you have to look both at the 1936 Act and the 1938 amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.392" offset="8939101">My proposition is that the 1938 amendment did not exempt governmental bodies because they were not covered by the Robinson-Patman Act to begin with, and any other construction would be illogical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.824" offset="9004825">By its terms, the 1938 amendment provided for exemption of non-profit institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.946" offset="9033246">Now, that's not a term which is ordinarily applied to government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.833" offset="9048815">It's not the term which Congress used in 1951 and 1953 when they proposed amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.550" offset="9079744">The called the state the states and political subdivision states political subdivisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.814" offset="9100746">The Non-Profit Institutions Act applies to purchases for own use by schools, colleges, universities, public libraries, churches, hospitals and charitable institutions, not operating for profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.073" offset="9161769">Now, charitable institutions and churches are plainly not government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.898" offset="9181099">Others, schools, libraries and hospitals theoretically encompass both governmental and non-government owned bodies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.177" offset="9218193">Schools can be private.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.768" offset="9224567">So can hospitals, and as to libraries, despite the footnote in the Lafayette case which respectfully, we say is wrong, libraries can, I was very interested to find out, be privately run, privately endowed, open to the public libraries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.731" offset="9292381">And there are thousands of libraries like that in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.635" offset="9308054">Now, if governmental purchases were intended to be covered by the 1938 exemption, a logical legislature surely would have included other types of governmental buyers.</text>

            <text syncTime="3158.970" offset="12781400">There was testimony by numerous representatives of the drug industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.016" offset="12801566">A year later there was testimony by wholesalers, but automotive industry people, all saying that the Robinson-Patman Act does not apply to governmental purchases, and that there are a lot of instances in a variety of industries where government competes, and Congress's only reaction to that was to... the Subcommittee's reaction was to render a report saying, well, it can be enforced against private charitable, eleemosynary institutions if they don't comply with the '38 exemption, but didn't say anything about applying the Act to governmental purchases where they compete.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.124" offset="12966033">It's a situation where, to take the words of prior Court opinions, there has been public controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.152" offset="12994141">The controversy has been brought to the attention of the Congress, and Congress has not acted, and that is persuasive evidence, in light of all the facts that we have, under traditional criteria applied by the Court, that the Act was not intended to apply in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.738" offset="13064462">And taking all that into account, and combining it with the statement by Mr. Teagarden that as a matter of statutory construction Congress can be assured that the Act will not apply to governmental purchases, and that these government bodies can continue, as the Congressman expressed concern about, to have competitive bidding and to purchase at cheapest prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.180" offset="13182222">That's what Congress was concerned about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.632" offset="13192044">Mr. Teagarden said, don't worry about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.645" offset="13200090">If you leave out the government, then they are not covered, and the issue is not whether this was correct statutory interpretation or not, as the Court recently pointed out in the Merrill Lynch and the Brown case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.596" offset="13251917">The question is, how did Congress perceive this, not whether or not the statutory construction was correct, although I think that there is support which we cite and discuss in our brief for the point that this statutory construction is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.117" offset="13317955">I should point out also that in... there have been... in two of the cases, one the Saks case, that dealt with sales to government liquor stores, and the General Shale case dealt with construction, these are both situations where the government did not compete, and this was an alternative ground of holding, but one ground of holding was that the Robinson-Patman Act did not mean to cover government sales in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.403" offset="13443133">I would like to also point out in answer to the question which was asked earlier of the Petitioner that hospitals doing the dispensing of pharmaceuticals and the giving of public health care is a traditional governmental function.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.521" offset="13531636">The district court here so found, and the Court in National League of Cities so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.392" offset="13559117">There are just two brief points that I want to make quickly that are discussed in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.312" offset="13574791">One is that the state has argued in its brief, and I am going to mention the point, that in order to avoid significant questions under the Tenth Amendment, that the Court should construe the statute so as not to apply to governmental purchases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.665" offset="13640201">The other is that in view of the almost universally recognized inapplicability of the statute to governmental purchases for 46 years, if the Court should, and I don't think there is basis, but if the Court should decide this issue of first impression, then there should not be a retroactive application which would upset not only the states' allocations, cost computations, how they determine what programs to have, what prices are going to be charged, but also have a lot of treble damage liability in cases both against states and against the... sorry, strike states, buffer against the manufacturers of drugs in this particular case, but the manufacturers of every single product, every single commodity which are sold to state and governmental agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.015" offset="13889514">And I emphasize again in conclusion that this is not a case which is limited to drugs or hospitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.715" offset="13916368">This is a very, very far-reaching case which would go to the very heart of everything that states buy, and all the cost allocations which states have made, all the programs which they have in place which are based upon the prices which they have been able to get at lower than trade levels because of the inapplicability of the Robinson-Patman Act.</text>
