            <text syncTime="7.070" offset="158258">Mr. Sloman, I think you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="marvin_s_sloman" startTime="73.046" stopTime="645.351">
            <label>Mr. Marvin S. Sloman</label>
            <text syncTime="73.046" offset="422199">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="76.548" offset="436201">This case involves a state property tax on the shares of state and national banks, authorized by Texas statute but imposed and calculated by local taxing authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.562" offset="508195">In the case before the Court the banks have paid the taxes as agents for the shareholders and they and the shareholders seek to have the tax assessment declared to be in violation of Revised Statutes Section 3701 as amended in 1959 to prohibit every form of taxation that considers United States obligations in the computation of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.997" offset="634000">The Respondents calculated the taxable value of the shares of each bank according to the bank's net worth.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.205" offset="674856">That is, as the court below put it at Appendix page 183, by taking the total assets of the bank other than real estate, which is taxed separately to the bank itself, and deducting the bank's liabilities, to come up with a net worth or equity capital or a number of names as it's known on call statements, financial statements or the taxing authorities, but in an accounting sense it is the net worth, the assets less the liabilities other than real estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.930" offset="829710">Now, among those assets were various amounts of United States obligations that went into that net worth that was used to determine the taxable value of the shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.721" offset="880910">Petitioners contend that Respondents thereby 3701.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.183" offset="946738">Thus, at the center of the case is the effect of the word "considered" as used in that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.020" offset="978085">The word is given no special definition in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.324" offset="999297">Now, of course the word "consider" can be used in two senses: One, which is the sense relied on by Respondents, and they repeatedly refer to the state of mind of the tax assessors, refers to a subjective state or a mental process inside the mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.241" offset="1102950">"In my considered judgment" or</text>
            <text syncTime="247.260" offset="1119042">"This Court considers a case for decision. "</text>
            <text syncTime="251.997" offset="1137955">But that sense of the word cannot be involved here because the word as used in the statute is addressed to and defines a prohibited form of taxation, which is incapable of a mental process.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.910" offset="1217680">Another sense of the word "considers" deals with an objective state of facts, which the statute itself purports to do, as reflected in the dictionary definition of "to take into account".</text>
            <text syncTime="289.955" offset="1289778">The general law of relativity considers the effect of gravity on light or takes into account the effect of gravity.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.513" offset="1336067">This is the meaning that makes sense in the context of Section 3701, so that, substituting the dictionary objective meaning, the statute prohibits every form of taxation that takes into account United States obligations in the computation of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.795" offset="1433138">And this is the sense in which this Court and the Texas courts and other authorities have described the computation of a share tax measured by net assets that included United States obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.674" offset="1500639">For example, in Des Moines National Bank against Fairweather, cited in our brief, this Court was dealing with a share tax that was computed just exactly like the one at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.533" offset="1560093">That is, assets, which included United States obligations, less liabilities resulted in a net worth that was the basis, the base for the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.407" offset="1615577">At that time Section 3701 was in the form before the 1959 amendment and only prohibited taxes upon United States obligations and not those which considered United States obligations, and the Court upheld the tax without a deduction for United States obligations on the familiar distinction that a tax upon a shareholder's interest is not a tax upon the corporation or the corporation's assets, even though, as this Court said in describing the tax there, "controlling consideration" is given to those assets in the computation of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.924" offset="1817661">The Court in its holding said Section 3701 left no authority for taxing a United States obligation to the bank, to the bank itself,</text>
            <text syncTime="438.301" offset="1883176">"but only for taking it into account in valuing the shares of the stockholders. "</text>
            <text syncTime="448.793" offset="1925181">So that this Court in its description of this very kind of tax recognized that the tax considers United States obligations, takes them into account, but under the former form of the statute that was permissible because the tax was only upon United States obligations, whereas since the 1959 amendment taxes are prohibited, every form of tax that considers those obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.834" offset="2081288">We cite in our brief at page 14 Texas authorities that have used similar language and a similar approach in describing the very share tax that's before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.678" offset="2148684">The assessment in the present cases take into account the bank's assets which include United States obligations and therefore come squarely under the statutory prohibition against considering United States obligations in the computation of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.972" offset="2229873">Respondents, however, would read an implied exception into the prohibition of the statute in spite of its apparent application.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.380" offset="2275535">But any implied exceptions are foreclosed by two specific exemptions that the 1959 amendment itself provided from its expanded prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.540" offset="2328198">Under the pre-1959 version of Section 3701, when only taxes upon United States obligations were prohibited, this Court had upheld share taxes, as in Des Moines against Fairweather and other cases, and it had upheld franchise taxes, and it had upheld death taxes or succession taxes, where the tax was measured by assets that included United States obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.594" offset="2456407">And in each of those cases, which are cited in our brief and which cross-refer to one another... the francise tax case refers to the share tax case, and so forth... in each of those cases the tax was upheld because it was not upon United States obligations by which the tax was measured, but rather upon the shareholders' interest or the franchise or the death transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.101" offset="2598408">Now, when Section 3701 was amended by Congress in 1959 into its present form, on which Petitioners rely and which is before this Court, Congress specifically excepted franchise taxes and specifically excepted death taxes from the expanded prohibition of the tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="652.524" offset="2740097">Do we have one rule for estate taxes and another rule for gift taxes, even though they, in the old days anyway, used to be inter-related?</text>

            <label>Mr. Marvin S. Sloman</label>
            <text syncTime="660.278" offset="2771130">Certainly in the view of the Solicitor General that's so.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.182" offset="2790774">No gifts are involved in the case before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.950" offset="2805821">But it would appear that, not being excepted from the statute, that they would be covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.937" offset="2829749">Now, having made no exception for any kind of property tax, share taxes or otherwise, but having excepted franchise taxes and death taxes, it would be quite unwarranted to infer an exception or imply an exception, as Respondents would do, for share taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.123" offset="2950435">Respondents' several arguments end with Section 3701 having no substantive effect, at least as to banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.829" offset="2985334">But the meaning of the statute is plain and its prohibition is clear, irrespective of who owns the exempt obligations.</text>

          <turn speaker="ernest_j_brown" startTime="737.594" stopTime="985.102">
            <label>Mr. Ernest J. Brown</label>
            <text syncTime="737.594" offset="3080420">Mr. Chief Justice and it it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="740.444" offset="3091809">I should like, on behalf of the United States, to refer the Court particularly to the circumstances, the background leading to the 1959 amendment, which is of course central here.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.704" offset="3160773">I think that in light of those circumstances one can conclude, in the terms used just two months ago in the Memphis Bank opinion, that it can be determined that this statute is another manifestation of what the Court called the long-established Congressional intent to prevent taxes which diminish in the slightest degree the market value or the investment attractiveness of obligations of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.293" offset="3295146">The legislation resulted from a presidential message, supported by an appearance of the Secretary of the Treasury, before the Ways and Means Committee, seeking what both called assistance in the management of the national debt, assistance by lifting the debt ceiling, by raising the interest ceiling, or I should say removing the interest ceiling, which was then 3.26 percent on savings bonds and... the figure seems strange to us today... 4.25 percent on obligations of a maturity of more than five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.006" offset="3478004">The Secretary told the Committee that the Treasury was unable to market 4.25 percent bonds and so was necessarily financing the Government on very short-term obligations and Treasury bills.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.319" offset="3555222">Also asked was what both the President and the Secretary referred to as other technical assistance, and that of course is what is referred to here in the exemption, or the further exemption or to clarify the exemption, of national obligations, Government bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.649" offset="3640590">The Congress did lift the debt ceiling.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.402" offset="3663577">It did increase the savings bond ceiling.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.688" offset="3684789">But it did not, after extended discussion of interest rates, whether they were inflationary or not... some of them have echoes even today, of whether higher interest causes inflation or inflation causes higher interest... but it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.233" offset="3754902">So it was the more important that the impact of state taxes on the federal bonds be carefully observed.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.874" offset="3797533">Both the President and the Secretary informed the Congress that the state obligations had a very highly preferential position.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.081" offset="3846330">Federal taxes were high then, as some think them now, and the state exemption made them very attractive, highly marketable.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.139" offset="3894500">As a matter of fact, the Secretary informed the Committee that state obligations in the 12 postwar years had increased from $16 billion to $59 billion, which led to strenuous competition for the federal obligations in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.303" offset="3971195">The Secretary used as an illustration to the Committee an Idaho tax which was in force seeking to reach interest on Government bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.812" offset="4033262">The justification was the tax was on the individual, measured by the interest on the bonds.</text>

            <text syncTime="1062.085" offset="4378288">But I would like to point out that I think what's central here is not the insulation, but the use of the "or measured by" device, which has been frequently used in taxes, sometimes with unpredictable results.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.082" offset="4458327">Justice Harlan... the Idaho case was used as an example, but perhaps a better example would have been the case decided by this Court just four years before, the Cleveland case, Society for Savings, where the tax on financial institutions was on their capital and surplus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.162" offset="4542650">But the Ohio court said, though this was a mutual savings bank, that the tax was on the interest of the depositors, measured by the assets of the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.505" offset="4596044">This Court did not agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.389" offset="4603568">Justice Harlan pointed out that at times it was very hard to distinguish for practical purposes, Justice Stevens, the difference between a tax on the assets and a tax on the shares when the tax on the shares was "computed by".</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.752" offset="4677024">So this "measured by" device which didn't succeed there sometimes does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.287" offset="4699176">It's hard to predict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.922" offset="4705654">I might mention that just six months before this statute this Court held that a Virginia tax on the assets, what purported to be a property tax, could be measured by gross receipts, though Justice Brennan pointed out in a separate opinion that if it were measured by the property it would come to $7,000; on gross receipts it came to $126,000.</text>

            <text syncTime="1195.521" offset="4912126">Yes, I feel that's clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.088" offset="4918395">Some people thought maybe the earlier statement was more universal than its application warranted, and they may have referred to clarification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.126" offset="4958519">But that would hardly be justified when you looked at the decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.430" offset="4979731">So this statute then, I take it, eliminates any computation, and in my view the word "computation" is the operative word here, which takes into account, reaches directly or indirectly the bonds of the Federal Government or the income from those bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.248" offset="5086937">And it is clear that in this case the computation, as in the Georgia case which is pending, did include those bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.103" offset="5122359">I would like to turn briefly, if I may, also to one other federal statute much relied on below, Rev.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.209" offset="5158826">Stat. 5219, a later version, which is relied on as saying there could be taxes on these shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.065" offset="5194248">Well, no one disputes that the shares could be taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.200" offset="5210758">This Court said so in McCulloch and Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.635" offset="5224550">The National Bank Act said nothing in this statute shall prohibit it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.920" offset="5245657">What is objected to here is the method, and certainly that is subject to objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.109" offset="5274392">If I may take the Memphis case, in this context suppose this property tax had included the federal bonds but excluded the state bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.683" offset="5324756">I take it that the share tax would have been as discriminatory there on the property, on the share, as it was held, a somewhat different tax, was held to be discriminatory two months ago in the Memphis case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.010" offset="5378046">So I think that 5219 has no bearing on this case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.962" offset="5397795">It is certainly not carte blanche to tax the shares of a bank or any other corporation which is equally involved in this case, may be equally involved in this case, in any fashion that is desired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.839" offset="5461324">So it seems to me that it's quite clear, and the background in Congress makes it clear, that this statute meant to eliminate computation of estate tax, any form of tax, which directly or indirectly used the value or the income from Government obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.872" offset="5561530">And that's all this case is.</text>

            <text syncTime="1370.846" offset="5613357">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.547" offset="5624224">The National Banking Act of 1864 authorized the tax in question, and that point was litigated in 1866 very thoroughly in Van Ness versus The Assessors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.859" offset="5697471">Van Ness points out that there were two bases for the application of the tax, two prongs for it:</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.163" offset="5726624">Number one, Congress said that you could tax the shares of national banks; and number two, there was no limitation to exclude any part of the value of the shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.089" offset="5786392">And Van Ness versus The Assessors, 1866, held that, number one, you could tax the shares of national banks; and number two, you did not have to deduct the value of the federal obligations owned by the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.384" offset="5851489">This situation remained throughout the years and every case which came to this Court prior to '59 upheld the true share tax, but did not uphold the taxes where they tried to levy on the bank itself rather than the shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.432" offset="5955770">That problem does not exist with the Texas statute, as it clearly levies the tax on the shareholders, and there is no legal obligation upon the bank to pay any part of the share tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="1482.650" offset="6060573">The point I'm trying to draw is that in 1959 for 95 years... for 93 years it had been settled law that national banks and state banks could be taxed on their shares, and that it was not necessary to deduct the value of federal obligations, because under the Van Ness holding when Congress authorized the taxing of the shares it authorized the taxing of the full value of the shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.727" offset="6220861">And that position existed in 1959 and, we respectfully submit, was not changed at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="1552.226" offset="6338934">It was not touched by Congress in any manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.447" offset="6351786">It's our position that the modification or the codification of the exemption statute, 3701, did not in any way apply to or control or reflect upon the taxation of the national bank shares.</text>

            <text syncTime="1908.426" offset="7763653">That has now been changed in 1969 and remedied... or, I shouldn't say remedied, but expanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.516" offset="7796044">When we come back to the point of the implied repeal which I take it the Petitioners must rest upon, we have a number of statutory construction aids which we refer to in our briefs, consistently I hope, and all of them will point to the fact that there was no intention on the part of the Congress to repeal the authority given in the Bank Act to tax the national banks without deduction of any obligations whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.425" offset="7967721">The question of indirect taxation was prohibited before 1959 and if you will look... and we cite the case of Society of Savings versus Bowers, in which Justice Harlan points out that indirect is prohibited with the exception of the bank stock tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.343" offset="8075346">In 1969, coming again to an argument against an implied repeal, in 1969 Congress amended the bank stock tax and enlarged the... changed the method of taxation and directed the Federal Reserve to carry out a study.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.560" offset="8176283">And during that time in '69 the Federal Reserve carried out a study and that study recognized that the bank share tax without any necessity for deducting federal obligations was, at least in the opinion of the people who made that study, still in full force and effect.</text>

          <turn speaker="earl_luna" startTime="2040.246" stopTime="2632.559">
            <label>Mr. Earl Luna</label>
            <text syncTime="2040.246" offset="8291013">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.246" offset="8298954">This Court recently recognized in the Tennessee case the fact that the statute that we have here today, 31 742, principally restates the constitutional rule that we have had since McCulloch versus Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.814" offset="8401249">And in that Memphis Bank case the Court pointed out very clearly that where the legal incidence of the tax falls on the separate property interest of the stockholder or some other person other than the Government or the owner of the bonds itself, that unless there is a discrimination between the national... the taxation as to the federal securities and others, that it didn't violate 31 U.S.C. 742.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.307" offset="8571254">Now, there is no contention in this case as it is before the Court at this time that there is any discrimination on federal securities versus any other type securities, such as there was in the Tennessee case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.935" offset="8641785">Now, if that is true, the constitutional provision... that statutory provision, as late as the Memphis case the Court has said it does not affect this kind of a transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.682" offset="8728720">Now, I think that takes us, if we go all the way back to the two questions or the two reasons that were raised actually in the Van Allen case, the court in Texas, our Chief Justice Guittard, I think pointed out very carefully that there were two grounds that were mentioned in the Van Allen case, either one of which were sufficient to sustain our tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.551" offset="8852227">Now, the court pointed out first that there was a distinction between taxation of the shares and taxation of bank assets, and I think that is this insulation that we were talking about earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.079" offset="8918265">There is an insulation between the corporation's assets and the stockholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.650" offset="8944596">The legal incidence is on the stockholder and not the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.304" offset="8967166">The second reason that was mentioned in the Van Allen case which made it permissible to tax bank shares was a Congressional consent to state taxation of bank shares as expressed in Section 5219.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.967" offset="9049817">5219 has never been altered or changed, although it was expanded ten years after the '59 amendment that didn't allow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.775" offset="9097047">In 1969 the Congress expanded that amendment to include more general areas than it did before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.415" offset="9147620">But in our case, if then we take a look at the question we were talking about a while ago, the taxation of federal securities, I think if the tax the legal incident of which falls on these federal securities, it doesn't make any difference who it is, we cannot tax them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.781" offset="9241138">That's been very clear, and the cases have pointed out that we can't do it directly or indirectly, and they said that before 31 U.S.C. 742 was amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.987" offset="9281994">All of these cases have said that they can't be taxed directly or indirectly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.724" offset="9304877">But at the same time that the courts were saying they can't be taxed directly or indirectly, the court also said that a tax on the stockholder is not a tax on a bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.800" offset="9357226">Now, at some stages of this litigation the banks have said, but we paid the tax actually, and of course the reason they did that is because of another federal statute that permits them to pay the tax for the stockholder and that the bank can deduct it if the stockholder doesn't deduct it himself, which really makes it not material at all to the questions that we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.048" offset="9438206">Now, we believe then that if we were to follow the view that the banks have propounded here today, that it would indeed mean that any corporation which owns federal securities, you would have to subtract that stock or those bonds and federal securities from the value of the stock before you could tax it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.352" offset="9571430">As a matter of fact, in one of the footnotes in our brief we point out that there are about 20-something states who tax either corporate stock in corporations generally or bank stock or both.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.278" offset="9627124">Now, in Texas that question is not material because we do not tax the corporate stock in other types of corporations, only banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.550" offset="9668188">But as this Court mentioned in one of its opinions, if that should be... if we should have to deduct it in all cases, it would be nothing but chaos in the taxing systems of the various states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.678" offset="9740704">Now, there is nothing in 31 U.S.C. 742 as amended in 1959 to require or suggest that it applies to ad valorem taxation if we can rely to any extent on the Congressional history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.710" offset="9844880">Secretary Anderson introduced Section 105 of that bill and in his introduction to the Ways and Means Committee of the bill he pointed out very carefully that indeed Idaho had attempted to tax the income from federal securities and they had not been able to convince them it wasn't taxable and Idaho was including it in the net income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.193" offset="9958774">And he pointed out in his statement, which we quote at length in our brief, that it was... that they believed that Idaho was wrong, but that this seemed to be the easiest way to clarify the problem, and therefore he recommended that Congress pass 105, Section 105 of that bill, in order to clarify the situation that they had as to Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.332" offset="10091372">And that was the only thing that we had before the Congress at that time insofar as reasons as to why that statute ought to be amended in that particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.543" offset="10152185">Now, the Petitioners say that we shouldn't take into consideration in thinking about statutes anything subjective, that it's all objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.220" offset="10214879">Now, unless we look at it subjective we don't get to the question here, because our state statute simply says that the value of stock, the bank stock, shall be assessed at its cash value less the value of the real estate which may be taxed separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.149" offset="10302546">So our statute just talks about cash value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.418" offset="10315711">It doesn't say anything about the things we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.220" offset="10326892">Now, as a measuring stick of cash value we might use several things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.893" offset="10357612">In the Bank of Texas case where this decision was written, had we used cash value that they were getting when they were selling the stock down at the bank, the testimony showed it was bringing nine dollars a share.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.034" offset="10410170">And the measuring stick that we used was $5.65 a share.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.972" offset="10441830">So they're really arguing about our formula, not that we taxed the bank too high, the stock too high.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.328" offset="10475267">So they say, if they use our formula, which was based on equity capital and not on what it was selling for at the marketplace, they wound up paying less tax than they would otherwise have paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.492" offset="10555933">Are they injured?</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.861" offset="10565442">Is there harm?</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.678" offset="10572756">And when one is challenging a statute, doesn't he have the burden of proving that there has been some harm?</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.049" offset="10606193">Certainly that has not been shown in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.703" offset="10624792">The only thing that has been shown is that by using the formula with which they argue the banks got a windfall.</text>

            <text syncTime="2674.720" offset="10828861">--I don't believe it had one iota on Van Allen, because I cannot believe that in all of the hearings of Congress they would have overruled almost 100 years of cases of this Court and never told anybody that's what they were doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.080" offset="10894271">That's just not the way Congress ordinarily works.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.098" offset="10906392">And they said that, instead of talking about the decisions of this Court, while the Congressional history was going on they said that, we're doing it in order to clarify the problem that we've got up in Idaho, and that is the only thing that there is in the Congressional history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.761" offset="10980998">And it would be indeed unusual if Congress were to overrule that many cases of this Court and not a word ever be said about what was going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.855" offset="11041393">In Plummer versus Coler the Court, this Court, had also pointed out in inheritance tax cases that there really was no impact on the market in the first place, on the market of bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.105" offset="11154451">I mention that very quickly because of one of the arguments that was made by, I believe it was the Solicitor General, that there was an impact on the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.461" offset="11187888">Now here the non-banking world owned 77 percent of all of these, of all of United States securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.918" offset="11229684">Of the 23 percent that is owned by the banks, there's only about five percent of the total that is owned by the banks in the six states or seven states that tax bank shares, six now since Georgia just recently repealed theirs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.451" offset="11327799">And the only case, of course, that they have in their favor is the Montana case, and the Montana case... and as they argue here, this permits bank share case... it prohibits the bank share taxation, but permits the franchise tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.066" offset="11422258">And of course as we know, Montana just recently ruled that their franchise tax is unconstitutional, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.570" offset="11444306">We believe that, as the Texas court held, the Montana case is not reliable, and 732 was something that was aimed at the Idaho income tax, that it has absolutely no effect on the tax that's before the Court at this time.</text>

            <text syncTime="3114.704" offset="12588782">At the time the 1979 cases were first before the Texas Court of Civil Appeals, the Court of Civil Appeals entered its first opinion, in which it resolved every single state law question that was involved in these cases, including a question as to injury which was specifically raised by Dallas County in that case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3149.611" offset="12728485">But I am saying that this Court in the 1979 case has no state law questions concerning injury or anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.983" offset="12765893">And in the 1980 case there was a judgment entered in favor of the Petitioners here, which was then vacated and a new judgment entered based on the reversal of the judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals in the 1979 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.094" offset="12838408">But at one point in all of these cases all state law questions have been resolved and they're not present in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.284" offset="12871114">The Court is I think very clearly presented with a pure question of what the word 3701.</text>
