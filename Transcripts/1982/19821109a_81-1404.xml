            <text syncTime="74.502" offset="433714">These cases were brought pursuant to Title 42 of the United States Code, Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.780" offset="470808">The precise issue that is being presented to this Court for decision is whether a police officer who commits perjury during a state court criminal trial should be granted absolute immunity from civil liability under Title 42, United States Code, Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.632" offset="546145">It is the contention of the Petitioners that such absolute immunity should not be extended to police officers who have perjured themselves during state court criminal trials, and that there are four fundamental reasons why such absolute immunity should not be extended to police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.124" offset="628169">The first of these reasons is that qualified good faith immunity as opposed to absolute immunity has generally been observed by this Court to be the predominant standard in civil rights actions where immunity questions are raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.415" offset="685325">The Court has recognized that qualified good faith immunity gives an opportunity to a civil rights defendant to defend the case, but at the same time, gives the civil rights plaintiff an opportunity to attempt to make a case out of a violation of his constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.080" offset="755960">The Court has recognize that the qualified good faith immunity does apply to police officers.</text>

            <text syncTime="448.152" offset="1928231">That's true, but there are two observations that are critical to this case that relates to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.399" offset="1953205">First of all, the Court has held that Congress did not intend to nullify an immunity if the legislative history of the 1871 Civil Rights Act were silent on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.160" offset="2004300">The Petitioners have taken the position that the 42nd Congress was not silent on the point of whether it considered perjury an act that should be condemned and should be actionable under the 1871 Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.936" offset="2059366">Indeed, there are many comments throughout the legislative history to the effect that perjury was to be condemned, and that it indeed would be actionable under Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.633" offset="2114223">Furthermore, with respect to the question of immunities not being automatically eliminated as a result of the passage of the act, the Court's recent pronouncements have indicated clearly that a simple recognition of the fact that a common law immunity existed does not end the inquiry, but that the Court will consider the history of the particular immunity suggested and determine under modern day policy reasons whether that immunity should apply equally in the civil rights context as it would in the common law context, as it has been previous to the passage of the 1871 Civil Rights Act.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edmund B. Moran, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="548.190" offset="2328427">I would think that the most significant reason why there should be a special rule underlies the passage of the 1871 Civil Rights Act, which was, I would suggest, the policy of Congress finding that in creating a new tort under Section 1983, there was in effect a much more serious aspect to that kind of a tort, and that the aspect that was so serious was that the tort was rendered by a governmental agent who was found to have had power that could not be wielded by the average person who might consider a common, or might perpetrate a common law tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.781" offset="2506791">In that particular instance, the Congress showed that it wanted to provide a damages remedy to a victim of governmental overreaching.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.168" offset="2540333">In the decision of this Court in Monroe v. Pape, there was an explicit recognition by Justice Harlan to the effect that Section 1983 was significant in its effort to recognize that a constitutional tort was more significant than a common law tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.300" offset="2632806">There Justice Harlan said,</text>
            <text syncTime="626.268" offset="2640747">"The statute becomes more than a. "</text>
            <text syncTime="628.126" offset="2648166">judicial...</text>
            <text syncTime="628.595" offset="2650047">"jurisdictional provision only if one attributes to the enacting legislature the view that a deprivation of a constitutional right is significantly different from and more serious than a violation of a state right and therefore deserves a different remedy even though the same act may constitute both a state tort and a deprivation of a constitutional act. "</text>
            <text syncTime="650.960" offset="2739490">"This view, by no means unrealistic as a common-sense matter is, I believe, more consistent with the flavor of the legislative history than is a view that the primary purpose of the statute was to grant a lower court forum for fact findings.

            <text syncTime="664.175" offset="2792362">I think it's clear that the reason that there can be and should be a special exception in this area relates to the fact that the 42nd Congress considered a tort committed by a governmental agent to be, indeed, a very serious situation that should be actionable even though it might not have been actionable under common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.868" offset="2883164">The question of immunities that have been raised in the context of constitutional or civil rights litigation has been addressed several times by the Court in the last seven to eight years.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.093" offset="2983996">In doing so, the Court seems to have taken the direction that absolute immunity will be considered to be the exception to the rule, and that qualified good faith immunity would be the predominant standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.055" offset="3031853">In Butz v. Economou, the Court was asked to decide the specific question of whether a civil rights plaintiff could sue a cabinet-level officer for an alleged defamation.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.879" offset="3087128">He brought the action under a Bivens type action and asserted that he should be allowed to bring an action against the Secretary of Agriculture.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.093" offset="3127983">The Secretary of the Agriculture brought to this Court's attention two prior decisions rendered by it, Spalding v. Vilas and Barr v. Matteo.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.137" offset="3172182">Both of those actions were essentially common law defamation actions which eventually resulted in decisions by this Court to the effect that the defendants in those cases were absolutely immune from damages in a common law action.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.536" offset="3229756">When this Court was asked to extend the holding in Barr and Spalding to the constitutional tort context in Butz v. Economou, the Court refused to do that and specifically indicated that if there was a common law immunity for the common law action of defamation, that immunity would not be extended to the Secretary of Agriculture in the constitutional tort context, and the Court upheld the right of the plaintiff to bring that action.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.351" offset="3353054">Thus, we have seen that there was specifically a contraction of immunities that were observed in common law but were considered... but that the Court considered it necessary to contract the scope of those immunities in the constitutional tort context.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.485" offset="3421600">The Court has extended absolute immunity that was found in common law, in many instances in ages-old common law immunity situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.933" offset="3471441">It has extended it to judges in Pierson v. Ray, to administrative law judges in Butz v. Economou, to prosecutors in Imbler v. Pachtman, to legislators in Tenney v. Brandhove, and to the President in Nixon v. Fitzgerald.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.051" offset="3539882">However, the common thread through all of those decisions has been that if absolute immunity were not extended to the people who performed the functions attendant to those offices, indeed, the very functioning of the government insofar as it was embodied in the activities inherent in those offices, might be paralyzed, the basic idea being that if a person were deterred from going ahead and making significant decisions through intimidation or harassment that might be attendant to a possible lawsuit brought against them for conducting those activities that an immunity, an absolute immunity should attach to those activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.189" offset="3716365">It has been the Petitioners' contention throughout this lawsuit that there is no decisionmaking involved in testifying in a judicial proceeding, and that there, in fact, is no discretion in any material sense involved in testifying in that a witness is required to testify completely and truthfully to questions that are put to him during the judicial proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="959.477" offset="3973515">But the Court has continued to recognize that even though there is, in essence, a down side to allowing civil rights plaintiffs to bring civil rights lawsuits against governmental agents, even in recognition of a detraction, so to speak, from the performance of their normal duties will be allowed so that the purposes behind Section 1983 will be advanced, and that a person who is a victim of constitutional violations can gain compensation for that act.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.134" offset="4112173">And indeed, in the case of police officers, which is being presented to this Court now, in both Monroe v. Pape and Pierson v. Ray, the Court said that police officers would be held to only be qualifiably immune from civil rights actions for nearly everything that they had to do during the course of their duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.796" offset="4206840">It would be the Petitioners' contention that testifying by police officers is simply another one of their duties and that, indeed, although they might be interrupted from their duties and might be forced to come to court and defend their actions in such a lawsuit, this would be just considered the cost of going ahead and allowing a civil rights plaintiff to bring a proper 1983 action.</text>

            <text syncTime="2123.927" offset="8631356">Certainly this Court has discussed some common law immunities it has not adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.049" offset="8655807">Witnesses, like judges and prosecutor, were granted absolute civil immunity at common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.795" offset="8686840">For example, in 1772, Lord Mansfield stated the proposition that neither party, witness, counsel, jury or judge shall be put to answer civilly or criminally for words spoken in office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.196" offset="8744414">Most American courts have adopted the English rule of absolute witness immunity, tempered with the requirement that the witness' statements be pertinent and relevant to the court's inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.412" offset="8789345">In addition, this position was also taken by Professor Prosser and by the restatement of torts, and this Court similarly noted in Imbler v. Pachtman that witnesses are absolutely privileged for words spoken during the course of a judicial proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.826" offset="8850994">Public policy requires that all witnesses, including police officers, be granted absolute civil immunity for their testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.432" offset="8885371">The primary reason for granting witnesses absolute civil immunity is the concern that witnesses will be intimidated and harassed and will not speak freely if their testimony may become the subject of future civil litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.912" offset="8939288">In addition, the courts may become a forum for vexacious and repetitive litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2260.933" offset="9179405">--Well, Your Honor, I believe Congress was concerned about many things when it enacted the Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.182" offset="9200408">However, of course, perjury was one of them, but we do not believe that Congress ever intended to abolish the common law, absolute witness immunity that to some extent has been carried on by this Court and through other courts in its language consistently.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.097" offset="9268013">Petitioners argue that police officers are entitled to only a qualified immunity for their testimony pursuant to this Court's ruling in Pierson v. Ray.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.545" offset="9313884">We submit that this argument is misguided and must fail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.996" offset="9327676">First, it must be noted that Pierson only discussed the qualified immunity granted to police officers when acting as arresting officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.727" offset="9362576">This Court's decision in Pierson was based upon the common law history of immunity granted to arresting officers when they act reasonably.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.318" offset="9396953">Therefore, Petitioners' argument ignores the functional analysis that this Court has applied in its immunity decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.925" offset="9427360">It is the function of a 1983 defendant, rather than his official title, that will determine whether he is to be granted absolute civil immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.359" offset="9461110">Thus, pursuant to this Court's decision in Pierson, a police officer, when functioning as an arresting officer, is entitled to a qualified immunity, and we would assert that a police officer, when functioning as a witness, is entitled to absolute civil immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.195" offset="9528401">This Court has previously noted that 1983 defendants may be granted various degrees of immunity, depending upon the specific function performed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.036" offset="9567794">For example, a prosecutor, when functioning as an advocate for the government, has been granted absolute immunity pursuant to this Court's decision in Imbler.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.375" offset="9605201">However, this Court has also noted that prosecutors may be granted only a qualified immunity when functioning as administrators or as investigative officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.964" offset="9643549">There are also special policy considerations that compel this Court to grant all witnesses, including police officers, absolute civil immunity for their testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.584" offset="9689942">Initially, it must be noted that if police officer witnesses are not granted absolute civil immunity, that the result will be a retrenchment from the functional analysis that this Court has applied in its previous immunity decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.221" offset="9744591">As we have stated previously, it is the function of the 1983 defendant rather than his official title, that will determine whether he is to be granted absolute civil immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.387" offset="9785237">Thus, in the case of the police officer who testifies, he acts as a witness because in a courtroom he is treated like any other witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.962" offset="9819510">In addition, if police officers are not granted absolute civil immunity for their testimony, there will be a virtual retrial of the criminal offense in a new forum, even though post-trial relief is available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.005" offset="9875725">Such suits could be expected with great frequency, for a defendant will often transform his resentment at being prosecuted into a claim that the police officer had submitted perjured testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.750" offset="9918671">In addition, if police officers are not granted absolute civil immunity, they may become the only witnesses not granted absolute witness immunity, and of course, the American courts have never created distinctions between witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.337" offset="9976976">In the alternative, if police officers are granted only a qualified immunity for their testimony, the result may be an extension of this qualified immunity to other government witnesses, such as medical examiners, court-appointed psychiatrists or county surveyors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.877" offset="10043118">In any event, as Judge Wilke observed in his dissenting opinion in Briggs v. Goodwin, if the principal of absolute witness immunity is rejected, a patchquilt of underlying immunities varying from witness to witness and subject matter to subject matter will result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.419" offset="10109365">Further, a ruling that police officers are entitled to only a qualified immunity would stand in a way to ignore the special features of the judicial system, which include the administration of an oath, the availability of cross examination and impeachment, the potential for criminal penalties for perjury and post-trial relief, and the responsibility of a trial judge to exclude inadmissible and inflammatory testimony.</text>

            <text syncTime="2554.596" offset="10354080">We respectfully submit that Petitioners' argument creates artificial and irrelevant distinctions between police officer witnesses and all other witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.092" offset="10392009">For example, Petitioners argue that police officers testify regularly, thereby eliminating the concern that a police officer may be intimidated or harassed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.869" offset="10431089">However, it is the fear that a witness' testimony may become the subject of future civil litigation that creates this intimidation or harassment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.616" offset="10466093">In addition, many other witnesses, such as court-appointed psychiatrists or medical examiners, also testify regularly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.050" offset="10495872">Petitioners also argue that police officers testify with a badge of authority, creating a likelihood that they will be believed, even if they present testimony that is neither true nor credible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.139" offset="10548222">However, many other witnesses, such as physicians or psychologists, also testify with a badge of authority because they have received many graduate degrees or are recognized as experts in their field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.322" offset="10592943">Of course, it is the responsibility of the trier of fact to sift through conflicting testimony in order to resolve the dispute based in part upon the credibility of the witnesses, regardless of whether the witness is a government witness or has received many graduate degrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.877" offset="10659190">Petitioners also argue that a qualified immunity will not place an undue burden upon the police officer witness because he is already accustomed to civil rights liability in his other functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.748" offset="10706628">Of course, this argument ignores the functional analysis that we discussed previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.715" offset="10726481">In addition, Petitioners argue that civil rights claims may be disposed of quickly through the use of motions to dismiss or for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.571" offset="10761903">However, where the good faith or reasonableness of a witness is in question, a trial will probably be necessary in order to resolve the dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.239" offset="10792623">In addition, a qualified immunity could create civil rights liability for other witnesses allegedly jointly engaged with the police in the presentation of perjured testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.656" offset="10838285">We would also like to note that the thrust of Petitioners' argument is that absolute immunity will be used as a cloak behind which the clever and deceptive witness will hide, enabling him to lie without fear of civil liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.198" offset="10900457">However, we must assume that the vast majority of all police officers testify honestly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.412" offset="10929296">The average, honest police officer must be granted the same absolute civil immunity granted to every other witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.285" offset="10960747">As Judge Learned Hand observed in Gregor v. Biddle, if it were possible in practice to confine such complaints to the guilty, it would be monstrous to deny recovery, because it is not possible to confine such complaints to the guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.482" offset="11021560">Public policy and the effective functioning of our judicial system compels that police officer witnesses be granted absolute civil immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.415" offset="11057296">In conclusion, we respectfully request that this Court affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals and grant all witnesses, including police officers, absolute civil immunity from liability pursuant to 42 USC Section 1983.</text>
