            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="92313">The next decision that I have to bring is 81-827, Jefferson County Pharmaceutical Association against the Abbott Laboratories.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.862" offset="143722">The question presented is whether the sale of pharmaceutical products to a State for resale and competition with private retail pharmacies is exempt from the principles of the Robinson-Patman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.432" offset="202027">The petitioner, a trade association of retail pharmacies in Alabama, filed this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.075" offset="232538">Respondent, pharmaceutical manufacturers are alleged to sell their products to the State at prices lower than those charged private pharmacies.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.046" offset="280395">Both the District Court and the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that the state purchases, whether for resale or not, are exempt from the Robinson-Patman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.873" offset="331804">The language of that Act contains no such exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.469" offset="346119">The legislative history is essentially silent on the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.502" offset="366285">The Act is a component of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.581" offset="382586">Our case has repeatedly have held that a strong presumption exist against the implying exemptions for such laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.363" offset="421665">Moreover, a purpose of the Act was to protect small retailers from the ability of larger organizations to obtain discriminatory prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.995" offset="468267">Accordingly, we reverse the decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.253" offset="481224">We make clear, however, that our holding is limited to sales where the product is resold by the State or by a state agency in competition with private retailers.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.559" offset="530543">Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.476" offset="542142">Justice O'Connor also has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Brennan, Rehnquist, and Stevens have joined.</text>
