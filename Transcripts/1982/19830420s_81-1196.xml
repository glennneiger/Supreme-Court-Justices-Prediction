            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="5.666" offset="114856">This case is here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.069" offset="144531">The question presented is whether a plaintiff in a suit brought under 42 United States Code Section 1983 may recover punitive damages as well as compensatory damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.465" offset="214121">The respondent, while an inmate in a Missouri reformatory for youthful first offenders, was harassed, beaten, and sexually assaulted by his cellmates.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.508" offset="262291">And he brought suit under Section 1983 in Federal District Court against the petitioner, a guard at the reformatory, and other officers, alleging that they had violated his Eighth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.137" offset="328746">And the trial judge, charged the jury that it could award punitive damages in addition to actual damages if the petitioner's conduct was shown to be a reckless or callous disregard of, or indifference to, the rights or safety of others.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.278" offset="413383">And the District Court entered judgment on a verdict brought in by the jury finding the petitioner liable and awarding both compensatory and punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.359" offset="461657">The Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.933" offset="472002">And we in turn, affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.592" offset="490601">We hold that punitive damages are available in a proper case under Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.824" offset="523515">While there is little in the legislative history of Section 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 from which Section 1983 is derived concerning the damages recoverable for the tort liability created by the statute, the availability of punitive damages was accepted as settled law by nearly all state and federal courts at the time of enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.863" offset="635737">Moreover, this Court has rested decisions on related issues on the premise that punitive damages are available under Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.331" offset="681608">The next question however is when the jury may award punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.719" offset="703133">And we hold with the lower courts that a jury may be permitted to assess punitive damages in a 1983 action when the defendant's conduct involves reckless or callous indifference to the plaintiff's federally protected rights, as well as when that conduct is motivated by evil motive or intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.265" offset="797279">The common law, both in 1871 and today, allows recovery of punitive damages in tort cases not only for actual malicious intent, but for reckless also -- for reckless indifference to the rights of others.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.383" offset="861749">And neither the policies nor the purposes of Section 1983 require a departure from the common-law rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.913" offset="895917">The petitioner's contention that an actual-intent standard is preferable is just not that persuasive.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.729" offset="927159">Justice Rehnquist has filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice and Justice Powell have joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.696" offset="955058">And Justice O'Connor has also filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
