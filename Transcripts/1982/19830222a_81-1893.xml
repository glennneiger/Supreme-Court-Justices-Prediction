            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="144834">Mr. Mayfield, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.764" offset="167822">And, we are hearing California against Ramos.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harley D. Mayfield</label>
            <text syncTime="9.371" offset="182241">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.292" offset="193944">The Respondent was sentenced to death for first-degree murder during the commission of a robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.651" offset="215365">He robbed the on-duty employees at a fast food restaurant where he worked, after which he shot both of them in the head, and one of them lived.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.223" offset="261654">He was convicted of two counts of robbery, attempted murder, and murder of the first degree, along with a special allegation that the murder was committed during the commission of a robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.344" offset="310137">Under the California Penal Code, murder of the first degree is punishable by 25 years to life, unless certain special circumstances are alleged and found true beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.932" offset="368547">In which case, the alternative penalties are death or life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.177" offset="397490">The penalty is determined at a separate hearing in which the trier of fact is a jury unless waived by both parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.721" offset="435629">At that separate hearing both parties may present additional evidence, and the statute provides for certain specified aggravating and mitigating factors which the jury must consider in addition to an additional catch-all factor permitting the jury to consider any factor in litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.492" offset="534790">If the aggravating circumstances outweigh mitigating circumstances, the jury is required to return a verdict of death.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.455" offset="586617">If mitigating circumstances outweigh aggravating circumstances, the jury is required to return a verdict of life imprisonment without possibility of parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.655" offset="623397">The trial judge may modify a verdict of death to one of life without the possibility of parole; although if the jury returns the lesser punishment, it cannot be increased.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.664" offset="695391">The statute also requires that the trier of fact be instructed that the punishment of life imprisonment without possibility of parole may in the future be modified by the governor to include a lesser sentence which permits the possibility of parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.170" offset="793507">In this case, defense counsel objected to that instruction being given on the ground that it violated his right to due process of law, and the trial judge overruled the objection on the ground it was required by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.849" offset="868217">On automatic appeal to the California Supreme Court, the Court expressly and exclusively reversed the death penalty on the ground that the portion of the statute which required the giving of that instruction violated the defendant's right to due process under the 5th, 8th, and 14th Amendments for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.261" offset="969781">One, that it introduced an extraneous factor into the jury's deliberations.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.587" offset="991097">And, second, that it was misleading because it did not require an instruction, because the instruction did not inform the jury that the governor could also commute a sentence of death to a lesser sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.189" offset="1061523">The issue presented on Certiorari to this Court is whether enforcement of that statutory provision requiring instruction violates the 5th, 8th, and 14th Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.027" offset="1120873">This Court's cases indicate that due process is violated whenever a defendant is deprived of some guaranteed right, or if a procedure is fundamentally unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.878" offset="1204256">In the capital cases which sort of blend the 5th, the 14th, and 8th Amendment principles, cases have held that a procedure which increases the likelihood of an arbitrary, a capricious, or unreliable sentencing determination may violate due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.647" offset="1319404">There is a basic distinction this Court has drawn between capital cases and others on the ground that the death sentence is unique in its finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.423" offset="1366424">A subsidiary question under the question presented on Certiorari, since this is a state statutory procedure, is the question whether the statute clearly and unmistakably violates the defendant's due process rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.695" offset="1459525">In California's alternative sentences, the sentence of death, the meaning is quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.035" offset="1496932">If that sentence is carried out, the defendant will be put to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.550" offset="1515009">On the other hand, the sentence... the alternative sentence of life without possibility of parole is not literally accurate because it does not mean that if that sentence is imposed the defendant must inevitably be perpetually imprisoned... imprisoned until death.</text>

            <text syncTime="387.452" offset="1694627">In California law, a sentence of life imprisonment permits a consideration for parole after seven years.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.291" offset="1741961">The sentence of life imprisonment without possibility of parole for murder was not available in California until 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.567" offset="1803087">Previously, that sentence was only imposed on certain aggravated forms of kidnapping.</text>

            <text syncTime="753.806" offset="3159992">But, it does not specifically refer to the death sentence whereas the second part of the instruction does.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.928" offset="3176501">From the standpoint of the alternatives offered, I believe it is reasonable to consider that the determination by a sentencer will in some way be affected by the sentencer's perception of the alternatives that he is choosing between.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.793" offset="3283916">For example, in Beck v. Alabama where the jury could only return a verdict of guilty of a capital offense, even though there was evidence from which a lesser offense could be returned, this Court found that that would skew the determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.298" offset="3393944">I believe that the determination of the jury's verdict could be skewed also if the jury believed that the difference between the alternative punishments is minimal.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.603" offset="3467192">For instance, it would be impermissible under the California statute for a juror who was convinced that aggravating circumstances outweighed mitigating circumstances to impose a sentence of life imprisonment without possible parole because he believed that was a more severe sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.777" offset="3595923">Probably, not too many people may think that, but I suggest there are some.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.947" offset="3620583">Similarly, it would be impermissible under the California statute for a juror who was convinced that mitigating circumstances outweighed aggravated circumstances to impose the punishment of death, because he thought he was doing the defendant a favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.861" offset="3692263">In this case, the defendant himself, at least, told at least his psychiatrist that he would rather have the death penalty than life without parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.418" offset="3742418">There is a probability that a large percentage... a substantial percentage... of jurors will be aware of California law, and will, in any event, realize that there is a power of commutation of sentences of life without parole... that there is a possibility of parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.985" offset="3852759">But, I think it is reasonable for California to decide that it is preferable if every juror in every case is aware of that by manner of a simple instruction which tells them this fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.415" offset="3934470">When we speak of the liability of sentencing determinations, I think that consistency is of some significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.911" offset="3972400">As to the other part of the California Supreme Court's decision that the instruction is misleading, I believe it is significant that trial counsel below did not make that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.246" offset="4053797">And, I suggest the reason possibly is set forth in the California Supreme Court's decision in People v. Morse, back in 60 Cal 2d, where they said since people probably know something about parole, you should tell the jury that there is a possibility of parole, but tell them that is not supposed to be what they base their decision on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.391" offset="4154316">They should not take that into consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.563" offset="4159018">On the other hand, you should not tell a jury about the power of a trial judge, or the California Supreme Court, or the governor to commute a sentence of death--</text>

            <text syncTime="1723.398" offset="7038339">First, it affirmatively misleads a jury in the penalty phase of a capital case as to the nature of its function and the consequences of its decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1751.089" offset="7149098">It tells a jury, in effect, you have two choices here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1757.915" offset="7176475">But you should bear in mind that life without parole does not mean life without parole, that the governor can commute life without parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.897" offset="7196328">And, I may say in passing in response to the question that Justice Rehnquist asked that the term life without parole is no more a term of art in the state of California than is the term death.</text>

            <text syncTime="3011.211" offset="12189582">The California Supreme Court has reached the issue on the merits in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.163" offset="12205464">There is no issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.179" offset="12209539">Whatever shortcoming of state law and state procedure there may have been in failing to tender this instruction to the jury has been forgiven by the California Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.346" offset="12250186">That is no obstacle to this Court's going on and reaching it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.999" offset="12272756">I ask the Court to bear in mind that the California Supreme Court has stated flat out that if this were... if we were dealing with a provision here which were an installment... a provision of an installment sales contract for the purchase of an automobile, and it were before a municipal court somewhere in the state of California, that that court would be required to strike it down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.145" offset="12389366">This is the equivalent of telling somebody I have two automobiles to sell.</text>

            <text syncTime="3073.529" offset="12438894">And, I suggest, that if it is not good enough for a municipal court in the state of California then it ought not be good enough in a death case before the highest court in the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.042" offset="12484974">The other thing that I guess needs to be mentioned... although I do not think more can be done about it than mention it... is that there is a procedural problem in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.849" offset="12540145">I think there is a serious question about the security of the court's jurisdiction in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.846" offset="12560207">There is a ruling on the merits of a state law issue in this case contained at footnote 22 of the Court's Opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.655" offset="12595420">It is the last issue briefed in our brief on the merits in which the California Supreme Court has ruled flatly that there was an error of state law in this case under California Evidence Code, Section 352, in the admission of certain highly prejudicial error, basically statements of the defendant that he might seek revenge on the jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.927" offset="12684445">But the California Supreme Court has ruled under California evidence law... there is no federal constitutional question there... that this was erroneously admitted.</text>

            <text syncTime="3257.643" offset="13175338">Prejudicial evidence they found admitted included the defendant's psychiatrist's testimony that the defendant himself knew about the possibility of parole and was considering whether he might want to take revenge if he were paroled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.011" offset="13252870">In regard to amplifying instructions, the California Supreme Court did not find and the statute does not provide that a defendant, if he chose to do so, could not request additional amplifying instructions whether they related to a disclaimer telling the jury not to consider the other instruction or an additional instruction about commutation of the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.386" offset="13394349">The citation to Gardner v. Florida, that case is sort of the obverse of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.321" offset="13430085">That involved the instance where the sentencer, the judge, had some information that the defendant and his counsel did not have, and may have based his decision on that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3354.073" offset="13561115">In regard to a necessity for some prophylactic measure to offset this instruction to the jury informing them that there is, in fact, a possibility of parole, I suggest that we have it in the declarements of the statute itself, which sets forth specific factors for the jury to consider and permits them to return a death penalty only if they find aggravating factors outweigh mitigating factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.731" offset="13691727">And, I suggest that this instruction is not about commutation anyway.</text>
