            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="92313">The third case, 81-1181, Lockheed Aircraft against United States comes to us from the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.231" offset="141214">A civilian employee of the United States was killed in the crash of an airforce plane that had been manufactured by petitioner, Lockheed Aircraft Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.468" offset="186145">The Government paid benefits to the survivors under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.729" offset="215193">The state also recovered damages from Lockheed.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.979" offset="232225">Lockheed then sought indemnity from the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.133" offset="260751">The District Court granted summary judgment for Lockheed, but the Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.511" offset="282275">It held that the exclusive-liability provision of the Compensation Act bars all such third-party actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.498" offset="322295">We think the Court of Appeals erred in not following Weyerhaeuser against United States, a case decided by this Court in 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.433" offset="365972">Accordingly, we hold that the Compensation Act does not bar Lockheed's claim to seek indemnity.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.110" offset="392721">The merits of that claim are not before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.270" offset="405364">We reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.007" offset="424277">Justice Rehnquist has filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice joined.</text>
