            <text syncTime="74.704" offset="448088">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case presents some of the questions that we believe were left unresolved by this Court's decision in the Manhart case.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.028" offset="493437">In Manhart, this Court was concerned with a mandatory employer-operated pension fund which required the women make larger contributions than men.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.320" offset="542547">The result was that a woman's take-home pay was smaller than a man's.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.755" offset="568356">This Court held that such a plan violated Title 7, and we make no contention today that such holding was erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.282" offset="602420">But the Arizona Deferred Compensation Plan is different in a number of respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.906" offset="628960">In the Arizona an, independent insurance companies issue the life annuities that are involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.760" offset="672323">They, not Arizona, are the ones who determine the appropriate monthly payment to be made based on the amount accumulated by the employee and the age and the sex of that employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.942" offset="721120">It is the insurance companies which developed and use the sex-based actuarial tables which are in issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.282" offset="758423">Arizona did not create or control or use such tables, but nevertheless has been held responsible for their use.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.403" offset="798861">Arizona's only intent was to make available to its employees participating in its deferred compensation plan the widest possible selection of payout methods, including life annuities.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.397" offset="866883">Arizona did not treat or intend to treat its female employees less favorably than its male employees.</text>

            <label>Mr. John L. Endicott</label>
            <text syncTime="254.351" offset="1166665">It is our position that the burden of proof is upon the respondent, that it would have been upon the plaintiffs in the lawsuit to prove, because if the contention is that Arizona discriminated by not seeking the use of unisex annuity tables, the question would be Arizona discriminated because it didn't ask for or take unisex annuity tables, I think, just as in the other Title 7 cases where an employee who contends he or she was discriminated against by not being given a job, you must show that the job was available.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.883" offset="1316816">Therefore, I think the burden, Your Honor, is on the... on the plaintiff to prove that it was available and Arizona deliberately did not take it.</text>

            <label>Mr. John L. Endicott</label>
            <text syncTime="302.362" offset="1358717">I believe so.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.065" offset="1361538">The Arizona plan, again unlike Manhart, is a voluntary plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.969" offset="1389228">No one has to join.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.516" offset="1395393">No one has to contribute.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.874" offset="1400826">The employee under the Arizona plan can take home his or her entire wage or compensation if he or she so elects.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.761" offset="1436353">In fact, the employee can do what he or she chooses with his or her money, and it is our position that permitting someone to do something is not discriminating against someone.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.788" offset="1488493">In the Arizona plan, again, unlike Manhart, the contributions are equal, equal in the sense that the employee is free to make whatever contribution he or she chooses.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.142" offset="1533842">There are minimum and maximum limits, but any male employee can contribute the same amount as any female employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.139" offset="1569891">Again, therefore, there is no difference in the take-home pay that a male or a female employe receives.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.385" offset="1602805">In the Arizona plan, another distinction is, there is no contribution by the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.303" offset="1634465">The plan is funded entirely by contributions by the employee, and as a matter of fact, under the statute which created the plan, the employer, the state, cannot make a contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.861" offset="1680754">The... Only the employee funds are involved, and similarly situated employees receive the same compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.857" offset="1728715">Now, there is a difference between the Arizona deferred compensation plan and the Arizona retirement plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.807" offset="1756510">That plan is funded by employer contributions, and in that plan, where the plan is underwritten by the employer, the payments are the same for male and female employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.801" offset="1804470">Another distinction from Manhart under the Arizona plan is that the Arizona plan offers various options to the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.469" offset="1847207">They have choices available to them both in the form of the investment that is made with their money while they are putting their money into the plan, and in the form in which they take their money out.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.136" offset="1897884">One option, as suggested by this Court in Manhart, is a lump sum payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.962" offset="1925156">The employee's funds are invested over the working career of the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.147" offset="1941874">Those funds earn interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.116" offset="1949816">When the employee reaches the proper age under the plan, there is a given finite amount accumulated for that employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.940" offset="1981058">That employee is free to take that entire amount out in cash.</text>

            <text syncTime="516.651" offset="2215951">As I was saying, one of the choices of the lump sum, and as Your Honor points out, there is a tax consequence, there is a second choice, which is an annuity for a fixed term.</text>

            <text syncTime="570.098" offset="2429737">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, at the luncheon recess I was discussing the options which are available under the Arizona deferred compensation plan, and I had mentioned the fact that the employees can select the lump sum payment, a fixed term annuity, and the third option which is available is the life annuity.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.090" offset="2509672">In that one, in the lump sum and the fixed term, the treatment of males and females is equal.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.619" offset="2539765">They both get the same lump sum payment or the same monthly payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.587" offset="2551677">In the life annuity, the actuarial values of the payments are equal, but the monthly payments are different.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.881" offset="2580830">The woman gets a lower monthly payment, and it is that aspect of the annuity and the program which has brought us here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.953" offset="2617088">But nothing is available... nothing was available at the times here involved on the open market which was more favorable to women in the form of life annuities.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.701" offset="2656062">I think it is fair to state that the plan offerings truly reflect the open market, and the decisions of this Court in General Electric versus Gilbert, Harris versus McRae, and indeed in Manhart itself, all hold that the employer is not responsible for the fact that the open market may treat women differently than it treats men.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.130" offset="2741848">Nothing makes it illegal for insurance companies as opposed to employers, but nothing makes it illegal for insurance companies to recognize the different risks presented by men and women, and to treat women according to the risks they present.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.747" offset="2808304">I submit also that this case is a misuse of Title 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.839" offset="2828679">The plaintiffs' complaint in this case is not really with anything that Arizona has done as an employer, but is with the insurance industry practice of giving economic effect to the fact that women live longer than men.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.163" offset="2885940">The plaintiffs are using Title 7 in this case to punish the employer for what the insurance industry has done, third party insurers, and this Court in Footnote 33 in Manhart said that Title 7 does not govern the relations between employees and third parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.279" offset="2966397">It governs relations between employers and employees, but not with third parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.870" offset="2984787">The Manhart opinion suggested that if a corporate shell was used, that was a different case, but there is no evidence in this case that there is a corporate shell.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.022" offset="3029404">The insurance companies are independent and long-standing life insurance companies, third parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.458" offset="3051138">The insurance companies are not the agents of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.940" offset="3065035">This Court held in General Building Contractors fairly recently that one of the elements of agency is the ability to control, and there is no showing that Arizona had the ability to control the insurers in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1759.851" offset="7188725">The answer to that question is unequivocally no.</text>

            <text syncTime="3219.619" offset="13027824">Nathalie Norris will receive less month to month than a similarly situated man, and that is what Manhart proscribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.068" offset="13065545">In addition, there was a suggestion made by Mr. Endicott that this merely reflects the open market, and that this somehow falls within the term open market that this Court referred to in Manhart, but there, this Court held that an employer can give an employee a lump sum amount and go out and buy whatever he or she can on the open market.</text>

            <text syncTime="3269.132" offset="13225832">The issue, Your Honors, in this case is one of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.850" offset="13248715">Congress has determined the scope, the applicability of Title 7, and its prohibitions, and in this case the employer has violated Title 7 by providing a discriminatory fringe benefit to its employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.811" offset="13320500">Neither the involvement of the insurance companies or the presence of the options in this case are sufficient to overcome the statutory prohibition of Title 7.</text>

            <text syncTime="3321.581" offset="13435648">There were questions early in Ms. Gittler's argument about who holds title to the money and where the money goes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.422" offset="13458949">Now, as the Court knows, this is a deferred compensation plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.216" offset="13474204">Internal Revenue takes the position that if the employee receives the money, it is taxable at the time of receipt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.135" offset="13497819">So the law is structured so that the employee does not actually receive or constructively receive the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.258" offset="13522374">But the money is actually put with the insurance company, the savings bank, the mutual fund, or wherever the employee directs it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.241" offset="13546302">The promise by the state to return that money is an unequivocal promise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.770" offset="13564379">The only way the state could not do it is to breach its promise.</text>

            <text syncTime="3362.064" offset="13597607">In response to your suggestion that only the female rate would be available if you tried to have a unisex table, she responded in two ways, as I understood her, saying, one, the group policy may get a better rate than an individual, and secondly, that because of the tax benefit that you just described, the individual couldn't buy as favorable a policy even as the female rate would produce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.211" offset="13690185">Is there anything in the record to answer that question?</text>

            <text syncTime="3440.376" offset="13910763">The statement was made that Manhart solves this case, and I submit Manhart does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.467" offset="13931138">Manhart dealt with a situation in which the woman took home less money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.842" offset="13944617">It confined itself to that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.637" offset="13955798">Here is a case where the woman takes home the same pay throughout her life.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.948" offset="13969068">It is only after her employment status has ceased, she has retired, she is getting money from an insurance company, that she gets less per month.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.257" offset="14002296">And the assumption that because she gets less per month she is being discriminated against is one that again raises more questions than just simple mathematics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.299" offset="14046495">If I promise to pay you $50 a month for 20 months, and I promise to pay someone else $100 a month for ten months, clearly $50 a month is less than $100 a month, but it doesn't mean the person who gets $50 a month is being discriminated against.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.670" offset="14099994">They are going to get it longer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.918" offset="14108980">They will net out the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.199" offset="14114100">And the assumption of the actuarial tables is, you take the money the employee has set aside, divide it by their life expectancy, and they recoup their money, and it is their money they are concerned with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.101" offset="14157672">The argument that Arizona could have self-insured is contrary to the Arizona statute that created the deferred compensation plan, which said that Arizona was not to contribute money to the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.299" offset="14198528">Once you self-insure, you are taking the risk of insurance, and insurance companies do pay money out, sometimes more than they take.</text>
