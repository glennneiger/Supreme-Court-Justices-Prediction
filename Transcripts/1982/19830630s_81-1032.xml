            <text syncTime="21.948" offset="180084">It is, under what conditions attorneys for the Civil Division of the Justice Department and their paralegal and secretarial staff may obtain access to grand jury materials compiled under direction of other Justice Department attorneys compiled -- and whether they can obtain access to such for the purpose of preparing in pursuing a civil suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.163" offset="300875">On an opinion filed today with the clerk, we hold that attorneys in the Civil Division of the Justice Department and their assistants and staff may not obtain automatic disclosure of grand jury materials for use in a civil suit, but must instead seek court order under Rule 6(e)(3)(C)(i) for access to such materials.</text>
