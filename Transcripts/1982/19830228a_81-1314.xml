            <text syncTime="37.486" offset="295142">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, this case arises here on a petition for certiorari of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.250" offset="326175">It involves two arbitration issues in the tension between Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the seniority layoff provisions of a collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.950" offset="364941">In 1973, the EEOC investigated the company's plant in Mississippi and found that there was probable cause to believe that the company had discriminated in its hiring practices on the basis of sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.398" offset="418753">In 1974, the company and the union which whom it had a collective bargaining agreement, bargained a new collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.081" offset="449473">At the time, both the union and the company knew of the EEOC's findings, knew that the EEOC was seeking a conciliation agreement which might disrupt the seniority layoff provisions of the collective bargaining agreement, but nonetheless entered into a new collective bargaining agreement, retaining--</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="92.467" offset="514988">Mr. Nash, you said the union had notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.856" offset="524601">Does that suggest or do you think that the union was bound by what the company agreed to with the EEOC?</text>

            <text syncTime="101.088" offset="549470">--Not necessarily so, Your Honor, but that becomes relevant later on when we get to the argument about the court order that enjoined the company and the union, and whether or not that's a valid defense to a breach of contract action.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.035" offset="597326">On December 11, 1974, the company and the EEOC entered into a conciliation agreement which changed or would change the layoff provisions of the collective bargaining agreement by providing that if there is a layoff in the plant, females must be retained in the workforce in the same percentage at the end of the layoff as they were at the beginning of the layoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.996" offset="685098">The reason for that being to protect those recently hired female employees from layoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.821" offset="708399">On December 19, 1974, the company had a layoff of some employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.508" offset="727207">A few more were laid off in the early part of 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.333" offset="746433">The union filed grievances contending that those layoffs violated the collective bargaining agreement because some more senior men were laid off whereas junior seniority women were retained.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.500" offset="795126">The company amended and then complained in the then present law suit seeking to enjoin the union from processing those grievances to arbitration, added the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission as a defendant and sought a declaratory judgment from the court as to which should apply, the provisions of the EEOC conciliation agreement or the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="229.956" offset="1065023">First of all, we are dealing with a collective bargaining agreement and an EEOC conciliation agreement, neither of which have historically by this Court been treated as standard commercial contracts.</text>

            <text syncTime="563.420" offset="2398835">All of the senior males were immediately returned to work, and there is no contention here that the company continued to "violate the collective bargaining agreement" after the District Court's order was reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.416" offset="2446796">All the men were in fact brought back.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.557" offset="2455364">But there has been no award of back-pay for Mr. Jowers.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.335" offset="2474486">The second arbitrator, Mr. Barrett, was confronted by the union's contention in that arbitration that he did not have to follow the Sabella award because the Sabella award was considering or considered different factual circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.063" offset="2533418">The union contended in that arbitration that Sabella had dealt with a bumping.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.890" offset="2552748">Indeed, Mr. Jowers, rather than having been laid out of the workforce, had merely been bumped from his job down to a lower job, and then ultimately laid off.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.215" offset="2582006">Whereas the three subsequent cases that were now being argued before Mr. Barrett involved actual layoffs of senior males from the workforce.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.336" offset="2618472">The union contended that these involved different situations, different fact situations, and therefore arbitrator Barrett was not bound by the earlier award of Mr. Sabella.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.285" offset="2662254">The arbitrator in that case, arbitrator Barrett, found that in fact the cases involved exactly the same issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.486" offset="2691093">He found, however, that Mr. Sabella had exceeded his jurisdiction and authority by not referring to the collective bargaining agreement, but by merely finding that it wasn't fair to hold the company liable because it did what a court said it ought to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.042" offset="2741352">Mr. Barrett ordered back-pay for all of the employees affected by that layoff during the pendency of the court order.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.852" offset="2772595">I think it is important to note at this point that the case was tried before arbitrator Barrett and has been tried all the way through the courts as if all of the layoffs here were involved with the court order... followed the court order rather than before the court order.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.472" offset="2831005">Indeed, the company raised the distinction between layoffs under the conciliation agreement pre-court order and layoffs that occurred after the court order in the District Court on the initial motions for summary judgment, but noted at that time that the parties had not arbitrated the case based on those distinctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.557" offset="2895370">The union never picked up on the distinction, nor did the District Court, nor did the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.760" offset="2916164">As a consequence, the case we submit comes before you as if all of these layoffs occurred following the court order.</text>

            <text syncTime="761.341" offset="3190554">Indeed, what we have here is the union... The union filed the first motion for summary judgment in this case in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.510" offset="3219184">It contended in there that the Barrett award cannot stand because the Sabella arbitration award has to fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.789" offset="3248337">It has to fall, number one... Barrett is not required to follow Sabella for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.442" offset="3266936">Number one, Sabella decided a different issue, therefore, Barrett doesn't have to decide that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.489" offset="3283132">Secondly, Sabella went beyond his jurisdiction and authority, therefore, his award is void.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.938" offset="3312912">The union asked the District Court to determine whether or not, as a matter of law under legal precedent, that award would have been "enforceable", and contended that it was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.901" offset="3356797">As a consequence, the Barrett award did not... Barrett did not have to follow that award.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.508" offset="3379158">The union started the law suit not in any way by saying that there was any reference due to Mr. Barrett.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.443" offset="3402877">But indeed started the whole argument and the whole law suit on the basis that if the Sabella award stands, Barrett must fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.128" offset="3441643">If the Sabella award does not stand, then Barrett must be approved and must be enforced.</text>

            <text syncTime="870.765" offset="3628157">--I think an examination of that language will not indicate that the union at any time argued that any deference was due to Mr. Barrett's award.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.451" offset="3654907">Indeed, the reason for that language, if we are talking about the same, is that the company had argued in the District Court and again in the Fifth Circuit that even Barrett couldn't determine as a procedural matter whether or not the Sabella award was valid initially because the union had never brought a law suit to set aside the Sabella award in a timely manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.723" offset="3735991">Accordingly, everybody was foreclosed from contesting whether or not the Sabella award was valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.971" offset="3756993">I believe the language you'll find in the union's brief in the Fifth Circuit says, no, that is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.563" offset="3779354">We are not foreclosed because we didn't bring a law suit in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.687" offset="3791893">Indeed, we could give this issue to Barrett to make a determination, but, but that determination is not binding upon the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.497" offset="3823135">Ultimately, the Barrett award or whatever Barrett had to say would be determined in the courts based upon whether or not the courts, using court precedent, would have enforced the Sabella award.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.212" offset="3869947">Yes, I think the language might be susceptible to the question you pose, except for the fact that that was clearly in response to a totally different argument not present in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.894" offset="3908712">At no time did the union ever argue that Barrett's award was due any deference by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.985" offset="3933059">It was a flat-out argument that the court must decide whether the Sabella award is valid, and on that decision rides or falls the decision on whether or not to enforce the Barrett award.</text>

            <text syncTime="972.288" offset="4034309">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.818" offset="4044445">Initially, I note that the government will only address the third issue presented in the petition for writ of certiorari because that is the only issue in which the government has a particular interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.392" offset="4082688">We do note that the resolution of the third issue is itself contingent on the proper disposition of the first two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.235" offset="4110064">If the Court decides either of the first two issues in favor of the petitioner, then there will be no reason to address the issue of special concern to Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.855" offset="4152592">The Commission is the Federal agency vested with the primary duty under Title VII to eliminate discrimination in the workplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.804" offset="4180386">In performing this mission, Congress expressly obliged the Commission to attempt in the first instance to conciliate employment discrimination disputes in order to resolve them, if at all possible, without having to resort to judicial proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.017" offset="4237228">Through this informal conciliation process, the Commission every year resolves literally hundreds of cases, in some years even thousands of cases, without having to consume a single second of judicial time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.780" offset="4284249">Conciliation is thus properly regarded both by Congress and the Commission as the most appropriate means of resolving employment discrimination disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.133" offset="4329702">Indeed, it is central to the Commission's ability to perform its mission, given the large number of Title VII cases that come before the Commission and the relatively limited resources the Commission has to dispose of those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.425" offset="4374841">The Commission submits that it is central to its ability to conciliate disputes that collective bargaining agreements that conflict with arguable requirements of Title VII must be set aside, and that the conciliation agreement that is reached must be given a place of preeminence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.964" offset="4456970">Thus, to the extent that an arbitrator grants the union compensation for breach of a collective bargaining agreement caused by the employer's reliance on a reasonable conciliation agreement, that award must be vacated on review by a Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.256" offset="4506185">In taking this position, the Commission appreciates the importance to the national labor policy both of collective bargaining agreements in general and of arbitrations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.440" offset="4542861">But what is equally obvious is the importance of the national policy under Title VII of eliminating discrimination in the workplace and of remedying completely the effects of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.794" offset="4584343">Both policies govern employment relationships.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.497" offset="4603152">Obviously, they have overlapping coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.479" offset="4615063">In some instances they conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.556" offset="4627393">In six circumstances where the Title VII requirements and the collective bargaining agreement conflict, this Court has made clear that the requirements of Title VII must prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.756" offset="4672219">In the Emporium Capwell decision, the Court expressly stated that when the agreement of the union and the employer conflict with the law, even though that law is found by means of the conciliation efforts of the Commission, the agreement between the employer and the union must be set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.046" offset="4733346">Our submission is that that ruling or that statement must apply just as much in the process of a conciliation agreement based on a reasonable determination of what the law requires at the time of the conciliation as it would if this issue were finally settled by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.227" offset="4802100">In our view, in following reasonable conciliation agreements in disregard of the collective bargaining agreements, the best balance is the relevant interest at stake in these kinds of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.769" offset="4840239">The result is proper primarily because it encourages settlements with employers that otherwise might be deterred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.111" offset="4865630">In addition, the process of following the conciliation agreements serves as a significant prod to the union to have it involved in the conciliation process.</text>

They would not have been within the proceeding itself since they had not been charged with violating Title VII, although it does seem that there is a concert of action of sorts that leads to the result that there are no women in the production units at the Southbridge plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.202" offset="5509914">We suggest that the relevant interests of the various parties at stake, in this case we submit, leads to the conclusion that the conciliation agreement ought to be followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.180" offset="5561846">We have already discussed the union's interest in this case, in having them participate in the negotiation process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.240" offset="5586087">I think it is also important to realize that the incumbent employees' interests in this case are not violated by virtue of following the conciliation agreement in most instances because, as in this case, the original award in this case followed at that point the judicial decree, but presumably might very well have followed the conciliation agreement itself as a reasonable statement of what the law required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.935" offset="5676889">This collective bargaining agreement contains an illegality clause in it, and thus the reasonable expectations of the employees must be that their collective bargaining rights must give way if Federal law otherwise requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.413" offset="5730806">Accordingly, by following the conciliation agreement no real violence is ofttimes done to the arbitral process at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.254" offset="5750136">On the other hand, by following the arbitral process, the employer is completely deprived of any opportunity for some sort of a safe harbor that has been called into question by the EEOC's action in asking them to agree to a particular agreement and, in turn, it will serve as, I think, a clear deterrent in most future cases for any employer to agree to any form of conciliation agreement that requires modification of the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.199" offset="5845953">That result, we submit, is just unwarranted in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.166" offset="5857761">The Federal policy of high settlement of Title VII suits should be the controlling factor in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.382" offset="5882629">Since the decision of the Fifth Circuit disregards the conciliation agreement for all intents and purposes, and uphold the second award strictly on the basis of the collective bargaining agreement, we submit that that decision must be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1456.608" offset="5971550">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.825" offset="5988477">As we understand this matter at this juncture, there are four questions before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.541" offset="6019302">The first we will label the arbitration clause question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.397" offset="6046783">The second, what Mr. Nash has stated as the concession question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.987" offset="6081055">Third concerns the District Court order, and the last the EEOC conciliation agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.188" offset="6113865">I intend, if that is permissible, to address those question in that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.419" offset="6138838">With regard to the substance of the question concerning the arbitration award, this is a case by the company to overturn a particular arbitration award, the award rendered by arbitrator Barrett and called the Barrett award.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.755" offset="6216161">Arbitrator Barrett was faced with a threshold issue in considering the grievances filed with him, which is quite common, namely, what deference if any is to be accorded to a prior arbitrator's award in dealing with the same aspects of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.635" offset="6323681">Arbitrator Barrett determined not to follow the prior award, the so-called Sabella award, which had never been taken to court and was a preexisting determination concerning the meaning of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.064" offset="6401421">He did so after quite a painstaking and thorough evaluation of the prior award.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.700" offset="6447919">He did so by erecting that is a far higher standard than arbitrators normally follow in determining whether or not to follow a prior award.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.600" offset="6515524">He determined not to follow the prior award.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.597" offset="6535586">He came to the conclusion that his obligation in deciding what the express terms of the agreement meant compelled him to look at the agreement to look at the agreement itself and not to handle the matter as arbitrator Sabella had done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.649" offset="6631717">His actions, as I say, were in accord with the normal way arbitrators handle this matter and, if anything, more favorable, far more favorable to the company than is the norm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.831" offset="6696500">In addition, the lower court law is uniform that there is no requirement of law, no Section 301 requirement of arbitral stare decisis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.218" offset="6746028">The parties can bargain about that as they bargain about other matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.090" offset="6765463">After arbitrator Barrett issued his award, the company was dissatisfied with it, and as is its right, went to court to overturn that award.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.865" offset="6820634">We believe that the proper question here, the analytic question that ought to be faced is what standard is the Barrett award insofar as Barrett refused to follow the earlier Sabella award to be judged by.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.905" offset="6892732">It is our submission that the standard is the one stated in this Court's Enterprise case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.542" offset="6931289">Did arbitrator Barrett, in fulfilling his obligation, issue an award that draws its essence from the collective bargaining agreement and did he decide... did he interpret the contract since the arbitrator is charged with--</text>

            <text syncTime="1892.962" offset="7716948">They want an interpretation of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.853" offset="7724575">The law is perfectly well settled, however, that if an arbitration award is contrary to public law, the courts will set it aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.802" offset="7764386">So that is why I say that it depends at different stages--</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.206" offset="7773999">We have noted in our brief, and there is simply no room, I think, either in theory or in terms of this Court's precedents, that an arbitration award that is contrary to Title VII is no good.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.872" offset="7832618">The question we have here posed by the government is whether an arbitration award that accords with Title VII somehow is subordinate to the EEOC on what Title VII might and ought to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.771" offset="7908268">On that we most definitely part company with the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.971" offset="7929062">But in terms of the question you raised, there is discord and division at the arbitral stage, but none at all at the judicial stage, or in this Court's precedents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.700" offset="7979948">As I started to say, we believe that the proper approach in evaluating what arbitrator Barrett did with regard to the Sabella award is stated in Enterprise Wheel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.587" offset="8035537">Did the second arbitrator, the arbitrator, whose award the Plaintiff seeks to satisfy, draw the essence of his award from the contract?</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.939" offset="8096872">If the answer to that question is, yes, we believe the proceeding is at an end.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.999" offset="8121114">We suggest that if that rule is not the rule, Enterprise Wheel would be severely cut back to the detriment of the arbitration system and to the detriment of the contract system... I mean the judicial system, for it is a very rare situation in which there has only been one arbitration that can even be said to arguably touch on an issue of contract interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.722" offset="8243994">If the courts, either in this proceeding or generally, are called upon to say, in general, interpreting the contract is for the arbitrator, but it is for us on a de novo theory to determine whether the arbitrator correctly interpreted the final and binding clause which is no more or less a part of the agreement than any other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.040" offset="8341274">I can guarantee you that all the cases that used to come up to court on the theory that the Enterprise standard had not been met, that the arbitrator had failed to draw the essence of his award from the contract, will now come to the courts on a new theory to take advantage of the broader and more generous scope of judicial review, namely, that the award is inconsistent with the prior award, or that the arbitrator misinterpreted his obligations under the final and binding section of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.976" offset="8497068">We believe that that would be directly contrary to Congress's intent in Sections 203(d) and 301, and to the sound administration of this system of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.268" offset="8546179">Now we come to the supposed default of the union which would preclude a consideration of the argument I have just made, an argument, I would note, that is nowhere answered on its merits in the reply brief of the company, a very thorough and able reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.478" offset="8639070">To go back to the starting point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.445" offset="8654952">This law suit is not a law suit by the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.819" offset="8668432">This is a law suit by the company, brought by the company to set aside an arbitration award.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.910" offset="8696748">The company had a theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.144" offset="8701764">The company came into court and said: There is arbitration award No. 1, the Sabella award, and arbitration No. 2, the Barrett award.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.654" offset="8743769">Unless arbitration award No. 1 is not in the refined terms used here, not subject to being overturned in court, then arbitration award No. 2 is no good.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.304" offset="8810329">That was the essence of the company's theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.506" offset="8827152">The union's brief, which the Court, of course, asked us for a copy of and which all parties have, dealt with that argument in two parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.063" offset="8897369">Part No. 1, looking at page 11 of the union's Court of Appeals brief is headed:</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.557" offset="8935403">"Arbitrator Sabella's award is clearly void and unenforceable, and entitled to no binding effect on subsequent arbitrations between the parties as a result of Arbitrator Sabella exceeding his contractual authority. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.598" offset="8995589">The next argument is:</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.907" offset="9032788">"Arbitrator Barrett acted within his jurisdictional authority in determining the effect of Arbitrator Sabella's earlier award. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.341" offset="9074479">I would be less than candid, and also I don't bear the burden of having had to deal with this case under the time schedules and exigencies of lower court deadlines, if I did not squarely admit that the link between argument one and argument two is not made with complete precision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.924" offset="9180850">I am afraid that in the Eye of God I won't be able to link those with absolute precision either.</text>

            <text syncTime="2561.756" offset="10392200">The third of the questions that I have listed concerns the effect of the District Court's order on companies' contract liabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.126" offset="10441623">The company argues that the proper rule is that once the District Court entered its order, the company could not be held liable for contract damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.260" offset="10494182">Like the first of the questions presented, we believe that that was a contract question for arbitrator Barrett to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.631" offset="10543710">The question of when a court order is, for want of a better term, the basis of a claim of impossibility of performance which relieves one of paying damages for a contract breach is not a de novo one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.606" offset="10631586">The general law is that such an order provides an impossibility defense only if the party claiming that defense has not been at any fault in securing the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.458" offset="10710998">The company plainly can't satisfy that standard here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.612" offset="10739628">The original suit was brought by the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.907" offset="10752794">The company amended its original complaint to allege that the conciliation agreement was superior to the collective agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.357" offset="10798561">I skipped a step.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.183" offset="10805875">The company entered into the conciliation agreement after the collective agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.198" offset="10821966">The company amended its complaint to say that the conciliation agreement was superior.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.650" offset="10839730">The company aligned itself with the EEOC, when the EEOC sought an order to prevent execution of the collective agreement and to prevent the arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.613" offset="10899602">The company, like the union, sought no stay of the District Court order that was eventually entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.780" offset="10936278">Certainly, in terms of the equitable standard used in general, the company cannot invoke that defense as arbitrator Barrett concluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.308" offset="10986329">Moreover, this agreement has an express savings clause which provides that the agreement is not enforceable if contrary to law and, as matters have turned out, this agreement is not contrary to law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.380" offset="11058636">The collective agreement is not contrary to law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.036" offset="11069294">That being true, and against the background stated, again we believe that judged as it ought to be judged under the Enterprise standard, what arbitrator Barrett concluded, namely, that the company should not be relieved of its contract liability is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.947" offset="11152886">The company argues here that collective agreements are not commercial agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.928" offset="11188830">We could not agree more, but nothing comes of that in our view that is any help to the company because in this Court's cases, and most particularly the Carbon Fuel case in 444 U.S., the Court has made it plain that Congress's point in enacting Section 301, and indeed the point overall of the national labor policy, is to provide for stability through free collective bargaining and to provide that agreements once reached are to be followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.805" offset="11336370">So long as they are lawful, they are to be followed without administrative intervention, without executive intervention, and without judicial intervention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.333" offset="11374508">We would think that the general contract rule, which embodies a good deal of wisdom in itself, applies with a vengeance in the situation of collective bargaining agreements.</text>

            <text syncTime="2859.186" offset="11581921">If the company, having taken the gamble it did against the background of the law, had been proved right, this agreement would not have been... the collective agreement would not have been subject to enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.883" offset="11636673">Arbitrator Barrett's award would have been subject to having been overturned as contrary to Title VII.</text>

            <text syncTime="2882.567" offset="11675439">But we believe that it strains Title VII far past the breaking point to say that the EEOC, which Congress did not give the power to adjudicate claims or to enter orders... I just was looking for words of Alexander versus Gardner Denver... the Commission cannot adjudicate claims or impose administrative sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.539" offset="11811276">It would be extraordinarily surprising and wholly irrational to conclude that the EEOC can nonetheless enter into a conciliation agreement with A by which B's rights... contract rights are destroyed, and to say that that conciliation agreement, even though it can't stand the test of being placed against the law in a court, is superior to the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.351" offset="11962577">We think that not only did Congress not grant any such broad powers to the Commission, but as this Court has noted and most recently in the California Brewers case, again in 444 U.S., Title VII was drafted against the background of the national labor policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.386" offset="12074695">As the Court said there,</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.495" offset="12083158">"It does not behoove the courts to second guess the processes of collective bargaining. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.164" offset="12109803">Certainly this agency was not given the power to second guess those processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.241" offset="12130074">It was given the power to take people into court if they could not arrange a conciliation and to demonstrate that what they had was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.722" offset="12168004">Only after that is done, only after the courts have made the findings of fact necessary, is there room for a binding court order which denies somebody a contract right or a right derived from any other source.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.401" offset="12234773">In concluding, I would like to address the point that somehow that view will end the conciliation system with regard to situations involving collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.833" offset="12288481">There is no substance to that because this is not a zero-sum game where only the employer is at jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.986" offset="12325052">If the union was presented with the conciliation here, and it took the view that the agreement, the collective bargaining agreement was lawful and it wanted to stick with it--</text>

            <text syncTime="3077.100" offset="12453575">First, the employer put in their defense, and then the decree was entered.</text>

            <text syncTime="3082.738" offset="12476144">--Well, in the situations of that kind, Your Honor, what I understand the law to be is that the courts have ample power in determining who has... who bears the liabilities stemming from an unlawful collective agreement, to impose those liabilities on whoever is at fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.117" offset="12597666">If an employer either said,</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.115" offset="12605607">"We want to change this contract. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.536" offset="12619295">or said,</text>

            <text syncTime="3122.049" offset="12633297">the union is put at great jeopardy if it does not agree to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.861" offset="12656598">So the imperatives for the union to enter into the conciliation process in many cases are precisely the same as the imperatives that drive anyone into conciliation, a desire to bring one's situation into conformity with law, a desire to avoid the cost of litigation, costs which most unions are not in as good a position as most companies to deal with, and a desire to safeguard against potential liabilities.</text>

            <text syncTime="3218.106" offset="13017610">Clearly, what is the essence of our concern about the last of the arguments the company makes is that it is designed to either force the union to attack a conciliation agreement to get into court, or to deny a union, which believes that its collective bargaining agreement is lawful which has the contract rights of those who are covered by the agreement to defend, any opportunity to defend them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.420" offset="13158776">We don't believe that Title VII denies unions that opportunity or takes away contract rights in that way, and we would have the gravest due process doubts of the validity of any statute which had the effect of taking these contract rights away through an agreement between the government and A.</text>

            <text syncTime="3340.135" offset="13505682">The only difference is that this court order ultimately was reversed on appeal by the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.525" offset="13523237">The question then is, is the employer or the union in this case, for they too were enjoined, to be excused from breaching the collective bargaining agreement in complying with the court order during the time that the court order was in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.363" offset="13570570">We contend that, indeed, they were.</text>

            <text syncTime="3407.000" offset="13773176">Number one, that the company entered into the conciliation agreement, but there is no indication in this case that that in fact was what resulted in the court order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.324" offset="13806404">There was a fully litigated case between the EEOC and the union as to whether or not there had been a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.477" offset="13835034">Ultimately, the court found, yes, the District Court, and said that the remedy for that would be a conciliation agreement, but there is no indication that in fact the court would not have come up with some remedy in any event in that litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.050" offset="13885398">It merely had the conciliation agreement to turn to, a conciliation agreement which, by the way, was relatively moderate and, indeed, might have protected more senior men than did the conciliation agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="3529.512" offset="14263233">Yet, the union argues that any valid, finely enforceable court order saying that there has been a violation of Title VII takes precedence over collective bargaining agreement, but there is no valid, finely enforceable Title VII order that isn't based upon the company's discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.240" offset="14322061">As a consequence, the union argues too much that, indeed, the company's prior discrimination cannot be a basis for saying that the employer is relieved from complying with the court order which changes that seniority system.</text>
