            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="92283">In the second of the two cases, Hewitt against Helms comes on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.398" offset="125824">Aaron Helms, the respondent, was serving a prison term in a Pennsylvania prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.290" offset="145364">During his term, he was involved in a riot which several prison guards were injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.768" offset="163336">As a result, the prison officials confined Helms to what they called “administrative segregation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="23.073" offset="184547">This meant that he would be restricted to his cell.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.804" offset="195414">The officials ordered this confinement because they believe Helms pose a threat to the security and safety of other prisoners and guards at the prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.449" offset="226030">They were also investigating the possibility that misconduct charges should be brought against him because of his role in the prison riot.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.488" offset="254138">Helms later sued the officials in the Federal District Court, claiming United States Constitution required the prison officials to hold a formal trial-like hearing before they could place him in an administrative segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.448" offset="301994">The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit agreed with Helms and held that he had a right to a special hearing to determine whether it is proper to place him in administrative segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.309" offset="337416">We have concluded that while Helms was guaranteed some protection under state law and the Due Process Clause, the prison officials afford him all of the Constitution required.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.519" offset="374301">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.728" offset="391124">Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion joined by Justice Brennan and Justice Marshall and in part by Justice Blackmun.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.524" offset="418291">Justice Blackmun has also filed an opinion concurring a part – concurring in part and dissenting in part.</text>
