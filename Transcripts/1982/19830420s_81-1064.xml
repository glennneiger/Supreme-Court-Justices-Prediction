            <text syncTime="7.909" offset="123980">The first case is City of Los Angeles against Lyons which is here in the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.430" offset="158044">The case began when Lyons -- the respondent, Lyons filed a complaint in United States District Court alleging that several months earlier he had been stopped for a traffic violation and that then without any provocation or legal excuse, the officer involved had choked him into unconsciousness and that he feared that the same thing would happen over again.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.791" offset="283536">He sought in separate counts both damages and an injunction against the use of any of the departmentally authorized chokeholds except where the officer is threatened or was threatened with deadly force.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.699" offset="355216">The District Court dismissed the injunctive count but the Court of Appeals reversed and the District Court then entered an injunction which the Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.912" offset="404013">We granted certiorari and we reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.461" offset="422194">We hold that although Lyons had ample standing to seek damages from what happened to him, he did not have standing to seek the injunction which he sought or which was entered by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.244" offset="489381">So, we reverse the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.588" offset="498680">Justice Marshall joined by Justices Brennan, Blackmun, and Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
