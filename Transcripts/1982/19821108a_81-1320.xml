            <text syncTime="6.389" offset="175332">Mr. Petersen, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="a_wells_petersen" startTime="28.286" stopTime="227.517">
            <label>Mr. A. Wells Petersen</label>
            <text syncTime="28.286" offset="262894">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="30.676" offset="272507">Appellants are asking this Court to find California's Penal Code Section 647(e), as interpreted by People v. Solomon, constitutional; furthermore, that when the statute is properly applied, it satisfies the Fourth Amendment criteria; and finally, that when the police acting properly under the statute request a person to identify themselves, that that does not violate their rights under the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.852" offset="397163">Now, the facts normally in a case like a Terry stop case, the facts are normally quite important and very relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.096" offset="434153">In this particular case, the facts surrounding the stop of Mr. Lawson are not relevant because the matter will go back down for a trial at the district court level, a jury trial on the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.810" offset="485039">Therefore, I think it would be inappropriate and really they're not relevant to a decision today, not at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.121" offset="514296">It is first critical to review Appellants' claim that the statute is constitutional as interpreted by the Solomon court, and our first premise is that because of Solomon, with Terry, we have clear standards that proscribe the police in enforcing the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.642" offset="600396">Now, the court below recognized the statute engrafted the guidelines from Terry through Solomon.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.513" offset="635818">Therefore, before 647(e) ever comes into play the police must have articulable facts demonstrating their belief was reasonable that the person was acting in a suspicious manner relating to criminal activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.678" offset="724530">This standard and guideline ensures a tempered act of a policeman.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.017" offset="757862">As this Court held recently in Cortez, the police action must be considered in light of the total circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.436" offset="795478">The police then act on probabilities, after considering the data at their disposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.916" offset="829438">And it would be impossible to write either a statute or an opinion that encompassed every conceivable situation that could be considered suspicious, and that's a point conceded by Appellee.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.971" offset="901640">But it isn't even necessary, because we have Terry that sets forth adequate standards against which the police activity is measured.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.529" offset="947929">Now, Terry obviously was both loitering and wandering for a criminal purpose, which therefore required the police to respond because the public safety demanded it.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.165" offset="998398">Now, Terry provides the standards not only for stops, but also probable cause to arrest, and while those standards may lack machine tool precision--</text>

            <text syncTime="245.088" offset="1130159">But while these standards may lack, as I say, the precision that some may wish, they certainly have provided constitutional guidelines since their inception that have guided courts throughout the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.689" offset="1216572">And California has only memorialized the Terry stop by statute and court opinion intertwined to give us a solid basis upon which to judge these matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.543" offset="1271952">Certainly, the standard imposed upon the police to articulate what they perceive as criminal activity is no more onerous than we placed on the police in making a stop, a driving while intoxicated stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.490" offset="1339766">Solomon also provides the second leg of the standard, a standard for what satisfies the request for identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.469" offset="1387622">It must be to a reasonable policeman reliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.184" offset="1414476">Now, while this may present some problem to some, we ask all sorts of people to make decisions on reliability.</text>

          <turn speaker="mark_d_rosenbaum" startTime="1684.152" stopTime="1930.460">
            <label>Mr. Mark D. Rosenbaum</label>
            <text syncTime="1684.152" offset="6886398">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.901" offset="6901340">This case raises fundamental constitutional questions regarding the broad exercise and extension of police authority and the relationship between that authority and an individual in a free society.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.457" offset="6959645">Through 646(e), police make and enforce as elements of a criminal law requiring innocent persons to disclose proof of identification upon official demand, deliberately imprecise and evolving standards designed to govern investigatory activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.324" offset="7051074">Analysis of 646(e) therefore turns upon two basic concerns which, with the Court's permission, I will address this afternoon: first, whether incorporation of the so-called Terry standard as an element of a 646(e) offense, based upon the moment to moment decisionmaking by a police officer, deprives that statute of any objective core; and if so, whether it thereby impermissibly offends due process vagueness doctrine by encouraging arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement, by denying fair notice, and by trenching upon basic constitutional rights of privacy, security and mobility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.100" offset="7246156">And second, whether 647(e) works in two ways to undermine the central importance of the probable case requirement: whether it offends the Fourth Amendment by sanctioning intrusions upon individual security and privacy upon less than probable cause, and upon no other interest than the general one in crime prevention and detection, but not, as Mr. Petersen would have it, based upon whatever incremental advantage exists through the existence of a criminal sanction; and whether it also subverts Fourth Amendment guarantees by converting the power to make inquiry and to investigate upon less than probable cause into the power to arrest and search absent functionally at least the existence of probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.875" offset="7469242">Let me start with the vagueness issue, and let me pay particular attention to the issue which Justice O'Connor has raised, the question of whether or not the statute in fact requires persons within the state of California to carry and to display at all times upon official demand proof of identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.038" offset="7553983">For in practice 647(e) is functionally indistinguishable from the very sort of stop and identify statute in application which this Court specifically disapproved of in Brown versus Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.907" offset="7625454">The consequence of 647(e) is that in California there is a internal passport requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.309" offset="7658995">This is true because the basis for a Terry stop and demand, an officer's basis which Mr. Petersen described, is both unknown and unknowable to anyone but the detaining officer, including of course the individual detained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.551" offset="7739975">And this is true for two reasons that go to the heart of the Terry decision: First, the decision stop an individual under Terry is one that is peculiar dependent upon the skill and the experience and the training of the officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.901" offset="7817402">As Justice Powell stated in Mendenhall and as the Chief Justice has stated in court and in Brown versus Texas, this sort of skill and experience and training simply is not available to the average lay person.</text>

            <text syncTime="1930.460" offset="7871632">Would you say, then, that a case in which a Terry stop was made is not reviewable by the courts because it's so esoteric they just wouldn't know anything about it?</text>

            <text syncTime="1953.029" offset="7961911">But the critical point for our purposes with respect to notice is whether the individual on the street, the person who is being detained by the officer, can make a judgment at that time as to whether he or she wishes to state his or her rights under Brown versus Texas and say, I don't believe you have reasonable suspicion here, I don't want to have to disclose my identity to you, I want to rest upon my rights, or whether the person has any opportunity to make that sort of judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1995.199" offset="8130558">I would say first that if the statute had a probable cause requirement it would, first of all, probably be an unnecessary statute, because as Justice O'Connor indicated earlier, at that point the officer can conduct a search.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.505" offset="8183847">The officer can actually reach into the individual's pocket.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.270" offset="8194819">But with respect to the vagueness question that you're asking about, Justice Rehnquist, I would say it would be a close question, but I would say that there is a difference which this Court has recognized on numerous occasions between probable cause and reasonable suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.374" offset="8259289">Probable cause comes with a lot more freight, and in addition probable cause is a recognition in this society that we will accept different sorts of relationships between the individual and the law enforcement apparatus.</text>

            <text syncTime="2046.755" offset="8336820">Articulable suspicion is some sort of halfway house between probable cause and nothing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2090.410" offset="8511423">--Well, let me answer that in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.347" offset="8519155">First, as I indicated to Your Honor, it is a close question, but probable cause comes with a different set of freight and it is more understandable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.999" offset="8561787">Moreover, we are talking about a vagueness doctrine, and as this Court has repeatedly recognized, last time in the Hoffman Estates case, the drug paraphernalia case, the Mesquite case, the case involving the licensing ordinance, we will adjust our vagueness standards depending upon the constitutional rights that are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.598" offset="8656141">In the probable cause situation which you hypothesized, we are willing to draw perhaps a less strong line in terms of what we would expect from the individual himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.814" offset="8696997">But the basic point, of course, is that in the probable cause hypothesis that you state there simply is no need for the sort of statute that you're describing in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.028" offset="8737852">And returning again to the notice point that we're talking about, the problem of the individual on the street, not having the skill and the training and the experience of the officer, is compounded because quite fundamentally that individual simply doesn't have the information available to the officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.581" offset="8828132">What precipitates the Terry stop may be an informant's tip, as in Adams versus Williams, may be a DEA profile, as in Reed versus Georgia, it may simply be a call from the patrol car.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.857" offset="8881212">But whatever the basis of that information, the individual on the street, who ought to be able to decide comfortably with the knowledge that at the very minimum that individual has the rights guaranteed by this court in Brown versus Texas, simply has no way of making an assessment as to whether or not a forfeiture ought to exist here, whether or not it is proper to disclose identification.</text>

            <text syncTime="2228.792" offset="9064905">The other prong of the vagueness argument that I want to focus upon that complements this particular notice requirement is the fact that, as an incorporation of the Terry standard within 647(e), that incorporation means that the statute has no objective core.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.330" offset="9155080">It is like the Massachusetts flag desecration statute which this Court ruled unconstitutional in Smith versus Goguen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.483" offset="9191756">Like the phrase there, "treats contemptuously", there is no basis here for an objective standard because what is taking place here is that an element of the crime is being defined by the moment to moment decisionmaking of the officer on the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.414" offset="9259465">What 647(e) does is to codify an officer's suspicions regarding wrongdoing and then to criminalize the failure of an individual to allay those particular suspicions or to furnish information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.282" offset="9318920">And while we are perfectly willing, as a matter of recognizing the importance of investigations, to say that where that standard appears as part of an investigatory statute or part of an investigatory standard, to consciously relax our standards of vagueness--</text>

            <text syncTime="2339.466" offset="9507629">That's correct, because whether you look at vagueness or whether you look at the Fourth Amendment argument, what is inherent in this statute is a forfeiture of the rights of privacy and security and mobility that were guaranteed under Brown versus Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.786" offset="9584951">The arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement therefore flows from the use of this investigatory standard as one of the elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.424" offset="9623508">And as I indicated, while this Court has indicated, has stated that it will relax standards of vagueness in circumstances short of a criminal sanction, where the element becomes part of it different constitutional considerations flowing from the fact that a breach of a criminal statute results in arrest and imprisonment means that we have to use a tighter consideration.</text>

            <text syncTime="3008.102" offset="12182149">And that's one of the Fourth Amendment problems with the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3124.572" offset="12648069">And in this respect, I would direct the Court's attention to its decisions in Terry and Brignoni Ponce and Summers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.866" offset="12681297">In Terry, this Court stated that it would permit a frisk of an individual, non-stopped, upon less than probable cause but not upon a general interest in crime prevention or detection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.969" offset="12741692">Rather, the Terry frisk was specifically predicated upon preserving an officer's safety in circumstances that would warrant concern.</text>

            <text syncTime="3168.960" offset="12825598">And what we're looking at in this case is what will we permit short of probably cause in additional to estop.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.646" offset="12852347">And it is our position that this Court has never permitted an intrusion of this sort of character beyond the stop itself for an interest just from the generalized one, in crime prevention or detection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.827" offset="12913056">That's what Terry indicated with respect to the justification of the frisk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.263" offset="12930819">Let's look at Brignoni Ponce which I would contend in many ways controls this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.525" offset="12955896">Indeed, I would suggest that Mr. Petersen's argument simply cannot be squared with the holding of that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.694" offset="12984527">In Brignoni Ponce, this Court examined a roving patrol that was interested in determining whether or not aliens, in violation of immigration laws, were being transported.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.407" offset="13043459">And this Court stated that upon less than probable cause, upon reasonable suspicion, stop estop would be permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.483" offset="13075746">Now, what is significant about this case for our purposes here is that that particular style, that particular intrusion to ask questions regarding immigration status, was purely an investigatory act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.600" offset="13140216">It was no less investigatory than the sort of stops of Mr. Lawson that took place in the San Diego area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.207" offset="13166652">But what is critical here is that that investigatory stop was sanctioned not upon the general interest of crime prevention or detection which Mr. Petersen would like to sustain this statute on, but rather, was predicated very specifically on this nation's peculiar problems in the area of immigration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.229" offset="13266649">And the Court will recall Justice Powell, at pages 881 and 82, specifically stating that any further intrusion beyond asking about immigration status or asking about the suspicious circumstances regarding immigration would not be permitted under the Fourth Amendment; that there had to, at that point, be consent or probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.312" offset="13362989">So in circumstances remarkably identical to the circumstances here, the general interest in crime prevention or detection was not enough to sustain the intrusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.402" offset="13411367">And I would submit to this Court that that is predicated upon an understanding as to really the degree of advantage that law enforcement gains through the actual operation of a statute like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.128" offset="13474270">Not, as Mr. Petersen would have it, some sort of global discussion of crime prevention or detection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.955" offset="13497572">But rather, what is involved simply by having this particular statute available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.812" offset="13521082">Let's look at that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.858" offset="13525261">By Mr. Petersen's own tally, there are only some eight states in the Union, only some eight states, that even have statutes like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.762" offset="13564863">And neither Mr. Petersen nor any of the amiti filing papers on his behalf, has cited to this Court a single study or a single fact that would indicate that it is the existence of this statute that is responsible for the advantages gained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.068" offset="13642081">Nor would the statute itself preclude investigations from going forward, for as Justice White has indicated in his statements, the individual is still under police surveillance, the officers are still free to continue whatever surveillance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.717" offset="13716687">And perhaps the most interesting point of all flows from the record in this case, because when you examine the 15-odd stops that happened, in the majority of stops when the officer sought to attain information from Mr. Lawson regarding identification, they didn't use the statute as the basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.896" offset="13797353">That statute's advantage, as an increment to crime prevention or detection, while I'm not suggesting is insubstantial, while I'm not suggesting is non-existent, certainly is not of the sort or magnitude that would in any way cause the gross departure from the probable cause requirement that is stated here, that is suggested here by the government's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.589" offset="13896096">And it is really here in appreciation of that fact and in appreciation of the discussion that we had with respect to vagueness, that it becomes clear as to what this case is all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.411" offset="13955446">For it is here that the fundamental policies of vagueness and the Fourth Amendment coalesce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.673" offset="13980523">For while in circumstances short of probable cause, it may be our moral and civic judgment that individuals questioned by the police should respond, including even disclosure of identity, what finally defines the character of a free society and separates it from a totalitarian one is ultimately the relationship between the individual and the law enforcement apparatus... how much space exists, whether one is free, or whether one is subservient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.550" offset="14123988">And in the end, this case is much more than a case about the amenities of life.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.999" offset="14153767">What this case is about in a free society is nothing less than the integrity and the autonomy of the individual, and what our collective repugnance will be to an attempt to destroy those particular values.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.681" offset="14216461">If the Court has no further questions, I have completed my argument.</text>
