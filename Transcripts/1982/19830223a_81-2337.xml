            <label>Mr. Louis F. Claiborne</label>
            <text syncTime="11.836" offset="180846">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.291" offset="194639">This dispute is over the bed of the Little Missouri River in western North Dakota, so far as that river lies in that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.115" offset="229956">This is a river which has been described as a raging torrent in the summertime and a bare trickle in the winter.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.830" offset="264751">It is one as to which an explorer with the Lewis and Clark Expedition in 1804, after struggling down it for 45 days, emphatically declared it non-navigable.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.369" offset="310936">Nevertheless, the State of North Dakota now claims that bed on the ground that it was at the time of its admission to the state in 1889 and today a navigable stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.179" offset="362136">We put out of mind the last 35 miles or so of the stream where it borders or traverses an Indian reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.113" offset="393901">That portion of the riverbed is not at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.390" offset="415008">But, for the rest the state claims the whole of the bed saying that that bed as the bottom of a navigable water body inured to the state under the Equal Footing Doctrine at statehood and by virtue of its Organic Act and by confirmation in the Submerged Lands Act of 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.679" offset="516154">The United States, on the other hand, claims substantial portions of the same riverbed... perhaps, as much as a third of that riverbed.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.941" offset="549172">The federal claim is based on the opposite proposition that the river was not and is not navigable, and therefore did not inure to the state under the Equal Footing Doctrine or Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.327" offset="606746">The United States claims partly as riparian owner of the land immediately on the banks of the river, sometimes the mineral estates, sometimes the surface estates, sometimes both.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.756" offset="680516">Some of these are public lands reserved and retained by the United States since the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.626" offset="707997">Some of them are lands reacquired subsequently.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.125" offset="721999">In some cases, the United States claims the bed, but not the riparian land.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.358" offset="750942">That occurred because the state, which was graded like most states, Section 16 and 36, the school sections in its Organic Act, determined to reject the submerged portions of those sections and to condemnity lands elsewhere, thereby waiving its claim to the bed in those Sections 16 and 36.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.705" offset="852297">As the evidence of navigability in this case suggests... and we say it suggests the non-navigability of the river... it is not surprising that the state made no claim with respect to this bed for the better part of the first century since it was admitted to the state.</text>

            <text syncTime="205.883" offset="956996">How could they have made such a claim, Mr. Claiborne, before the enactment of the Quiet Title Act?</text>

            <text syncTime="210.617" offset="975909">I am saying they never asserted ownership, Justice Rehnquist, by leasing or by granting patents with respect to portions of the bed, or easements, or taking any other action which indicates their assertion of dominion with respect to that bed.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.952" offset="1049261">Indeed, so far as the record shows, North Dakota never asserted in any way any claim of ownership vis-a-vis the United States or vis-a-vis private landowners until at the earliest 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.337" offset="1114776">On the contrary, in 1955 when the Bureau of Land Management of the Department of the Interior specifically asked the State Attorney General whether in the State's view, the river was or had been at statehood navigable and accordingly appertained to the State, the express answer came back,</text>
            <text syncTime="266.235" offset="1198368">"No, this river has not and is not now navigable. "</text>
            <text syncTime="270.356" offset="1214877">Shortly, thereafter the United States began leasing portions of the bed, treating it as property of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.024" offset="1261584">There were some 39 such oil and gas leases by October, 1966, more than 12 years before this suit was filed, approximately 100 since that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.361" offset="1314874">In 1962, the United States began leasing competitively which required publication and notice, and we say, a further reason why the State should have been aware of the federal claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.151" offset="1374015">Now, apparently, in that same year, 1962, the State itself granted--</text>

            <text syncTime="320.352" offset="1414870">Now that is a whole different position than your statement that the State asserted no interest of its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.867" offset="1436918">What could the State have done before the enactment of the Quite Title Act, if it did become aware of the federal claim?</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis F. Claiborne</label>
            <text syncTime="383.638" offset="1668049">Justice Rehnquist, our record in this respect may be uneven, but my impression is that the United States has been rather receptive to overcoming the power of sovereign immunity by itself instituting an action to determine judicially a disputed land claim with states.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.475" offset="1755403">That has been the history of the Submerged Lands Act since the first California case through the more recent case involving the Atlantic Coast States, United States v. Maine.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.751" offset="1804513">All of those suits were those which could not have been brought by the state, but which the United States, though maintaining its ownership, determined it was only right and proper to have tested in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.870" offset="1852892">In this case, had that been the view of the United States, we would have instituted such a suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.867" offset="1884970">In our view, this claim is simply so lacking in merit, it does not justify such an action.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.489" offset="1911406">In all events, they were rather indications of the state's disclaimer of ownership after notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.141" offset="1950067">But I will not burden the Court with those details.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.892" offset="1965009">That is not what this Court is asked to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.047" offset="1977652">There is a question that undecided whether sufficient notice was given by the courts below, and if our position prevails the case would have to be returned to the District Court for a determination... a finding on that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.742" offset="2040451">At all events, in 1978 the State filed suit asserting its title to the bed and seeking to enjoin the federal officials from, in their words, asserting ownership through the granting of leases and other activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.082" offset="2105757">The question is whether that suit was filed too late.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.923" offset="2129163">Now, although the State sued the Secretary of Agriculture and the Chief of the Forest Service and the Secretary of the Interior, and the Director of the Bureau of Land Management, we asserted in defense to the State's suit that this was in reality a suit against the United States to quiet title to land in which the United States claimed an interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.491" offset="2215471">And, accordingly a suit governed by the federal Quiet Title Act, Section 2409a of the Judicial Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.472" offset="2251311">The District Court agreed and required the State to amend its complaint to allege that jurisdictional basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.360" offset="2282867">At this point, the question before the Court was whether the limitations provision of the Quiet Title Act applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.777" offset="2320588">Now, that limitations provision, which is set out in our brief at page 3, is subsection (f) of 2409a.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.913" offset="2357159">And, it provides as follows: "Any civil action"... I stress the word "any"...</text>
            <text syncTime="562.566" offset="2383700">"under this section shall be barred unless it is commenced within twelve years of the date upon which it accrued. "</text>
            <text syncTime="570.159" offset="2414106">"Such action shall be deemed to have accrued on the date the plaintiff or his predecessor in interest knew or should have known of the claim of the United States. "</text>

            <text syncTime="585.059" offset="2473665">What would be the effect as of the date the thing came into effect in 1972 of a claim, say, by a state or by anybody else against the government, which had, say, accrued in 1952?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="louis_f_claiborne" startTime="598.442" stopTime="870.956">
            <label>Mr. Louis F. Claiborne</label>
            <text syncTime="598.442" offset="2527269">Such a claim would be barred because while as originally proposed there was a grandfather clause allowing stale claims to be filed within a short period.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.330" offset="2578782">Ultimately the Congress agreed with the suggestion of the federal representatives that that would open the doors to too many claims and that rather than have a six-year period it would reach back twelve years.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.480" offset="2639386">But, there would be no grandfather clause for claims more stale than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.211" offset="2662270">Now, assuming that statute and that limitations provision of the statute applied, the second question was whether the State knew or should have known of the federal claim more than 12 years before the suit was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.016" offset="2717545">The State's stance in the District Court and ever since was that the limitations provision was inapplicable and that the State accordingly should focus its attention on the issue of navigability.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.729" offset="2776372">The United States, on the other hand, focused on the threshold question, the jurisdictional question, the limitations question, and produced evidence with respect to State knowledge of the federal claim more than 12 years before the suit was filed and argued that accordingly the action should be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.096" offset="2857874">The District Court agreed with the State holding that the limitations provision was inapplicable under these circumstances and, therefore, made no finding with respect to whether the State had knowledge, actual or constructive, 12 years before the suit was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.324" offset="2926733">And reaching the merits, the District Court found that the river was, indeed, navigable, and accordingly that the State had ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.822" offset="2968738">On appeal the Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit agreed with the District Court on both points, and accordingly affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.738" offset="3016385">We petitioned in this Court solely on the limitations point, not because we concede the navigability of the river, but because we felt that it was inappropriate to burden this Court with a purely fact-bound question of the navigability of this particular river.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.119" offset="3093917">We argued in all courts, including in this Court, that the courts should not have reached the issue of navigability because they had no jurisdiction, the action having been barred by limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.268" offset="3154521">Our argument is entirely straightforward.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.064" offset="3173747">We say this is an action which is in effect a suit to divest the United States of lands which it claims to own, which is barred by sovereign immunity except only as Congress has waived that bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.510" offset="3247517">We say this principle applies to states as well as private citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.350" offset="3274893">We note that in 1972 Congress did waive sovereign immunity in the Quiet Title Act, Section 2409a, in respect of this class of suit, but it did so on express conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.752" offset="3336438">And, one of those conditions, subsection (f) of the statute, is that the suit be filed within 12 years after knowledge, actual or constructive, of the federal claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.496" offset="3395474">Now, since as the District Court held and the Court of Appeals assumed, rightly, we think, North Dakota must invoke this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.725" offset="3436330">It must, like any other plaintiff, invoking the benefits of the statute also be bound by the conditions, including the limitations provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.627" offset="3480007">We see no basis for creating a special exception because North Dakota's claim of title here is constitutionally derived in the sense that the Equal Footing Doctrine is responsible for the State's alleged ownership of the riverbed.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.401" offset="3571017">Constitutional rights, like any others, can be barred by the failure to assert them within a given time.</text>

            <text syncTime="905.162" offset="3754083">Alternatively, we say that even if that were not true, since 1972 Congress has provided a leachant procedure for the assertion of such claims by states of others and that the state has failed to comply with the conditions of that limited procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="937.727" offset="3884382">I think that is so.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.179" offset="3894204">Though, if we had a different situation in which the United States for the first time seemed to be taking the State's sovereign lands, even after 1972, the State would have the option of either suing us under the Quiet Title Act or suing us... put claims under the Tucker Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.622" offset="3991902">And, indeed, one of the novelties of this case is that the Quiet Title Act provides that if the United States wishes to keep the property, notwithstanding the judgment is going against it, it may do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.852" offset="4044879">And, to that extent the injunction entered by the District Court is in any event improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.394" offset="4075076">Now, as I say, constitutional rights, like any other rights, can be barred by the failure to assert them timely.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.392" offset="4107050">The classical example being rights under the Just Compensation Clause which this Court and other courts have held are barred if not filed within six years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.903" offset="4153025">States are subject to limitations, witness this Court's venerable decision in Louisiana v. United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.072" offset="4185731">State land claims can be barred altogether by the sovereign immunity of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.460" offset="4223347">That is true with respect to trust lands that have been granted to the states in its Organic Act as a number of decisions of this Court indicate, and as the most recent decision of this Court bearing on the subject, California v. Arizona indicates that is true even with respect to the Equal Footing Doctrine lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.776" offset="4320523">In California v. Arizona the Court said explicitly, this suit would be barred but for the Quiet Title Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.865" offset="4360960">And the Court then construed the Quiet Title Act as waiving sovereign immunity, not merely in the district courts but also in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.802" offset="4396696">A holding wholly unnecessary if such a claim was in no event stopped by sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.594" offset="4435879">Now, of course, Congress cannot take away what the Constitution has given.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.249" offset="4458449">Congress cannot take away what Congress itself has given irrevocably.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.650" offset="4480079">But there is no taking here in that sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.039" offset="4497633">Congress' failure to lift the bar of sovereign immunity is not a taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.195" offset="4518217">Much less does a limitations provision, condition of such suit, amount to a taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.207" offset="4554266">Rights without a remedy may be rare in the law, but sovereign immunity is a classic example of such rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.560" offset="4595749">All sovereigns, including the State of North Dakota, invoke that Doctrine from time to time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.464" offset="4619363">Here we do not have a right without any remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.073" offset="4637754">We simply have a limited remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.212" offset="4650292">As I have said, the United States by and large has been receptive to paving the way to the judicial resolution of state claims, which were otherwise barred by sovereign immunity, by itself instituting the law suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.128" offset="4718002">But there is a limit to all good deeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.797" offset="4732630">Here the United States determined not to file its own action, at least not yet, and that is the essence of sovereign immunity, the prerogative not to waive the prerogative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.059" offset="4789682">Now, the practical importance of this question is substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.976" offset="4809326">If anything needs security, it is land titles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.175" offset="4842136">If the State were free after adequate notice and almost a century of default to reopen claims to water bottoms on the ground that at statehood the river was navigable, there would be a spate of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.169" offset="4914129">Indeed, judging from the amicus briefs in this case, filed by some 30 states, there are that many states ready, eager to file stale claims against the United States with respect to submerged lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.583" offset="4983824">They say, potentially 50 million acres are at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.723" offset="5004304">That seems to us a strong argument for holding the line against claims that are so stale that after notice they have not been filed for 12 years or more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.293" offset="5078596">For these reasons, we urge the Court to reverse the courts below insofar as they held the limitations provision of the Quiet Title Act inapplicable, to vacate the declaratory judgment with respect to navigability on the ground that the courts had no jurisdiction to reach that issue, and to remand the case to the District Court so as to have it enter a finding with respect to whether or not North Dakota had the requisite notice of the federal claim more than 12 years before it filed this action.</text>

            <text syncTime="1295.315" offset="5314743">We have a couple of things that the Petitioners have not in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.047" offset="5329685">First of all, we have evidence of navigability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.671" offset="5340134">Second of all, we have the decision of the District Court and the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals finding that the Little Missour River is navigable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.812" offset="5368660">Navigability is a threshold question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.996" offset="5377437">Without navigability, the State of North Dakota is out of court, period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.919" offset="5393110">It is interesting also to note that, of course, when we review the evidence, Brother Claiborne failed to note, that the Corps of Engineers in 1975, which is Exhibit A in the trial transcript, had a study that concluded that the Little Missour River was navigable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.583" offset="5455804">There is plenty of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.693" offset="5460193">The characterization of Baptiste who came down the river in 1804, who did in fact make it in a canoe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.738" offset="5484434">Teddy Roosevelt in March of 1886 pursued bandits down the Little Missour River in a boat that he had constructed for that particular purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.031" offset="5521633">He caught them, and took them to jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.856" offset="5528843">We want from the government a fair deal, a square deal, as Teddy Roosevelt would have given us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.278" offset="5554547">And, that is what we have gotten in the two lower courts in this particular case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2097.771" offset="8524565">Now, these are cases that follow up on, I think, the Lee, Larson and Malone line of cases with respect to the ability of a claimant to bring a claim against an official, notwithstanding whether or not there is a particular statutory remedy available.</text>

            <text syncTime="2250.803" offset="9136666">One other point that I would just briefly like to address is the so-called floodgates argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.569" offset="9243768">Brother Claiborne mentions that somehow by affirming this decision we are going to open the doors to a whole host of litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2287.677" offset="9284206">Perhaps, just exactly the converse may be true, that if we do not affirm this decision there will be a whole host of states scrambling right now trying to identify any conceivable claim that could be made by Petitioners or like people in the federal government, and there would be a whole host of lawsuits filed under the Quiet Title Act trying to beat the co-called 12-year statute of limitations that may very well run as to many of these people in 1984.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.792" offset="9388591">I think that a denial, a reversal of this claim, in fact, would increase litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.383" offset="9410952">There is no sense promoting litigation when, in fact, over the years federal officials and state officials are getting along reasonably well with respect to a particular piece of ground.</text>

            <text syncTime="2334.253" offset="9470511">And, I think the floodgates argument simply is erroneous in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.295" offset="9490678">In conclusion, I would simply like to note that the State of North Dakata and the 29 amicus states respectfully requests that this Court recognize a state's right to protect title to sovereign lands against federal officials and/or the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.383" offset="9555043">Such a decision would be in accord with over 150 years of case law history recognizing the constitutional Equal Footing Doctrine and in accord with the Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.035" offset="9601646">As to that Submerged Lands Act, I would simply note that in 1953 the Congress of the United States clearly expressed the intent and the will of Congress that submerged lands... that is the beds navigable rivers... belonged to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.199" offset="9666221">It was a specific direction to keep the federal government's hands off them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.341" offset="9682834">And, insofar as the Little Missouri River is a navigable river, then in accordance with the intent of the Congress, the federal officials in this case ought not interfere with our ownership of the bed of the Little Missouri River.</text>

            <text syncTime="2408.113" offset="9765904">First, Justice Stevens gave a better answer in his question to Justice Rehnquist than I did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.154" offset="9798087">When Justice Rehnquist said what could the State have done if it claimed the bed of this river before 1978?</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.213" offset="9842286">One answer is it could have sued the private landowners who enjoyed no sovereign immunity and who, I assume, having two-thirds of the river, were likewise granting leases or otherwise exerting ownership over what they thought was their portion of the riverbed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.082" offset="9909786">No such suit has, to this date, been filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.784" offset="9928594">Now, addressing Justice White's query with respect to the alternative basis for affirmance urged by North Dakota, it is fair to remind the Court that North Dakota filed a conditional cross petition of certiorari as to which the Court has taken no action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.760" offset="9996513">Although, we oppose that cross petition on reconsideration in our brief, we urge the Court to consider the issue raised there if that issue is not otherwise available as an alternative ground for affirmance, because it seems to us wasteful and, indeed, perhaps only an advisory opinion if this Court were to hold that if Quiet Title Act applies certain results follow without first deciding whether it is the necessary predicate for this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.547" offset="10119602">We have addressed in our brief the question whether this is a suit within the exception of Bowdoin and Malone and the Larson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.824" offset="10164741">That is discussed at pages 17 to 24 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.790" offset="10188670">We conclude, and I do not have the time to recite it here, that this is not one of those exceptional cases in which one may sue the officer rather than the sovereign on the ground that the officer is acting unconstitutionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.346" offset="10246870">This is not an officer straying on a frolic of his own.</text>

            <text syncTime="2644.981" offset="10713417">But, Your Honor is right that there is a technical defect in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.821" offset="10732748">In all events, at page 29 and the following pages of our brief we address this alternative point that from 1972 onward Congress determined that all such suits, whether or not they would previously lie against the officer, should now be filed under the following conditions... the limitations provision is not the only condition... against the United States itself, and we see in that enactment no preservation of any previous alternative, but, on the contrary, a regular arising of a now unique procedure which is more satisfactory than all the skirmishing that had gone before about whether this was properly a suit against the officer or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.225" offset="10926368">And, on that alternative ground, we urge reversal of the judgment of the Court of Appeals as well.</text>
