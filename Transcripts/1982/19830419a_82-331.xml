            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="150539">We will hear arguments first this morning in New Mexico, et al against the Mescalero Apache Tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.995" offset="190454">Mr. Dunnigan, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_l_dunigan" startTime="15.337" stopTime="213.610">
            <label>Mr. Thomas L. Dunigan</label>
            <text syncTime="15.337" offset="211875">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.926" offset="238206">The issue in this case plainly stated is simply does the State of New Mexico have the authority concurrent with the Mescalero Apache Tribe to regulate hunting and fishing by non-Indians on the Mescalero Apache reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.640" offset="297034">The history suggests that it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.809" offset="313752">Since New Mexico became a state in 1912, it has had fish and game laws in a state-wide wildlife conservation program.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.745" offset="353458">It has applied its game and fish laws to non-Indians hunting and fishing within all areas of the state during this period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.944" offset="390239">For approximately the last 15 years since the Mescalero Apache Tribe has allowed public hunting on its reservation, the State of New Mexico has applied its game and fish laws to non-Indians who have hunted or fished on that reservation as it has with respect to each of the other 26 Indian reservations or enclaves located in the State of New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.761" offset="497550">During this period of time the state has not only enforced its wildlife regulations, but the wildlife on Indian lands has benefitted from the full range of conservation programming that the state has provided over time on a state-wide basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.987" offset="562438">In 1977, however, the Mescalero Apache Tribe passed a hunting and fishing ordinance which specified in part that a state hunting and fishing license would no longer be required of any person hunting or fishing on the Mescalero Apache reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.621" offset="620952">Up until that time the Mescalero Tribe had acknowledged in its hunting and fishing brochures that state game and fish licensing regulations and the entire state game and fish wildlife regulation did apply to non-Indians hunting or fishing on the Mescalero Apache reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.020" offset="710604">The passage of the new ordinance in 1977 followed soon after the opening by the tribe of the Inn of the Mountain Gods on the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.858" offset="749892">The Inn of the Mountain Gods is a deluxe tourist resort featuring a hotel, a lake for fishing, boating and water sports, a golf course, tennis facilities, shooting range, a stable, and various other tourist and convention-related recrecational facilities and activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.847" offset="829827">The Inn was opened by the Mescalero Apache Tribe as part of a tourism program organized by the tribe and intended to attract non-Indians onto the reservation and to the Sierra Blanca ski resort, which is a tribal commercial enterprise located adjacent to the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.715" offset="909344">In connection with the opening of the Inn of the Mountain Gods, the Mescalero Apache Tribe also expanded its hunting and fishing business to include big game animal hunts known as package hunts.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.192" offset="971306">Package hunts include hunting fees, lodging at the Inn of the Mountain Gods, guide service and various other hunter needs.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="213.610" offset="1004952">Well, would it make any difference, Mr. Dunnigan, how much of the activity the Mescaleros were engaged in, whether it was one resort or a great many, a small amount or a great deal of this hunting?</text>

            <text syncTime="244.835" offset="1129817">Well, Your Honor, the logging operations were conducted by non-Indian companies together with Indian enterprises.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas L. Dunigan</label>
            <text syncTime="265.654" offset="1213096">Yes, Your Honor, I presume that is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.479" offset="1220410">In that respect there is no difference between the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.557" offset="1240681">There is a difference, though, in terms of the federal regulatory scheme that applied in that case, in the White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker case to which you refer as opposed to the one that applies in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.675" offset="1301181">For that reason, the cases are distinguishable, not because there is a difference in the commercial enterprise at stake.</text>

          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="297.045" stopTime="303.514">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="297.045" offset="1338692">Mr. Dunnigan.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_l_dunigan" startTime="303.514" stopTime="304.668">
            <label>Mr. Thomas L. Dunigan</label>
            <text syncTime="303.514" offset="1364501">Yes, Your Honor.</text>

          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="304.668" stopTime="349.056">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="304.668" offset="1369203">The Court in Montana v. United States, of course, recognized that an Indian tribe can prohibit non-members from hunting and fishing on the reservation or can allow them and condition that permit as the tribe determines.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.630" offset="1449034">Now how do you reconcile what New Mexico is asking for here with that case because it would seem that if the tribe has a right to condition the hunting and fishing as described in Montana, that the right would be meaningless if a state were allowed to apply inconsistent regulations.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_l_dunigan" startTime="349.056" stopTime="399.084">
            <label>Mr. Thomas L. Dunigan</label>
            <text syncTime="349.056" offset="1546732">Your Honor, I recognize that the Montana case articulates the principles you have described, and we do not argue that the Mescalero Apache Tribe does not have the right to admit hunters or fisherman if it desires or preclude hunting and fishing if it desires.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.048" offset="1638683">It can also establish terms and conditions for hunting and fishing if it so decides.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.779" offset="1665641">The Montana case certainly permits that.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.417" offset="1680165">But the Montana case did not suggest that when a tribe enjoys this authority over non-Indian visitors on its reservation, that that authority is exclusive of state authority which normally applies to non-Indians.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="399.084" stopTime="419.762">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="399.084" offset="1746830">But they could be totally inconsistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.803" offset="1753726">For instance, I do not know what the circumstances are here, but a tribe might develop the game to such an extent that it can offer people a chance to take five elk whereas the New Mexico requirements might permit someone to take only one, and the two would be quite inconsistent.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_l_dunigan" startTime="419.762" stopTime="544.945">
            <label>Mr. Thomas L. Dunigan</label>
            <text syncTime="419.762" offset="1829586">Your Honor, you suggest an extreme case, which is not a part of the factual situation here, but I acknowledge that, built in to a system of concurrent jurisdiction is the possibility of conflicts arising between the two sets of laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.833" offset="1909834">Our position is that the State of New Mexico as a sovereign continues to have the authority to apply its laws to non-Indians who are not immune from those laws as Indians are and that a reservation does not provide that immunity to a non-Indian unless that non-Indian can claim that he, too, is excused from obeying state law because there is a federal law that preempts those state laws that he has to abide by instead, or that his relationship with the tribe concerns a matter of the internal governmental relations of the tribe and for that reason tribal law alone controls.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.677" offset="2065210">But under normal circumstances as the cases that this Court has decided suggests that the normal circumstance is concurrent jurisdiction in those situations when a tribe does enjoy jurisdiction over non-Indians, which is not always the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.604" offset="2140861">The importance of the Montana case to this case, in fact, is the statement in that case that as a general proposition, and those are the words of this Court, as a general proposition the inherent sovereign authority of an Indian tribe does not extend to non-Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.988" offset="2222467">That is the normal proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.613" offset="2228946">The Court did articulate and identify circumstances in which an Indian tribe may regulate activities of non-members.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.813" offset="2265726">In fact, the Court said that a tribe may regulate through taxation, licensing and other means the activities of non-members who enter into consensual relationships with the tribe through commercial dealings, contracts, leases, and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.618" offset="2316926">And that may very well be the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.430" offset="2328211">But--</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="544.945" offset="2330301">Mr. Dunnigan, perhaps I am mistaken, but I thought the record does disclose conflicts between the state system and the tribal system particularly as to the taking of deer, that does may not be taken under the state regulations, but under the tribal ones a buck and a doe could be taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.077" offset="2430820">Am I mistaken?</text>

            <text syncTime="572.733" offset="2441373">So we do have some very definite conflicts as Justice O'Connor indicated?</text>

            <text syncTime="578.979" offset="2466451">We do not have the particular one that Justice O'Connor identified or any one quite that dramatic, but we do have conflicts in the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.991" offset="2522457">There is no question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.176" offset="2527159">If we had not, perhaps this case would not have arisen.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.769" offset="2537608">But I am not suggesting, Your Honor, and I did not mean to leave the impression that there are no conflicts in those laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.236" offset="2559447">We recognize that and we recognize the potential for others.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.937" offset="2574284">What we are saying, however, is that the state nevertheless enjoys the right it has as a sovereign to apply its laws to non-members of an Indian tribe unless, again, those laws under the decisions of this Court have been preempted by a federal regulatory scheme or that the sovereign powers of the tribe with reference to the governing of its own members and their internal affairs would be disrupted and frustrated in a given instance.</text>

            <text syncTime="941.989" offset="3918441">This case was here once before pursuant to a petition for certiorari which the state filed after the original decision of the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.248" offset="3959506">On its first visit this Court summarily remanded the case to the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.622" offset="3988972">This Court vacated the judgment of the Tenth Circuit, remanded the case for reconsideration in light of this Court's decision in the Montana case.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.962" offset="4026379">On remand, however, the Tenth Circuit simply reinstated its original decision and dismissed this Court's decision in the Montana case as essentially irrelevant to a decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.813" offset="4097746">And the Tenth Circuit sought to explain its decision in that regard by suggesting that the Montana case involved non-Indian fee lands within the Crow reservation and the question of whether a tribe, being the Crow tribe in that case, could impose or regulate non-Indian hunting and fishing on those non-Indian fee lands whereas this case involves tribal trust lands within a reservation and the authority of a state to regulate non-Indian hunting and fishing within those tribal trust lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.627" offset="4232955">Now, these differences, of course, do, in fact, exist between these two cases, but that much was evident when this Court originally remanded this case back to the Tenth Circuit in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.028" offset="4286559">So despite these factual differences, the Montana case remains crucial to this case because of one of its underlying principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.338" offset="4319891">The Montana case, as I indicated earlier, stated, as had this Court in Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe and Wheeler v. United States, that as a general proposition the inherent authority of a tribe does not extend to non-Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.941" offset="4382271">The basis of the Montana case was not that non-Indian fee lands were involved but that non-Indians were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.281" offset="4407662">The Court did not say that tribal laws do not apply on non-Indian fee lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.468" offset="4424381">It said that tribal laws do not apply to non-Indians as a general rule regardless of whether--</text>

            <text syncTime="1109.343" offset="4587907">It does not regulate the conduct of a person on the reservation in terms of his hunting and fishing activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.573" offset="4624792">It does not recognize, Your Honor, as you suggest that the tribe has the authority to impose regulations that would oust state law if that was the Justice's suggest.</text>

            <text syncTime="1152.730" offset="4761360">That language is absent from this hunting and fishing statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1157.573" offset="4780795">That is correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.977" offset="4786438">The penalty imposed by that statute does not require that a state law be violated before it is implemented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.752" offset="4845475">But again it is only a criminal trespass statute as the legislative history clearly suggests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.782" offset="4865641">It does not punish anything other than entry without permission, and for that reason it does not provide the comprehensive regulatory scheme with regard to hunting and fishing that was apparent or present in the Bracker case with reference to the logging and timber operations involved in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.410" offset="4984132">The problem with the original decision of the Tenth Circuit in this particular case was that it failed to recognize, either in its original decision or on remand, the general proposition which this Court stated in Montana that non-Indians are normally not subject to tribal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.308" offset="5083711">In fact, it inverted that principle and started at the threshold with the observation that in the area of game and fish regulation the inherent sovereign powers of a tribe extend to non-members and they are exclusive, in the judgment of the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.801" offset="5157690">In that regard, the Tenth Circuit has fashioned essentially a new rule of law which has no judicial authority to support it whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.783" offset="5189664">It is certainly squarely in conflict with this Court's judgment in the Montana case as well as many other cases in this Court, one, for example, being Washington v. Fishing Vessels Association which clearly held that an Indian tribe does not have complete dominion over the taking of any species even though it may have a treaty right to hunt and fish free of state regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.912" offset="5298124">So we have here a situation in which the Tenth Circuit has adopted a position in this case which is virtually synonymous with the position advocated by the Solicitor General in Bracker and in the Ramah Navajo case but rejected by this Court to the effect that on-reservation activities affecting a resident tribe should be considered presumptively beyond the reach of state law by operation of the principle of tribal sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.460" offset="5412332">So that in that situation a state would have to establish its jurisdiction over non-Indians by pointing to a specific congressional delegation of authority to exercise its power, or it would have to show an essential need to regulate in support of a vital state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.123" offset="5498954">But this Court said no to that proposition in Bracker and in Ramah and it should say no to the Tenth Circuit's formulation of the same principle in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.510" offset="5532495">As we discussed earlier, the Montana case did recognize that there are situations in which tribal ordinances may be applied to Indians, but in those situations as a general proposition state law remains concurrent with tribal law unless again there has been a federal regulatory scheme based upon congressional legislation and implementing regulations which preempt state law and that requires an examination of the particular context to determine if there is such legislation, if there are such regulations and then a particularized inquiry into the nature of the state, federal, and tribal interests is initiated to determine whether or not in the specific context of a particular case the exercise of state authority would violate that particular regulatory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.380" offset="5759969">In this case, the Tenth Circuit did embark upon that inquiry eventually, choosing not to rest its decision entirely on its novel formulation respecting the exclusive tribal sovereignty over non-Indians where wildlife is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.264" offset="5831545">But the inquiries it made were so distorted by the threshold view that it had adopted that its inquiries really cannot withstand critical examination in light of the authorities articulated by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.083" offset="5894866">For example, in conducting its inquiry with regard to preemption, the Tenth Circuit noted that when a state asserts authority over the conduct of non-Indians what is called for is a particularized inquiry into the nature of the various state, federal, and tribal interests at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.796" offset="5973651">What the court below failed to recognize, however, is that before one engages in a particularized inquiry into the nature of the interests at stake, there must be a point of departure, a frame of reference, a context in which to conduct that inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.931" offset="6030180">And that context is the existence of a congressional enactment or set of laws and a set of implementing regulations which establish a comprehensive and pervasive scheme of federal regulation over the activity in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.611" offset="6084932">As this Court said in the Ramah case, it is federal law reflecting the various federal and tribal interests which must be found in order for state law to be preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.655" offset="6137073">One does not simply view the interests at stake, add them up, or weigh them in the abstract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.134" offset="6159016">On the contrary, unless there is federal legislation and implementing regulations, there is no question at all of preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.976" offset="6190363">For example, in the White Mountain case this Court considered whether or not the State of Arizona may impose certain taxes on non-Indian logging and timber companies, as we have previously described.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.595" offset="6248877">In finding these laws preemptive, this Court said that in that situation the federal government's regulation of the harvesting of Indian timber is comprehensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.451" offset="6292240">In the words of the Court, that regulation takes the form of acts of Congress, detailed regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Interior, and day-to-day supervision by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.601" offset="6344903">In the Ramah case similarly, for example, this Court declared New Mexico's gross receipts tax as applied to a non-Indian construction company building a school for Indian school children on the reservation to be preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.939" offset="6402268">But in that case the Court pointed to the Indian Self-Determination in Education Assistance Act, the Indian Financing Act of 1974 and the regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Interior thereunder, which among other things gave the BIA wide-ranging authority to monitor the entire construction program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.132" offset="6478963">In that context, this Court found that the imposition of additional state burdens on that federal regulatory scheme would not be permissible, the state interest being simply raising revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.704" offset="6537269">But again the preemption analysis begins with an examination of the context in which it arises to determine if there are congressional enactments, laws of the United States, and regulations of the executive branch which establish a federal regulatory scheme with respect to which the state is not permitted to intrude.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.464" offset="6624309">Short of that, there is no question of preemption, and state laws prevail with respect to non-Indians on Indian land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.006" offset="6654506">With reference to the question of infringement in this case, it is based really upon two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.174" offset="6707169">One being the possible financial impairment to the tribe's revenues as a result of the application of state laws and the claim that implementation of state regulation over non-Indians would create conflicts in the dual regulatory schemes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.980" offset="6786372">As we have indicated, that conflict alone as this Court has indicated in the Coville cigarette tax cases is not a basis for a determination of infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.287" offset="6827646">With reference to the claim of financial impairment, factually that has not happened in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.643" offset="6849066">In fact, revenue levels have increased both with respect to the hunting and fishing business of the tribe and with respect to the operation of the hunting and fishing program itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.841" offset="6897863">If the Court please, I would like to reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1852.181" offset="7559179">Back in 1966 we, in fact, had 13 elk in the vicinity of the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.586" offset="7580808">It was because of tribal activity that we subsequently imported in 1966-67 about 162 elk from Wyoming, and it is true that the State of New Mexico gave us a permit to import those elk into the state.</text>

            <text syncTime="1910.766" offset="7793550">Quite obviously, significant range development has occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.249" offset="7807447">We have not reduced the herd of the tribe during the intervening period, and that is an economic decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.731" offset="7833360">That is forebearance on the part of the tribe in raising cattle on the reservation in order to develop this herd of elk for other purposes to supplement as an economic enterprise on the reservation a total tourism development program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.050" offset="7906712">Incidentally, the State of New Mexico in this case benefits from the activities of the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.905" offset="7934088">The elks, we cannot keep all of them on the reservation as much as we would like to, and in fact the hunting has been enhanced in the immediate vicinity of the reservation to the benefit of non-Indian hunters who hunt off of the reservation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2962.604" offset="12000936">Mr. Chief Justice, certainly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.462" offset="12012325">We approach the case on three different bases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.910" offset="12034163">The first as we read the injunction of this Court in the White Mountain Apache case, the test this Court has laid down in judging whether the activity of non-Indians within an Indian reservation is or is not exempted from state law depends on a weighing of the respective interests of the federal government, the state government, and the Indian government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.098" offset="12150879">We have engaged in our brief in that weighing here and find that what is conspicuously lacking is any serious claim of state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.234" offset="12199466">There is no allegation that there is a need for state intervention to preserve the species or any other conservation purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.498" offset="12236456">There is a concession that the tribal activity and the way in which the program is managed is sound and creates no off-reservation harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.740" offset="12281491">The only interest which the state asserts is one to manage the wildlife of the entire state in a unit, but that interest is one which cannot prevail for if the tribe, as it is plainly free to do, were to close the reservation to non-Indians and manage the resources for its own benefit, clearly state regulation would not be applicable there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.200" offset="12403326">We cannot appreciate why that management of the same fish and game on the same lands should be a greater interest to the state merely because the hunting and fishing is done by non-Indians rather than by Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.708" offset="12473334">Now, so much for our initial approach to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.314" offset="12491724">We do assert what this Court has labeled the two independent barriers to state jurisdiction within an Indian reservation, they being an infringement on the right of tribal self-government or tribal sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.838" offset="12553791">Here we see, particularly with respect to game management, a native resource, a special tribal claim to assert its jurisdiction within what are tribal lands in its territory, the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.486" offset="12636443">That interest here is conspicuous because the tribe itself as a government has determined to exploit its resource, to manage it for conservation purposes, but also for the generation of revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.276" offset="12715541">It has developed a comprehensive, and the state concedes, a wholly satisfactory scheme, one which involves the tribal government, employs tribal members, and generates important income for governmental tribal purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.504" offset="12792550">Hence, the claim of any infringement with that scheme is a serious one in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.781" offset="12829644">We also look to the preemption analysis which this Court has traditionally found to be an independent barrier to state regulation and taxation within a reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.418" offset="12876142">Here, to be sure, we do not have the pervasive federal scheme that was present in White Mountain, but we do have a very clear congressional indication, both in 1165 in the exemptions of Public Law 280 in the treaty with the Mescalero and elsewhere of an indication by Congress that the management of wildlife within a reservation is a matter to be left to the tribal authority for the most part.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.432" offset="13024204">And here we have no vacuum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.665" offset="13037161">We have the tribe taking up the invitation which Congress has given and developing in a, as I say, satisfactory way a very comprehensive and very pervasive wildlife management scheme which is partly conservationist and partly a business venture.</text>

            <text syncTime="3276.830" offset="13257843">What is more, the BIA and other federal agencies have very importantly collaborated in the beginning of this venture and continue to provide on a daily basis assistance, expertise, and help in overseeing and approving annually the ordinances of the tribe and its program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.569" offset="13364737">So there is that assurance in the supervision of the Department of Interior that the tribe, as New Mexico concedes, are managing this venture and this game in a proper way.</text>

            <text syncTime="3672.545" offset="14840655">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3675.543" offset="14852671">With reference to Justice Powell's inquiry, I should point out that there is no federal involvement whatsoever in the enforcement of tribal regulations in the area of hunting and fishing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3688.615" offset="14904916">Moreover, tribal regulations, tribal ordinances themselves even if they are comprehensive cannot by their own terms oust, or by their own force oust state law applicable to non-Indians, and this Court has so held in Washington v. the Confederated Tribes of the Coville Indian Reservation where the Court said, we are not going to adopt the far-reaching notion that an Indian tribe has the authority as the United States would have to preempt state law merely by enacting a legislative ordinance that pertains to the same conduct that state law purports to regulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3738.656" offset="15105119">If this were true, if a tribe were able to do this, then any Indian ordinance passed would... if a tribe were able to do this simply because the federal government does approve its ordinances, if that alone were enough to give it preemptive effect, then any Indian ordinance of any kind adopted by an Indian tribe applicable to non-Indians at least would be preemptive of any state law that applied to the same situation because as the Solicitor General noted, all Indian ordinances that apply to non-Indians have to be approved by the Secretary of the Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="3779.640" offset="15269063">If his imprimatur of that regulation is enough to give the Indian ordinance preemptive effect, then we have an open-ended situation that whenever an Indian tribe enacts any ordinance whatsoever state law is preempted.</text>
