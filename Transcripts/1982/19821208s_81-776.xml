            <text syncTime="12.521" offset="142364">This case is here on direct appeal from a three-judge District Court for the Southern District of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.124" offset="172770">The Court there held that certain campaign disclosure provisions of the Ohio Campaign Expense Reporting Law cannot be constitutionally apply to the Ohio Socialist Workers Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.219" offset="229090">The Ohio statute requires every political party to report the names and addresses of campaign contributors and recipients of campaign expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.145" offset="276842">The District Court concluded that if appellees were compelled to identify all contributors and recipients, those identified might be subject to public harassment and hostility.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.517" offset="334311">Accordingly, that Court enjoined the enforcement of the disclosure provisions against the appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.960" offset="364091">We hold that the Ohio statute cannot be constitutionally applied to the Socialist Workers Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.349" offset="393662">The First Amendment protects against to compel disclosure of political association and beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.551" offset="426471">In our view, a State may not compel a minor party to disclose the identities of campaign contributors, all recipients of campaign expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.883" offset="471820">If there is a reasonable probability that a disclosure will subject them -- subject those identified to threats, harassment, or reprisals, such a reasonable probability was demonstrated by the evidence of governmental and private hostility toward appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.834" offset="555621">Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.856" offset="571712">Justice Blackmun has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.079" offset="596581">Justice O'Connor joined by Justice Rehnquist and Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.</text>
