            <text syncTime="74.855" offset="449452">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case involves the constitutionality of the provisions of Ohio's Campaign Expense Reporting Act, which requires campaign committees to file reports setting forth various information concerning their receipt and expenditure of campaign funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.524" offset="620084">This case was initiated in 1974 by various Socialist Workers Party candidates and their campaign committees along with several unnamed persons who claimed to have made contributions to or received expenditures from those campaign committees.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.958" offset="681838">A temporary restraining order was entered soon after this case was filed, and it enjoined the application of the disclosure provisions of the Ohio law to the Socialist Workers Party candidates and their committees throughout the pendency of this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.922" offset="741710">The case was tried in February of 1981, and on June 25, 1981, a three-judge panel held that the disclosure provisions of Ohio Revised Code Sections 3517.10 and 3517.11 are unconstitutional as applied to the Socialist Workers Party and the class represented by the individual appellees in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.707" offset="848917">It is our position in this case that the district court erred in so holding because it misapplied the test established by this Court in Buckley versus Valeo, in 1976.</text>

            <text syncTime="245.538" offset="1132189">Specifically, and this is our primary point in this case, specifically, the evidence presented in the district court did not demonstrate a reasonable probability that the disclosure of the names of contributors to Socialist Worker Party candidates in Ohio and the disclosure of the names of persons receiving funds from SWP candidates' campaign committees would subject those contributors or recipients of expenditures to threats, harassment, or reprisals, which is what this Court said to look for in Buckley versus Valeo.</text>

            <text syncTime="306.651" offset="1376590">Now, you say that is not a factual finding.</text>

            <text syncTime="376.140" offset="1654638">Additionally, and this, Justice White, is the biggest problem we have with the evidence, additionally, the vast majority of the evidence introduced by the appellees in this case pertained to historical past activities of agencies of the federal government over which the State of Ohio has absolutely no control.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.664" offset="1732691">Moreover, the activities of these federal agencies took place irrespective of and in the absence of Ohio's campaign expense reporting law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1087.067" offset="4498327">There is a very important distinction there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.785" offset="4509194">One of the other things brought out in this Court's opinion in the Buckely case which we would like to address is the discussion of a minor party's impact on the election process in any given state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.839" offset="4565410">This Court said that a minor party's impact on elections... when it addressed that issue, it looked to whether or not minor parties were likely to win in any given election.</text>

            <text syncTime="1123.675" offset="4644718">It is more... the true question concerns a minor party's potential impact on the outcome of any given election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.925" offset="4673766">If it has that impact, it is more than just a mere minor party that appears on the ballot, has no impact, and goes away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.639" offset="4704590">In Ohio, for example, in the 1974 gubernatorial election, one of the plaintiffs in this case, Nancy Brown Laser, ran for governor in Ohio as the Socialist Worker Party candidates.</text>

            <text syncTime="1159.505" offset="4788078">Jim Rhodes beat the other candidate, the other major party candidate, John Gilligan, by 13,500 votes in Ohio's 1974 gubernatorial election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.640" offset="4836561">Obviously, Nancy Laser had a very important impact on the outcome of our gubernatorial election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.983" offset="4865922">If a mere 12 percent of the people who voted for this minority party candidate, 12 percent of the minority party candidate's votes, if those would have been switched to John Gilligan, he would have been governor instead of Jim Rhodes, who won by 13,500 votes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.208" offset="4930915">A minor party can have more impact on elections than just winning the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.270" offset="4951082">We think that is an important thing to take into consideration in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1646.900" offset="6737648">The three-judge court applied the law for the cases like this that this Court announced in 1976 in Buckley against Valeo, and found that under the First Amendment, the Socialist Workers Party campaigns in Ohio were exempt from the Ohio disclosure law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.690" offset="6808806">The three-judge court found on the totality of the circumstances that there was a reasonable probability that compelled disclosure of the contributors' names would lead to threats, reprisals, or harassment from either government officials or private parties.</text>

            <text syncTime="1703.860" offset="6965436">In the one-year period before trial, the record shows that 22 members of the Socialist Workers Party were fired because they belonged to the Socialist Workers Party.</text>

            <text syncTime="1721.057" offset="7034295">In Ohio, there were about 60 Socialist Workers Party members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.852" offset="7049446">If you translate that 7 percent into major party proportions, it means thousands of Democrats, thousands of Republicans would lose their jobs annually in Ohio on account of their political associations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1834.120" offset="7486527">Now, with respect to this most recent evidence, the state says that all it amounts to is isolated, unrelated incidents, as if these things were bolts out of the blue and took place in a vacuum.</text>

            <text syncTime="2990.673" offset="12112708">But the reason why it was delayed was because Buckley against Valeo was in the... was working its way up toward the Supreme Court, and there was then a lengthy battle with the FBI over discovery of the FBI records from Cleveland.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.495" offset="12179999">After those records were finally revealed in a highly excised form, we stopped fighting the FBI and took what they gave us in that excised form and moved forward fairly promptly toward trial.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gary Elson Brown</label>
            <text syncTime="3479.566" offset="14068339">Chief Justice, and if it please the Court, we just have a couple of brief points we would like to make on rebuttal in regard to two specific cases which have been previously decided in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.139" offset="14110553">One of them is the Paul Young case involving the Socialist Workers Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.342" offset="14127376">In that case, the Soclialist Workers Party lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.216" offset="14138869">The district court required the Socialist Workers Party to disclose the identity of its contributors and the recipients of its expenditures, yet in this case, the SWP has presented no evidence of any harassment in Oregon, despite the fact that they present extensive other evidence of nationwide problems in the evidence in their case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.549" offset="14224238">Again, I think they could have presented direct evidence on the question regarding potential harassment of contributors or expenditure recipients out of the Oregon situation if there had been any harassment, threats, or reprisals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.575" offset="14284319">The other case we would like to refer to briefly is the FEC versus Hall Tiner case, which Mr. Buckley just brought to the Court's attention in his letter this week.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.117" offset="14322458">That case involves the Communist Party rather than the Socialist Workers Party, but that case is a very telling case, because the evidence there showed, and incidentally, the Court created an exemption for the Communist Party in the FEC case, and the evidence in that case showed that there are numerous federal statutes currently subjecting members of the Communist Party to both civil disabilities and criminal liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.886" offset="14421619">Secondly, membership can cause a naturalized citizen to have his citizenship revoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.401" offset="14443666">The evidence also showed that in many states it is currently illegal to be a member of the communist party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.321" offset="14467281">Fourth, contributors to the Communist Party are proscribed by many state statutes throughout the country, and most importantly, there was evidence in the form of an affidavit by the Assistant Director of the FBI that even though the Cointelpro, the harassment program of the FBI, even though the Cointelpro Program was terminated in 1971, the Communist Party of the United States is currently under active surveillance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.375" offset="14575532">That is very distinguishable from this case, where the government has testified that there is no longer any Cointelpro Programs vis-a-vis the Socialist Workers Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.822" offset="14617328">They are not under active surveillance in this country.</text>

            <text syncTime="3621.119" offset="14634465">Mr. Brown, time-wise, where does the line of demarcation come?</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.894" offset="14665602">Suppose the FBI had announced last week that it was terminating?</text>

            <text syncTime="3642.094" offset="14718370">A three-judge panel or trial court or this Court has to bring its experience to bear on that question, but last week is a far cry, ten or eleven years ago, and the issue coming out of the Buckley versus Valeo test is the future reasonable probability that disclosure is going to result in threats, reprisals, or harassment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.961" offset="14801857">If it just ceased last week, I think that would be a different case than we have here, where it ceased eleven years ago.</text>

            <text syncTime="3711.891" offset="14997567">Your Honor, in closing, I think clearly in consideration of this matter, the district court incorrectly applied the standards set forth by this Court in Buckley versus Valeo by failing to require the Socialist Workers Party to properly establish that a reasonable probability in the future of threats, reprisals, or harassment to contributors or recipients of expenditures would result from their compliance with the disclosure requirements of our statute.</text>
