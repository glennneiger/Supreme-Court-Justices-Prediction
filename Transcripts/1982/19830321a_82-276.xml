            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="156297">We will hear arguments first this afternoon in Dirks against the Securities and Exchange Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.934" offset="192033">Mr. Bonderman, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_bonderman" startTime="11.602" stopTime="214.551">
            <label>Mr. David Bonderman</label>
            <text syncTime="11.602" offset="202690">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.274" offset="217319">Ten years ago today, in fact virtually at this hour, Petitioner Dirks was in the office of Stanley Goldblum, Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer of then high flying Equity Funding Corporation of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.016" offset="280326">Justice White, it was at 10:00 in the morning, California time.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.936" offset="296000">[Laughter]</text>
            <text syncTime="38.527" offset="310315">Mr. Dirks was there to confront Mr. Goldblum with uncorroborated allegations of a former officer... a fired former officer of a subsidiary to the effect in relevant part that the major foundations of the company, its life insurance subsidiary, were a fraud and that the company was carrying on its books substantial amounts of "phony policies" which were being sold to reinsurers as though they were real in a Ponzi scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.185" offset="460989">Mr. Goldblum, of course, denied all, arranged for a meeting which lasted much of the day with all of the other major officers of the company in an endeavor to persuade Mr. Dirks that these allegations were entirely spurious and were being circulated by a disgruntled former fired employee who, although Mr. Dirks hadn't mentioned his name, Mr. Goldblum knew who it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.268" offset="573316">Secrist had come to Dirks ten days earlier with these and other allegations, some of which ultimately proved to be true, some of which proved to be false.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.156" offset="608842">He had come to Dirks because Dirks had a reputation as an analyst who was willing to investigate beyond just looking at reports, the bottom line financial analysis, because as the Court of Appeal below found the Securities and Exchange Commission had a history of failing to act promptly in dealing with what has come to be known as the Equity Funding Scandal, the SEC having been informed by one of its own former attorneys a year and a half earlier and having taken essentially no action, a quick investigation which was closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.140" offset="744784">The SEC again being informed within two days of Mr. Dirks, but again concluding that there was nothing there and not taking any action at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.105" offset="780624">Secrist had the idea that in view of the performance by the regulators and in view of the notion within the company that the company had connections through its associate general counsel to the SEC, which made it clear that the SEC would never act, and through its vice president of the Illinois Insurance Commission, which also assured that the Insurance Commission which had regulatory authority would never act, the only way to public's eyes what Secrist believed, though, as he admitted he had no proof, was a major, perhaps the major fraud in corporate America at the time was to have somebody like Dirks go out, do such investigation as he could and to publicize those allegations in the only way a securities analyst can by telling everybody he can get his hands on with the result that the trading in the stock would cause an adjustment in the price--</text>

            <text syncTime="214.551" offset="1014472">Mr. Bonderman, we are dealing here, I guess, only with the activities of Mr. Dirks in those few days before he went to the SEC.</text>

            <text syncTime="229.701" offset="1075076">Why shouldn't he have gone in the first place to the SEC and then gone ahead and done all of the things that he did?</text>

            <text syncTime="235.713" offset="1099108">Well, there are two answers to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.558" offset="1106527">I would like to start with the second one if I might.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.278" offset="1113319">The second one is that the SEC's position is that even if he had he would have violated the law because it is no defense that you reported it to the SEC--</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="249.148" offset="1152816">Well, but I suppose you could argue to us that it should be a defense that he reported it to the SEC.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.210" offset="1173087">That is another question.</text>

            <text syncTime="255.520" offset="1178312">--That brings me to what I suppose, perhaps, should have been my first.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.518" offset="1190328">It was reported to Dirks by Mr. Secrist that the SEC was aware and had been informed in 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.311" offset="1225541">That was correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.559" offset="1230452">The Courts below so found--</text>

            <text syncTime="274.681" offset="1255007">You would acknowledge that at some point it is his obligation?</text>

            <label>Mr. David Bonderman</label>
            <text syncTime="279.369" offset="1273711">--Well, the answer to that is, I would say first, if he has an obligation to go to the SEC at all--</text>

            <text syncTime="289.098" offset="1312686">--I believe not, but I believe that that is not material here because under the facts present what he had was a rumor, an unverified allegation, perhaps more than a rumor, but certainly less than fact, of the sort that goes on in the market all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.420" offset="1381962">In fact, Stanley Sporkin, the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Division of Enforcement at the time, who was called before Congress and asked why was it that the SEC didn't take action when Dirks did go there on the 26th--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="319.476" stopTime="340.327">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="319.476" offset="1434103">Well, if you would assume for purposes of answering the question that his obligation as a licensee to be a broker/dealer does obligate him to go to the SEC with the information, then could you agree that he ought to go there first?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_bonderman" startTime="340.327" stopTime="396.694">
            <label>Mr. David Bonderman</label>
            <text syncTime="340.327" offset="1517590">--I think the answer to that is no because I believe that Mr. Dirks did, in fact, go to the SEC himself although Secrist told him on the 19th of March that Secrist had gone to the SEC... That turned out to be inaccurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.651" offset="1570880">Indirectly the information was brought to the SEC's attention on the 9th... I believe that the record here is clear that Mr. Dirks went to the SEC on the 26th at the very first time, certainly the very first working day, that he had anything beyond speculation allegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.798" offset="1647471">After he had checked it out, he and Mr. Blundell from The Wall Street Journal, who was, in fact, the first person that Mr. Dirks talked to, did, in fact, go to the SEC.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.496" offset="1686237">I might add that Mr. Dirks had a very personal additional reason for not going to the SEC because the last time he was involved in an investigation, he had done just what you suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.260" offset="1725316">Some clients of his... This involved a prior case, the ITT Hartford--</text>

            <text syncTime="398.133" offset="1748826">It is in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.241" offset="1753215">Mr. Dirks in that case had gone to the SEC because he heard from some of his clients that insider trading was going on, and he went to the SEC and told them requesting that they please keep his name out of it because his clients would not appreciate his sharing their confidences with the SEC.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.358" offset="1821655">The first thing the SEC did was call up the clients and said, Dirks here is alleging that you know thus and such about inside information and inside trading in the Hartford case.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.041" offset="1860421">Needless to say, Mr. Dirks himself was personally disencouraged because of that experience for going to the SEC before he believed he had facts, which he did not have, we believe.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="437.943" offset="1908068">But, I suppose, the SEC as affirmed by the Court of Appeals, though, found that the information he had during the days before he went to the SEC was material specific in detail?</text>

            <label>Mr. David Bonderman</label>
            <text syncTime="452.766" offset="1967314">Well, the answer to that is in part, yes, although what the Commission really found was at least and the Administrator alleges the same thing... at least, forgetting what happened earlier on, at least by the weekend between the 23rd and 26th he had such information.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.461" offset="2038054">In fact, the information that Dirks had was brought to the attention of Mr. Sporkin on a telephone call by Mr. Blundel of The Wall Street Journal on the evening of the 23rd of March which happened to have been a Friday.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.674" offset="2078909">Dirks came in and testified starting on the following Monday, the 26th, testified for three days at the end of which time Mr. Sporkin testified before Congress that the SEC had nothing but hearsay, innuendo and rumor, and nothing on which it could act.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.854" offset="2147664">That was the SEC's position and testimony before Congress about what Dirks knew.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.981" offset="2164173">That is after Dirks spent three days telling them.</text>

            <text syncTime="564.003" offset="2412232">So, the truth is that you are caught between a rock and a hard place in the sense that an analyst like Dirks has no access to the press.</text>

            <text syncTime="631.912" offset="2683905">Some of those... Five of those persons who sold were charged in this proceeding below, and they defended themselves, in part, on the grounds that they were caught with two fiduciary obligations, assuming for the moment that this was inside information, which I do not believe for a moment it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.280" offset="2737404">They had two fiduciary obligations.</text>

            <text syncTime="652.280" offset="2765407">They have an obligation to act for those trustees, and they have an obligation not to violate the law with respect to this information.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.900" offset="2799889">The Courts below, or this Commission because it never got to the Court below, held that whatever your other fiduciary obligations are, it gives you no license to violate these laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.584" offset="2846596">I think the question is an open one.</text>

            <text syncTime="678.816" offset="2871464">What happens here if we think about the public policy implications of what was done, and, indeed, why the Solicitor General and the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the criminal division filed a brief urging reversal, is that as one commentator put it, you have here the biggest boon for the successful commission and continuation of fraud that can be imagined because what you have done to somebody in Dirks' position is to tell him that the only thing he can do without risking a securities violation is to do what counsel suggested below, nothing.</text>

            <text syncTime="722.923" offset="3047948">What he did was tell everybody he could get his hands on, which included the auditors, which included The Wall Street Journal, which included a whole series of persons in the securities business, large and small, as the SEC found.</text>

            <text syncTime="873.378" offset="3649809">Nobody who is committing a fraud desires to have it circulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.248" offset="3669244">But, yet that is the foundation for the whole insider trading rules and regulations stemming from Investors Management, the notion of improper dissemination.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.025" offset="3716369">There was nothing improper about what Mr. Secrist chose to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.525" offset="3734341">He had two choices as a fiduciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.725" offset="3743118">The fraud was going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.101" offset="3748656">He could do either of two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.191" offset="3757015">He could, as the Commission suggests he should have, done nothing whatsoever and allowed it to continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.580" offset="3778540">Instead, he chose to follow a path which lead to its disclosure sooner rather than later.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.748" offset="3803200">And, that is because, and it is a proven fact in this case, so found by the Court of Appeals that reporting this information to public officials got nowhere in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.529" offset="3850325">That isn't and should not come to anybody as a shock, although this case is a little more egregious as to what it is that public officials overlooked because entire statutory enforcement schemes, indeed the whole reason we have a 10b-5, a private right of action at all, is a recognition that no matter how well motivated an intention and whatever skillful a job they are doing, regulators simply cannot probe and uncover all instances where enforcement is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.798" offset="3951471">That is why we have private enforcement, not only in 10b-5, in the anti-trust statutes, throughout the federal regime.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.278" offset="3977384">It is why we have informers' rewards.</text>

            <text syncTime="1623.912" offset="6651905">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.083" offset="6672594">Raymond Dirks was censured by the Commission for passing material, nonpublic information he had received from Equity Funding to five institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.312" offset="6721495">On the basis of that information, they sold more than $17,000,000 worth of Equity Funding securities to investors who did not know that those securities were virtually worthless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.525" offset="6770397">In imposing only a censure, the Commission took into account Mr. Dirks' role in bringing to light the massive fraud at Equity Funding as a result of his investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.784" offset="6811357">But while his role mitigated any sanction to be imposed upon him as a result of his unlawful tipping activities, it did not excuse them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1679.294" offset="6873424">So far as I am aware, no, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.183" offset="6885022">Let me address the question of the information to the SEC, which is set forth in both of our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.584" offset="6906547">The events that are involved in this case took place in 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.317" offset="6929535">In 1971 a former attorney who worked on the staff of the SEC called to say that two employees of the SEC, one Mercado and one Templeton, had information about irregularities at Equity Funding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.983" offset="6984183">We asked that they be sent in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.953" offset="6992019">They were sent in, but they were very circumspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.591" offset="7006648">They did not tell the kind of story that the lawyer promised that they would.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.790" offset="7035383">We followed up on it, and we were unable to get that information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.163" offset="7048862">At a later time, the attorney for Mercado who became concerned that his client had gone to the SEC unaccompanied by counsel then came... and then there is an issue which counsel raises as to whether an offer of immunity was made whereby Mercado allegedly would discuss that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.156" offset="7128901">From the SEC's staff's memorandum it was never perceived that such an offer was made and so that matter was not pursued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.980" offset="7164114">On the 9th of March, which was two days after Secrist told Dirks the story he had told him, the California Insurance Commission representative contacted a staff member of the Los Angeles office of the SEC to reveal in a very vague way that some allegations were being made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.303" offset="7241437">And, the response was made that the California authority should look into them and if they promise if they bring proof to contact us again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.064" offset="7268499">This has to be understood, I think, in the context that at that time approximately 10,000 complaints were received... this is back in 1973... by the SEC.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.357" offset="7305698">Today it is closer to 20,000 a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.200" offset="7313012">So, the very detailed hard story that Dirks knew and received from Secrist, and which, by the way, he corroborated in great detail by talking at length with six former and present employees of Equity Funding, was not brought to the SEC, rather a much vaguer, softer information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.100" offset="7384692">Now, it may assist analysis of this case to view Dirks as did the administrative law judge in this case as proceeding on two tracks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.859" offset="7427637">On the first track, which is what has been described to you, Dirks was seeking to confirm and expose what he believed was a fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.201" offset="7456999">And, as the administrative law judge found had Dirks confined his disclosure to The Wall Street Journal reporters, or had he gone to the authorities,</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.730" offset="7499213">"He might indeed have been perceived as the public spirited hero he portrays himself. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.008" offset="7524290">But, there is a second track.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.147" offset="7536829">Dirks informed his clients about this fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.427" offset="7549995">Secrist testified that he wanted Dirks to disseminate information to his clients so that they would sell Equity Funding securities--</text>

            <text syncTime="3048.891" offset="12351824">If I may return to the question of duty... The Commission in this case dealt with Secrist and Dirks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.010" offset="12400307">Secrist was an insider and as an insider owed a duty to shareholders of Equity Funding and to those who were to become shareholders by the very act of buying the stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.055" offset="12440431">And, that duty was a duty of disclosure to them, a duty not to defraud them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.801" offset="12459448">And, that duty rests upon the fiduciary relationship recognized in the common law between the corporate insider and the shareholder and not on the separate and distinct duty of the insider to the corporation to preserve the confidentiality of the corporation's secrets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.483" offset="12534158">Dirks and the Solicitor General who has filed a brief in this case confused these two duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.931" offset="12555997">They disregard the duty to the shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.760" offset="12571252">They argue instead that because Secrist had no duty to keep confidential the information about the fraud he breached no duty to Equity Funding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.490" offset="12610227">Now, this Court recognized in the Chiarella case in discussing the traditional prohibitions against insider trading by insiders and their tippees that the duty to disclose inside information arises not from any obligation to the corporate source of the information, but from the</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.620" offset="12686713">"relationship between the corporate insider and the stockholders of the corporation. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.949" offset="12704059">The Court there referred among other sources to the Commission's Katie Roberts decision in which the Commission had recognized that a relationship of trust and confidence exists between the shareholders of a corporation and its insiders giving rise to a duty of disclosure in order to prevent a corporate insider from taking advantage of the uninformed shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.428" offset="12782008">The Court also refers to this Court's 1909 decision in Strong v. Repide essentially for a similar proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.236" offset="12817221">Now, the duty to shareholders is separate from the duty of confidentiality that the insider also owes to the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.777" offset="12847314">This case, as I mentioned before, is not about confidentiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.527" offset="12866331">It is not about the corporation's interest in keeping the fraud quiet.</text>

            <text syncTime="3685.161" offset="14896881">That is where the whole notion came from.</text>
            <text syncTime="3686.896" offset="14903778">Now, how can you possibly apply that theory to information with respect to an illegal ongoing fraud which the management has been concealing for 11 years and will conceal for the rest of all of our lives if it can.</text>
