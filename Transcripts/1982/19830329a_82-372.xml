            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="10.884" offset="197557">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.058" offset="202259">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.854" offset="213439">This is a Freedom of Information Act case in which the Respondent, Grolier Incorporated, seeks access to work product prepared by Federal Trade Commission attorneys for a civil action that ended several years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.018" offset="274148">The Commission denied the FOIA request on the ground that the documents were protected by the attorney work product privilege and were therefore exempt from disclosure under Exemption 5 of the FOIA.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.997" offset="334020">Exemption 5 protects against mandatory disclosure of memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party in litigation with the agency, and it's quite clear from the legislative history of the FOIA and from this Court's decisions that Exemption 5 incorporates the work product privilege and is intended to protect the work product of Government attorneys against mandatory public disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.593" offset="452407">The Court of Appeals nonetheless ordered the documents disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.718" offset="472887">The D.C. Circuit held that attorney work product from terminated litigation remains privileged only when litigation related to the terminated action exists or potentially exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.117" offset="534536">We have sought review of this holding because it's contrary to every other appellate ruling on the temporal scope of the work product privilege and because it would have a particularly devastating effect on the conduct and working papers of Government attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.576" offset="600365">Now, the facts of this case can be briefly stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.157" offset="614680">In 1972 the Government brought a civil action against the Americana Corporation, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Grolier, charging Americana with violating a 1949 cease and desist order prohibiting false advertising and misrepresentations in the door to door sale of encyclopedias.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.929" offset="697749">The suit was dismissed in 1976 when the FTC refused to comply with a discovery order requiring it to turn over certain documents relating to a covert investigation of Americana's sales techniques.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.860" offset="757518">In 1978 Grolier brought this FOIA suit seeking access to records relating to the Americana investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.136" offset="790536">In response, the FTC turned over literally 7,000 pages of documents, but it withheld a very few documents on the ground of attorney work product.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.149" offset="830660">The district court conducted an in camera examination of the disputed documents and agreed with the FTC that they constituted attorney work product.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.221" offset="874964">The district court found that the documents encompassed opinions by FTC attorneys regarding the evidentiary needs of the Americana action and discussed specific methods of obtaining evidence for use in that litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.871" offset="933478">The district court therefore found that the documents fell squarely within the work product privilege and were therefore exempt from disclosure under Exemption 5 of the FOIA.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="230.531" offset="1076211">And Mr. Geller, in the earlier action, as I understand it, the district court had actually ordered that the documents be disclosed under Rule 26; is that right?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_s_geller" startTime="241.337" stopTime="257.176">

            <text syncTime="241.758" offset="1121038">The district court found that Americana had made a sufficient showing of need for the documents and of hardship to overcome the qualified privilege that attached to the documents, and the judge ordered the disclosure of the documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.925" offset="1169730">But they were not disclosed and instead the suit was dismissed.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="257.176" stopTime="270.170">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="257.176" offset="1182791">Why can't we say that if a district court has ordered disclosure then that's within the category of documents referred to by Sears that are routinely disclosed?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_s_geller" startTime="270.170" stopTime="299.689">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="270.170" offset="1234722">Well, I think what the Court... what the exemption means and what the Court said in Sears is that Exemption 5 protects against documents, disclosure of documents that would not be routinely disclosed in the sense that are not subject to any privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.022" offset="1306089">But work product documents, even the documents involved in this case, are not routinely disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.177" offset="1326778">They were only disclosed in the Americana action because that particular plaintiff was able to make a sufficient showing of need.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.987" offset="1349975">But if--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="299.689" stopTime="304.077">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="299.689" offset="1352796">But I suppose they are routinely disclosed if the court orders them to be disclosed.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_s_geller" startTime="304.077" stopTime="469.777">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="304.077" offset="1370350">--Well, that can't be what the exemption means or what this Court meant when it used the phrase "normally privileged", or else it would wipe out all qualified privileges, because every qualified privilege by definition can be overcome by a sufficient showing of need.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.384" offset="1427611">But that's not the category of documents that would be routinely disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.509" offset="1444120">I think what the legislative history clearly shows is that Exemption 5 was meant to protect documents that are subject to absolute or qualified privileges, and clearly it meant to encompass documents subject to the work product privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.125" offset="1510576">Now, the D.C. Circuit reversed and, even though it agreed that these documents were unquestionably subject to the work product privilege, the court noted that the Americana action, the action as to which these documents had been prepared, had ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.226" offset="1582987">And the court announced that in its view the work product privilege should not extend beyond the termination of the litigation for which the documents were prepared, except where litigation related to that first litigation exists or potentially exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.083" offset="1654353">The court, however, quickly rejected the notion that an FOIA suit such as Grolier's here could be considered a related action, and then it announced that it didn't appear that there were any other related actions in existence or on the horizon.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.949" offset="1709838">Therefore, the court remanded the case to the district court to reassess the work product claim in light of the test it announced in regard to related litigation and in light of the fact that the court suggested that there was no so-called related litigation in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.662" offset="1776711">We believe that the Court of Appeals decision is plainly wrong for two independent reasons: First, the court's interpretation of the duration of the work product privilege is fundamentally inconsistent with the underlying purposes of the privilege, and it creates a test that's frankly unworkable.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.014" offset="1858109">And second, even if the Court of Appeals were correct in its ruling as to the temporal scope of the work product privilege and the fact that it's not perpetual in civil discovery, that wouldn't mean that those same qualifications exist under the FOIA because, as I mentioned a moment ago in responding to the question of Justice O'Connor, documents may be obtained under the FOIA only if they would be routinely discoverable in civil litigation, in other words not subject to any privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.141" offset="1978585">And even under the D.C. Circuit's newfangled work product test, attorney work product from terminated litigation would not be routinely disclosed in subsequent litigation, but would only be disclosed when certain additional criteria are met.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="469.777" stopTime="490.534">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="469.777" offset="2033129">Mr. Geller, your argument suggests that there's a lot more analytical coherence to that exemption than I've ever thought there was.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.865" offset="2065521">Do you really think that the language "routinely disclosed" and so forth lends itself to rather precise application based on analogies to ordinary civil lawsuits?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_s_geller" startTime="490.534" stopTime="539.248">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="490.534" offset="2116198">The Court has suggested in cases like EPA against Mink that just by virtue of the nature of FOIA litigation, for example, the plaintiff needn't make any showing of need.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.670" offset="2156740">The civil discovery privileges have to be applied by way of rough analogies.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.170" offset="2174713">But with the work product privilege it's left no doubt in cases such as Sears and Roebuck and Federal Open Market Committee that Exemption 5 was plainly intended to incorporate the work product privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.131" offset="2226540">The legislative history of the Act shows that it was intended to apply under the FOIA just as it does in civil litigation, and it's quite clear that work product is always subject to a privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.378" offset="2271575">It may only be a qualified privilege, especially when we're dealing with non-opinion work product.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.407" offset="2287666">But there really is no uncertainty, I think, as to this aspect of Exemption 5 that it's not routinely discoverable.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="539.248" offset="2311072">Isn't there a problem, though, in carrying over the statutory language when you have a totally abstract defendant, the Government, and there isn't any live lawsuit, in which you can ordinarily draw the conclusions you have to draw and decide whether to allow discovery of something or not?</text>
            <text syncTime="556.039" offset="2378154">It's just kind of a half a lawsuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="558.133" offset="2386618">I think that's one of the severe problems with applying the D.C. Circuit's related litigation test in the context of a FOIA case, which I hope to get to in a little while.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.786" offset="2421204">But it's clear from Sears and Roebuck that the work product privilege applies in the FOIA context and that a plaintiff's need for it is to be assessed under the least compelling circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.623" offset="2472509">In other words, it's analogized to a plaintiff who in civil discovery could show nothing more than mere relevance.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.637" offset="2496541">And it's quite clear that in civil discovery a plaintiff who can show nothing more than mere relevance is not entitled to work product, because it's subject to a qualified privilege and he has to show more than mere relevance, he has to show need and hardship.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="614.937" offset="2613779">Well, as to certain documents the Government did, as to the work product documents in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.918" offset="2629661">Many of them are memoranda, for example, either to the files or memoranda that are not being written to a final decisionmaker but are merely being written in order to assess various aspects of a particular litigation, and therefore those documents may not fall within the deliberative process privilege, although they would seem clearly to fall within the work product privilege, as both the district court and the Court of Appeals in this case held.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.628" offset="2732584">So while in some categories of cases there may be an overlap between the two privileges, in this case I don't think there is an overlap and in a great many cases there wouldn't be an overlap.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.404" offset="2771663">All the Government would have available to it would be the work product privilege.</text>

            <text syncTime="657.371" offset="2783470">And Exemption 7 would not have covered the Government's request here, I take it?</text>

            <text syncTime="662.839" offset="2805413">Well, Exemption 7 has a number of facets to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.618" offset="2820460">Not only do you have to show that there's a pending enforcement action, but you also have to show that it falls into one of the other categories of documents that are protected from mandatory disclosure, and no Exemption 7 claim was made here.</text>

            <text syncTime="922.264" offset="3843101">That's correct, and in that sense he would not be free to waive.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.136" offset="3858566">If that's the sense of Justice Stevens' question, he would not be free to waive the work product that adheres in any papers that belong to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.760" offset="3889077">But there's really no question of waiver of any sort in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.755" offset="3909034">Now, the concerns that I was mentioning earlier about why there is a work product privilege in the first place are perhaps most compelling during the period when a case is being litigated, but it seems to us it's equally clear that many of the harms that the work product privilege is designed to avoid would be almost as likely to occur if the privilege were to end with the termination of the litigation for which the documents were prepared, because attorneys would still be reluctant to commit certain thoughts to writing if they realized that they'd have to share those thoughts with an opponent at any time, not just while the case is alive.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.197" offset="4042781">And if attorneys did prepare memoranda that might reflect unfavorably on them or their clients or their legal theories, they perhaps would have a tremendous incentive to destroy those documents at the time the case ended if the work product privilege ended at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.285" offset="4111222">This took would lead to inefficiencies in the giving of legal advice or in the preparation of cases for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.112" offset="4134523">The principal reason that's generally given for construing privileges narrowly is that it inhibits the search for truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.590" offset="4164407">But it's hard to see how the search for truth would be enhanced by a rule that led people to destroy documents rather than take a chance that they might have to be turned over at some later time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.100" offset="4214458">So essentially for these reasons, there's unanimity or general agreement among the lower courts that the work product privilege really can't cease at the time the litigation ceases, but has to to some extent retain its privilege status thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.535" offset="4276211">Even the D.C. Circuit agreed with that in this case, because they held that the privilege survives in certain instances where there's related litigation or potential for related litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.044" offset="4318216">But it seems to us that that test is not responsive to the concerns that underlie the work product privilege and it's not at all workable in practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.336" offset="4355415">First of all, I think it's plainly wrong to conclude that the harms associated with allowing discovery of work product are limited to discovery in so-called related actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.582" offset="4400345">The harm can be equally as great when discovery is made in a so-called unrelated action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.689" offset="4424796">But even if we were to accept the Court of Appeals' premise that there are differences about so-called related and unrelated actions, the principal flaw in the D.C. Circuit's test is that it's impossible to apply the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.198" offset="4478817">There would be no certainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.980" offset="4485922">There has to be a substantial degree of certainty, predictability as to the scope of the protection, if the work product privilege is going to achieve the results that justify its existence in the very first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.161" offset="4534719">The Court observed in Hickman against Taylor that if attorneys know that their work product is subject to discovery they'll behave in a way that would necessarily be harmful to the adversary system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.765" offset="4585083">And many of the harmful consequences the privilege is designed to avoid are therefore the result of what a lawyer can reasonably anticipate at the time he's putting the materials together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.371" offset="4627506">Certainty as to the scope of the privilege is therefore essential.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.056" offset="4642239">This Court said in a closely related context in the Upjohn case just a couple of terms ago that a privilege that's uncertain in scope or that leads to widely varying results in seemingly similar cases is really no better than no privilege at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="1168.288" offset="4827186">There's always going to be some uncertainty when you're dealing with qualified privileges, and we agree to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.141" offset="4850592">But the D.C. Circuit has extended, expanded the level of uncertainty to the situation where it would be totally unworkable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1249.468" offset="5151940">And I'd say it would be quite bizarre if that wasn't what Congress intended, because if that wasn't what Congress intended Congress would have been repealing the work product privilege and every other qualified privilege in Government litigation, because it would mean that any person in litigation with the Government who couldn't make the showing of need necessary to overcome the privilege in civil litigation would just file an FOIA request and he would get it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.099" offset="5238458">It's quite clear from the legislative history that that's not what Congress had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.364" offset="5259460">I should add that this whole notion of work product privilege as restricted to so-called related cases is based on a rather myopic and I think naive view of litigation, especially Government litigation, because especially with Government litigation it's hardly the case that the Government's interests end when a particular case ends.</text>

            <text syncTime="1299.573" offset="5352352">In this case, for example, this unfair method of competition case against Americana was just part of the FTC's continuing efforts to police the marketplace to eliminate deceptive practices, and much of the work product is not related to one particular case but may lay out the Government's litigative strategies in a whole range of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.439" offset="5435839">It would be quite useful to potential adversaries of the Government or regulatees to wait until some case terminates and then get the work product for that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.311" offset="5479307">In fact, Grolier in this very case is not particularly shy about why it wants this work product.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.244" offset="5506997">In its complaint which is reprinted at page 12 of the joint appendix, Grolier says that it wants the information in this case which is subject to the work product privilege because Grolier is a Respondent in an above-mentioned adjudicative proceeding that was then before the FTC, and plaintiff, that is Grolier, believes that such records may have some bearing on certain issues raised in that proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.405" offset="5611696">And in a letter that Grolier sent contemporaneously to the FTC in connection with its FOIA request for these work product documents, it says:</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.025" offset="5642102">"We seek access to the records in question because we believe such records may have some bearing on certain issues raised in another pending FTC proceeding against Grolier raising similar sorts of unfair method of competition issues. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.973" offset="5697900">So I think it would be devastating and it could not have been within the contemplation of Congress that this sort of work product material would have to be given over even if the case, one case, may technically have ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.485" offset="5743980">Finally, the related litigation test is flawed because it's wholly unresponsive to the concerns underlying the privilege, because it ignores the fact that subsequent unrelated litigation often precedes the institution of related litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.306" offset="5807300">And if the FOIA request were made at the time when there was no litigation pending, then the materials would have to be given over and then people could use that to bring a related suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.097" offset="5850455">That's precisely what the work product privilege is designed to prevent, is the use of one lawyer's opinions, thought processes, legal research, for the purpose of helping his adversary bring a lawsuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1610.363" offset="6595467">But that... I've just been discovering that test... discussing that test in the context of civil discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.361" offset="6619500">It is possible to figure out how the test would work in civil discovery, I suppose, because there really have to be two lawsuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.969" offset="6641965">There's lawsuit one, which is the suit in which the documents were prepared; then there's lawsuit two, which is the suit in which the documents are being sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.322" offset="6671327">And I suppose some judge could make some judgment as to whether suit one relates to suit two in some as yet undefined way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.820" offset="6705286">And of course in civil litigation the person seeking the documents in suit two would have to make some showing of relevance, and that would help the judge make a determination as to whether suit one was related to suit two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.489" offset="6748022">But I have no idea how this test the D.C. Circuit announced would work in the context of an FOIA request, because there is no second suit in an FOIA, in the FOIA context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.000" offset="6793998">The D.C. Circuit and Grolier are adamant in saying that an FOIA suit can never be a related suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.323" offset="6823359">So if I understand what the D.C. Circuit is saying in the FOIA context, it is when an FOIA request comes in for documents in a previous suit the agency and ultimately the courts must ask themselves whether there is some third suit in existence or potentially in existence, and whether the third suit is related in some as yet undescribed way to the subject matter of the first suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.580" offset="6916355">This is I think unworkable in practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.969" offset="6929939">We find it hard to believe that that's what Congress meant when they made clear that Exemption 5 incorporates the work product privilege, and we would ask this Court to reject that view of the work product privilege in the context of a FOIA request.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.274" offset="6995140">If there are no further questions, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.</text>

            <text syncTime="2024.133" offset="8250585">--Your Honor, the only reason we have raised that point is to indicate that this case is slightly different than the type of documents that were generated by Mr. Fortenbas in Hickman versus Taylor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.268" offset="8299069">That's the only point we're making on those particular documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.563" offset="8312339">We are not saying that because there was some "unethical violation" that the Government loses that privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.371" offset="8339506">We mainly point that out as the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.152" offset="8350687">The facts of this case are very clear that in point of fact this contact was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.105" offset="8370435">But that is not necessary and we do not urge that the Court has to reach that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.542" offset="8388198">The point we are making is that, based upon the record before Judge Fisher, the judge did order those documents produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.022" offset="8418082">That is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.395" offset="8423620">We believe under Exemption 5 the result is very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.176" offset="8438771">Exemption 5 does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.271" offset="8447131">The reason Exemption 5 does not apply is because the exemption talks about documents not available in litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.640" offset="8476597">The Government of course has a great deal of difficulty with that argument, and so Mr. Geller and the briefs present a syllogism, and there is some practicality or simplicity to it, but upon examination it falls apart.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.932" offset="8533753">Here is what the Government says:</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.136" offset="8542530">Point number one: Documents are available under FOIA only if "routinely available" in civil litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.395" offset="8575653">Point number two: To get work product documents in civil litigation under Rule 26 you always have to show some need.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.672" offset="8612747">The Government therefore concludes that you may never in a FOIA case ever get work product because to get work product you would necessarily have had to make a showing of need in the private litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.464" offset="8667918">That, Your Honor, is simply inconsistent with what this Court has said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.495" offset="8684009">Justice Powell, for instance, in his concurring opinion in NLRB against Robbins, which this Court cited with approval in Merrill, makes it very clear that the work product standards under the Civil Rules of Procedure are not as broad as work product under FOIA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.096" offset="8750465">Indeed, there are circumstances where this Court has directed work product to be produced in FOIA cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.717" offset="8784946">For instance, some courts have read the Sears opinion to say work product of a factual nature which winds up in a final opinion is produceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.589" offset="8820368">At least four circuits have held... Deering Milliken and the Robbins case, and the Fifth Circuit reversed on other grounds... have said purely factual work product is available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.805" offset="8865299">The Government's argument necessarily would have to have this Court accept the proposition that work product is never available in FOIA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.503" offset="8904065">That is not what this Court has ever said and it would have this Court overrule four different Circuits which have said that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.767" offset="8933113">The only point, to respond again to the Chief Justice's comments with respect to what our contentions are with respect to the so-called practices that Mr. Howerton took, are with respect to the Hickman versus Taylor argument that we hear much about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.323" offset="8991313">If I might have a brief bit of license with legal history, let us suppose that Mr. Fortenbas, the attorney involved in Hickman, instead of going out after he was hired by the tugboat owners and the underwriters, and instead of interviewing third party witnesses before the litigation had commenced, had advised his clients as follows: Wait until petitioner in Hickman files a lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.141" offset="9090579">After the petitioner in Hickman files a lawsuit then you, my clients, hire some agents to go talk to the petitioner surreptitiously and try to get some "evidence".</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.840" offset="9133420">The only point... that's this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.354" offset="9147421">That is the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.475" offset="9155989">The only point I am making and that we make in our briefs on that issue... and again, I don't suggest the Court need reach it, but I think it's important to understand the type of documents we're talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.021" offset="9194128">The point that we are making, that if those had been the facts of Hickman versus Taylor I respectfully suggest that the rule announced by the Court in that opinion would have been substantially different.</text>

            <text syncTime="2484.691" offset="10092845">--Your Honor, a lot of times the Government will take a dismissal with prejudice, as they did in Leggett &amp; Platt, and appeal that up to the Circuit Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.017" offset="10118131">The Government did neither.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.218" offset="10122938">To answer Your Honor's question, yes, because that's what Exemption 5 says, documents available in litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.311" offset="10151255">They'd have to show that they were not available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.495" offset="10160032">Moreover, the Government's argument that it has to be routinely available, which they take from Senate Report 813 and this Court's statement in Sears, was concerned about the hypothetical plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.008" offset="10202037">Let's not forget, it is conceivable that one could conjure up a hypothetical plaintiff in civil litigation who might be able to show need for a certain document.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.814" offset="10241325">That is what the Court was concerned about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.766" offset="10253132">Mr. Geller's statement that it is improper to order these documents produced on the theory of routinely available misconstrues the legislative history that this Court has talked about and that clearly is set forth in Senate Rule 813.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.936" offset="10313736">I'd like Your Honors... and if Your Honors want to reach the judgment of the Court of Appeals, I'd like to address that issue also.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.151" offset="10338605">First of all, counsel is simply incorrect when he states that the Court of Appeals conflicts with other circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.288" offset="10367235">I assume he is talking about Duplan in the Fourth Circuit, Leggett &amp; Platt in the Sixth Circuit, and Murphy in the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.519" offset="10400149">Those cases indeed hold in the civil litigation context, in the civil litigation context under Rule 26, that work product will not terminate after the litigation is over.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.481" offset="10451976">Those are Rule 26 cases, not inconsistent with FOIA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.545" offset="10468172">But more important, in each of those circuit court opinions, Your Honor, the courts have said, we might not hold this but for the fact that work product is qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.398" offset="10519581">Therefore, even under the holdings in those circuit court opinions the plaintiffs, if they were able to make a showing, could still get those documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.283" offset="10551137">And indeed, Your Honor, in Leggett &amp; Platt the Sixth Circuit remanded and said, although we fashion this rule, if the plaintiff can show in the district court that he really needs this he'll get these documents anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.529" offset="10596172">The point being that when the Government says the D.C. Circuit's rule conflicts, it's simply not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.092" offset="10622399">Moreover, at least two Justices of this Court have hinted that the work product rule should terminate at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.883" offset="10653537">I refer to Justice White's concurring opinion in United States versus Nobles, concurred in by Justice Rehnquist.</text>

            <text syncTime="2639.409" offset="10711633">Justice White says in the concurring opinion: Point number one, Hickman versus Taylor didn't say there was a privilege for work product.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.156" offset="10742667">Indeed, if the Court carefully examines Hickman versus Taylor, the Court says the documents are not available because they're not discoverable under Rule 26.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.541" offset="10784149">Justice White went further and said, there was some reason the Supreme Court in Hickman versus Taylor said, it's not a privilege, it's simply not discoverable, because the Court wanted to leave open the possibility, as I read Justice White's opinion, that maybe this material, this so-called work product, would be available post-discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.862" offset="10865442">Justice White also points out in that concurring opinion the reasons for having the work product privilege in discovery, i.e., that a lawyer, be it a Government lawyer or anybody else, would not want to amass the information for fear his adversary will get it, is evaporated at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.558" offset="10944228">A fortiori, if it is evaporated at trial, clearly it's evaporated when the litigation is dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.478" offset="10975993">And the D.C. Circuit went farther than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.302" offset="10987278">It said if there's any related litigation you're not going to get it, and if there's any potentially related litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2769.246" offset="11231052">But I would say that, Your Honor, the D.C.

            <text syncTime="2785.539" offset="11296149">But certainly under the D.C. Circuit they couldn't, and I think, Your Honor, that should give ample protection to the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="2997.014" offset="12142099">Therefore, the Court should examine these parameters not under Rule 26 but under FOIA legislative history that says, as the D.C. Circuit said, disclosure at a zenith.</text>

            <text syncTime="3017.365" offset="12223496">The argument that there may be some harm in civil discovery is simply not before this Court, and nothing the D.C. Circuit said would indicate that this particular ruling could apply in the work product rule or under Rule 26.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.263" offset="12287131">Finally, I'd like to turn to the so-called parade of horribles that the Government is suggesting will happen if the D.C. Circuit's rule is upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.854" offset="12321403">First of all, they say if this rule is the case and is upheld the Government will not amass or prepare its case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.256" offset="12355049">Probably the best answer I could give to that is what Justice White said concurring in Nobles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.443" offset="12375842">If the purpose of the work product rule, as Justice White said, is to protect the adversary process, when the litigation is over and your adversary cannot get those documents and use them against you, the raison d'etre, if you will, of Hickman evaporates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.029" offset="12458180">Now, I submit that that is clearly the situation in this particular litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.791" offset="12485243">When the lawsuit is over, clearly when it's dismissed with prejudice, not even having to get to the issue of related litigation, the so-called advantage that Hickman versus Taylor was concerned about simply, simply will not happen, because the other lawyer can't use those work product materials against the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.267" offset="12567059">The Government has other parades of horribles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.642" offset="12576567">The Government says Government attorneys will not write mistakes or memorialize their wrongdoing or errors in the files.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.217" offset="12618886">Well, there's nothing in the record to indicate that that would happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.809" offset="12633305">This is an argument they make on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.728" offset="12640933">But I think it's clear, Your Honor, that lawyers simply do not sit around writing memorandums to the files indicating that they've made all kinds of mistakes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.852" offset="12677400">That simply is a red herring.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.958" offset="12685864">The Government also says that now we might have to destroy our files, heaven forbid, if this rule stays.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.160" offset="12714703">Well, in point of fact, as the Government points out, Government lawyers are very transient, and I think this Court should accept the clear proposition that Government lawyers are not going to destroy their files because of this so-called work product privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.577" offset="12772381">As I believe Justice O'Connor said, the work product privilege today is qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.026" offset="12802161">Under the rationale of the Government, all those fears would happen right now, because it may well be that Mr. Geller's work product in this case conceivably could be ordered produced by a federal district judge if some other conceivable party would make a showing of need.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.580" offset="12872378">Many of the arguments the Government makes, in other words, clearly are not going to have any application, because the fears, the so-called concerns, are already there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.733" offset="12916995">With respect to so-called pending investigations, Exemption No. 7 is there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.652" offset="12940610">There's also Exemption No. 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.559" offset="12948238">The Government didn't use that exemption in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.402" offset="12959627">I don't know why.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.369" offset="12963493">Maybe they forgot about it, maybe they made a mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.181" offset="12974778">But clearly a concern that Government lawyers would have could be covered under Exemption 7 or Exemption 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.817" offset="13001318">Let's talk about the related test in my few remaining minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.001" offset="13018037">The Government says, well, we can't fashion a related litigation test, it's impossible, no court will ever do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.562" offset="13040293">Well, Your Honors, it happens all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.390" offset="13051578">Section 5 of the APA has the issue about related litigation, whether if you sit as a factfinder on it, whether you can do that if you were working on the investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.684" offset="13092747">The FTC has interpreted that many times.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.231" offset="13102987">Section 28 U.S.C. 1407, just for another example, the venue statute, says if there are common questions of law and fact maybe they should be multidistricted in one case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.538" offset="13152202">United Mine Workers versus Gibbs says, common issues of fact, whether it arises out of the same concern, whether it arises out of the same circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.500" offset="13192012">I am not suggesting that this Court should adopt one of those so-called related litigation tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.921" offset="13213746">All I am suggesting is that it is a workable rule, courts have done it all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.513" offset="13236107">The Government simply errs when it says we can't do that, we can't fashion that test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.697" offset="13252825">The best thing to do, Your Honors, I submit, is to have this done on a case by case basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.055" offset="13274246">After all, under the Sherman Act rule of reason the Court annunciates the rule of reason law and rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.883" offset="13293576">It doesn't say, here is every circumstance that is reasonable conduct or not reasonable conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.770" offset="13317087">That's for determination on a case by case basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.270" offset="13327118">Finally, with respect to potential litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.690" offset="13340806">First of all, the D.C. Circuit had that test to help the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.749" offset="13357002">Mr. Geller got that test to help him, because without it it would just be related litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.451" offset="13379885">Now he doesn't like it and he attacks that and apparently he thinks that's why the judgment should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.091" offset="13398380">Again, related litigation and potentially related litigation; you have the same test in great part.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.900" offset="13425651">I would suggest the following, potential related litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.851" offset="13437459">The Government could say, we have a grand jury investigation going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.225" offset="13450938">The Government could say, we have subpoenas under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.739" offset="13472985">The Government can say, we have an investigation under the FTC.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.470" offset="13487927">These are examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.269" offset="13491062">There are others.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.205" offset="13494824">The only thing I am saying is that the potential related litigation test is workable, it's been done in other contexts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.919" offset="13525753">This Court need not concern itself right now with formulating a specific test because the Court of Appeals said, remand this thing back to the district court and the district court will determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.902" offset="13565668">Lastly if I may, this question about why we want these documents and doesn't this relate to the FTC-Grolier proceeding in the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.396" offset="13595656">In point of fact, as we submitted to the Clerk last week, the administrative law judge which had that proceeding said, these cases are not related.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.316" offset="13631287">I'm now referring to the Ninth Circuit proceeding and the Americana proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.720" offset="13648946">And the Government, the FTC, the petitioner in this case, said those cases are not related.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.798" offset="13669217">Again, the Court doesn't have to reach that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.357" offset="13679457">It's not before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.185" offset="13686771">I only point that out here because Mr. Geller thinks it's important and he wants to make the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.871" offset="13709550">Also, we don't say and we never have that because of the so-called other case out there we have a need for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.897" offset="13737658">We have never argued in this Court that we should get these documents because of need or because of anything else, because respondent recognizes under Sears that that does not make us any greater or give us any lesser right to obtain these documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.130" offset="13798576">Thank you very much, Your Honors.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="3415.469" offset="13815921">Just one or two things, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.624" offset="13828564">I want to make sure there are no misunderstandings in light of respondent's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.621" offset="13844551">We do take the position that under Exemption 5 documents that are subject to a qualified privilege, that is that are subject to the work product privilege, cannot be mandatorily disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.942" offset="13897841">In other words, the word "routinely" has a meaning there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.428" offset="13911738">The fact that one judge in one particular case may have found that a plaintiff has shown the need doesn't need that that document would be routinely disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.234" offset="13942980">And in this very case, in response to Justice White's question, Judge Fisher in the Americana litigation made a finding defendant had substantial need for the documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.031" offset="13982164">No suggestion that these sorts of documents would be routinely disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.698" offset="14000868">Unless qualified privileges are covered by Exemption 5, as they clearly appear to be by the legislative history, then Congress would have effectively repealed qualified privileges such as the work product privilege or the confidential commercial information privilege at issue in Merrill when it passed the Freedom of Information Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.284" offset="14079131">We can't believe Congress intended to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.609" offset="14096476">Now, secondly, Respondent has suggested many times that this is a very narrow decision, it only applies in the Freedom of Information Act context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.014" offset="14130122">And it's true that the D.C. Circuit sprinkled in a few places in its opinion the suggestion that this is a FOIA case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.292" offset="14155199">But of course, there's no analytical support for that sort of a distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.744" offset="14177038">Exemption 5 is clearly tied right to civil discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.163" offset="14190726">The legislative history and this Court's opinions in Sears and Roebuck... and I would refer the Court to footnote 16 in Sears and Roebuck... shows that the exemption is intended to mirror civil discovery, and therefore the Court has to consider not only the FOIA context but whether this is a workable rule.</text>
