            <label>Mr. Elliott Schulder</label>
            <text syncTime="15.141" offset="205045">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.783" offset="227614">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the question presented in this immigration case is whether a permanent resident alien who is believed by immigration authorities to be excludable from the United States on his return from a trip abroad is entitled to litigate the issues of his entry and excludability in a deportation hearing, as the court of appeals of the Ninth Circuit held in this case, rather than in an exclusion hearing, as Congress mandated in the Immigration and Nationality Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.396" offset="358122">Before proceeding to the facts of the case, I would like to put this question into some perspective by briefly reviewing some of the pertinent statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.442" offset="398246">The Immigration Act preserves a long-standing distinction between aliens arriving at the border seeking admission to this country and aliens who are already within the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.512" offset="450491">Aliens who are arriving at the border seeking admission or readmission who are believed not entitled to enter are subject to exclusion proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.998" offset="492496">Aliens who are within the United States who are believed not entitled to remain are subject to deportation proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.802" offset="523738">The Immigration Act provides various categories of excludable aliens, and also provides procedures governing the exclusion of inadmissible aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.601" offset="574938">Under 8 USC 1225, every alien arriving at a U.S. port of entry and seeking admission or readmission to this country is subject to inspection by an immigration officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.620" offset="626974">If the alien does not appear beyond a doubt to the immigration officer to be entitled to land, he is detained for an exclusion hearing that is conducted before an immigration judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.807" offset="671696">These exclusion procedures apply whenever an alien attempts an entry into the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.122" offset="700953">The term 8 USC 1101 (a)(13), as any coming of an alien into the United States from a foreign country.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.170" offset="745152">However, there is an exception to this broad definition in the case of permanent resident aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.163" offset="773156">A return to the United States following an unintentional departure by a lawful permanent resident alien is not regarded as an entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.640" offset="811085">In Rosenberg versus Fleuti, this Court held that an innocent, casual, and brief trip abroad is deemed not to have been intended as meaningfully interruptive of an alien's permanent residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.949" offset="868241">The statute interpreted... the Court interpreted the statute in this way in order to protect resident aliens from unsuspected risks and unintended consequences of wholly innocent actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.798" offset="919650">One of the factors that the Court noted in Fleuti as being crucial in determining the nature of an alien's trip is whether the purpose of the trip was to accomplish an object contrary to the policies reflected in our immigration laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.239" offset="981404">The facts of this case show that Respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, was admitted to the United States as a permanent resident alien in 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.786" offset="1031663">On June 29th, 1975, Respondent was returning from a two-day trip to Mexico with her husband when she was arrested at the border for attempting to smuggle six illegal aliens into this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.564" offset="1082759">Respondent was detained for an exclusion hearing to determine whether she was excludable under a provision of the Immigration Act that provides for the exclusion of any alien who knowingly and for gain aids the attempted illegal entry of aliens into this country.</text>

            <text syncTime="667.108" offset="2812901">In addition, the judge found that Respondent had made an entry because she engaged in conduct contrary to the immigration laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.001" offset="2844457">Thus, under Fleuti, Respondent's departure was not unintended within the exception to the entry doctrine in the Immigration Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="692.253" offset="2913525">The District Court remanded the case to the Immigration Service with directions to proceed against Respondent, if at all, only in deportation proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.810" offset="2951768">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed and held that whenever a resident alien returning from trip abroad claims that his trip was not meaningfully interruptive of his permanent residence, the issues of entry and excludability must be litigated in deportation and not in exclusion proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.802" offset="3031703">Thus, under the Ninth Circuit's holding, every returning resident alien coming back from a trip abroad, no matter the duration or no matter the purpose for which that trip was undertaken, is automatically entitled to return to this country so long as that alien claims that his departure was not meaningfully interruptive.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.957" offset="3124281">There is no basis in law for the Court of Appeals decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.352" offset="3157926">It is clear that the Court of Appeals in this case, by holding that resident aliens are entitled to deportation proceedings, has disregarded the clear distinction that Congress drew in the Immigration Act between exclusion proceedings and deportation proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.773" offset="3219575">If there is one thing that is clear in the area of immigration law, it is that Congress has broad authority over immigration matters, including particularly the admission of aliens into this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.202" offset="3269312">The Ninth Circuit's decision in this case has interfered with the Congress's exercise of its authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.315" offset="3297734">The court purported to base its decision on Kwong Hai Chew versus Colding, and the subsequent decision of the D.C. Circuit in Kwong Hai Chew versus Rogers, which established that the immigration authorities at an exclusion hearing have the burden of proving excludability.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.692" offset="3391252">The Ninth Circuit in this case assumed that the Immigration Service has ignored the burden of proof requirement of the D.C. Circuit in Kwong Hai Chew versus Rogers, but in fact, as we show in our brief, the Immigration Service has accorded returning resident aliens a hearing at which the government bears the burden of proving excludability, so that the court's decision is based on a totally erroneous impression of the type of procedures that are available at an exclusion hearing to a resident alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.365" offset="3537956">Respondent has tried to defend the holding below by raising some additional arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.150" offset="3573064">Respondent first argues that the procedures available to permanent resident aliens in exclusion proceedings do not satisfy due process standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.928" offset="3612248">We disagree with Respondent's framing of the issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.920" offset="3628130">The government, as I mentioned in response to Justice O'Connor's question, fully agrees that resident aliens should receive procedures that meet due process standards, but that does not mean that resident aliens are entitled to a deportation hearing rather than to the exclusion hearing that Congress provided for in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.054" offset="3712663">If the procedures at exclusion hearings need to be strengthened to meet due process standards, the remedy is to provide proper safeguards in exclusion hearings, not to provide aliens with a right to deportation hearings, which is simply contrary to Congress's decision in establishing exclusion hearings in the Immigration Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1224.413" offset="5042191">That's correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.564" offset="5046788">Respondent attempts to justify the court of appeals decision by arguing that somehow it is unfair for a resident alien to be... to have both the issues of entry and excludability turn on a single immigration offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.545" offset="5122648">In other words, in this case, Respondent was found to have attempted to smuggle illegal aliens into the country, and that finding established both that she was excludable and also that she had made a meaningful interruption of her permanent residence, and thus had been attempting an entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.639" offset="5199030">But we have responded to this argument in our reply brief at Pages 6 through 8, and I would essentially like to rely on that, but I would also like to point out that Respondent's argument essentially is that the Immigration Act requires the Immigration Service to admit a resident alien into the country because of an alleged immigration violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.017" offset="5308535">In other words, if the entry and excludability issues both turn on an immigration offense rather than on two other factors, technical violations, then the Immigration Service must allow the alien to enter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.114" offset="5360989">We don't think that Congress conceivably intended this result when it established separate proceedings for exclusion and deportation of aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.190" offset="5397247">Finally, I must emphasize that there is no danger of a resident alien being excluded if he has not made an entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.216" offset="5433401">If the evidence in an exclusion hearing shows that the trip was in fact innocent, casual, and brief, the exclusion hearing must be terminated, and the alien must be allowed into the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.715" offset="5483347">So that there is no danger here that an alien will be found excludable where in fact the evidence shows that the resident alien, at least under the terms of the immigration statute, was not in fact making an entry.</text>

I was not present at the time of the hearing, but from the record, I can only determine that the notice was written to her a few minutes before the judge proceeded, the immigration judge in this case proceeded with the presentation of the case and allowed the trial attorney to go forward, and from the record again, I only discern that the judge read that you are being charged with aiding and abetting the entry of aliens into the United States for gain, the illegal entry of those aliens, although I will say that the notice itself was a little difficult to read, and I noticed that someone in fact had to make some marks over it to be read.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.565" offset="6702743">Now, in a deportation proceeding, the notice is somewhat different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.726" offset="6719356">There is an order to show cause that is issued on the Respondent that has a number of factual allegations, such as in her case it would have said, you are a native and citizen of El Salvador, you entered the United States as a permanent resident on whatever date it was in 1970, March, 1970, and you left the United States and departed from the United States on such and so date, and you were charged with, and found with aliens in your automobile, upon your re-entry to the United States on such and so date.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.102" offset="6868881">And then, after those allegations of fact are being charged, then it will say the legal ground for charge of deportability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.298" offset="6905662">In this case, it would have said that therefore, you are excludable from the United States under Section 212(a)(31) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.123" offset="6937009">Now, that is the way a deportation notice would in fact be presented to her seven days before the hearing was to commence, and then, of course, at that hearing it is simply an arraignment type of a hearing, where she is just asked to plead, do you admit the facts and admit deportability or deny them?</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.004" offset="7012555">If in fact she has counsel present, counsel in almost all instances will ask for some additional time in which to review the evidence against her.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.094" offset="7064904">Now, in an exclusion proceeding such as this at the border, it is extremely difficult, most obviously, for any alien who does not speak our language and is... in this case, Mrs. Plasencia, of course, was at San Isidro, 100 miles from her home in Los Angeles, and it was extremely difficult for her at that remote location to obtain counsel with approximately maybe 12 hours' notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.896" offset="7184127">It is hard to tell from the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.825" offset="7187784">It looks as though she was arrested the evening before, and the hearing concluded at 11:00 a.m. the next morning, so she probably had around 12 hours to obtain counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.843" offset="7227908">They were not wealthy people, and so they may very well have had to have contacted one of the organizations in Los Angeles that were able to do pro bono or other kinds of free representation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2116.598" offset="8610935">It basically was talking about what the definition of entry was to be in the 1952 Act, and by the time the Court's decision in fact was published, the '52 Act was history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.386" offset="8658060">It had in fact been promulgated, and passed by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.612" offset="8686899">I think I would like at this point to again restate the issue difference in terms of the emphasis by the government and the Respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.250" offset="8741443">The government states the charge of excludability itself, just the charge calls for a conclusion of meaningful departure, and therefore calls for a conclusion of exclusion rather than deportation, not the proof of the charge, the making of the charge by the Immigration Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.405" offset="8822109">The Respondent emphasizes that the person is a returning permanent resident who has lived in the United States, has a home in the United States, had been admitted to the United States as a permanent resident at one time, had gone through all of the inspection process, had been given a permanent resident card, and then made a brief visit, a two-day visit to Tiajuana, and was returning from that two-day visit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.352" offset="8941854">Now, the question is not whether the charge of smuggling aliens or aiding and abetting illegal entry is true or false at that point, until there has been a hearing to make that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.922" offset="8992218">In this case, the fact that the District Director of Immigration handed this piece of paper, which was the exclusion notice, to Mrs. Plasencia, the mere handing, that act of handing that to her, made her excludable instead of deportable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.193" offset="9057316">That is what we have a great deal of difficulty in understanding, that approach, and we feel that is exactly what happened in Rosenberg versus Fleuti, which is what we would like to see happen in this case, which is that a deportation proceeding should have been initiated under Section 241(a)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which states that a person is now deportable if they were at the time of any entry excludable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.570" offset="9178733">Now, of course, the 32 grounds of excludability are encompassed within Section 241(a)(1), so the government certainly would have not been prejudiced by the bringing of that deportation charge, and through Section 212(a)(31), could have then been adjudicated in a deportation setting, and it is possible that the conclusion of that case would have been that she was found excludable because she had... deportable because she had been excludable at the time of entry.</text>

            <text syncTime="2438.728" offset="9899399">Now, this particular individual, for example, Mrs. Plasencia, has a U.S. citizen husband, four permanent resident children who were coming of military age, who were getting older.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.778" offset="9943598">Taking this family back to El Salvador might have given her, and a showing to the Court and proof to the Court that she has a fear of likelihood of returning to El Salvador with this family, might well have occasioned the immigration judge to grant a stay of deportation, but as the cases, and this Court is one of the decision-makers on that issue, that 243(h) does not apply to a person who is a respondent in exclusion proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.395" offset="10050073">So she would be precluded from making that application for, in the vernacular, asylum or refugee status.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.059" offset="10080689">Also, another preclusion would be Section 244(a)(1) and 244(d) of the Immigration and Nationality Act in that she could not apply for a suspension of deportation in an exclusion proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.308" offset="10133769">Again, the courts, this Court and other courts have found that that application could not be made in an exclusion proceeding by an excludee only by someone who is in deportation proceedings, and of course she could maybe very easily show that it would be extreme and unusual hardship to herself and her family to in fact return to El Salvador, a country in the middle of a civil war and great strife, and where maybe U.S. citizen men are not to be invited to remain, and permanent resident children are not going to be treated in a hospitable fashion, especially--</text>

            <text syncTime="2907.028" offset="11772587">It would in fact cause an easier situation for the immigration judge to present the conviction as evidence of excludability, and then we might have a little different... more difficulty with the government in arguing against them.</text>

            <text syncTime="2934.677" offset="11883242">The evidence was very contradictory, and they might have read the evidence, and they might have seen that this one witness, the number one witness in the case, in fact made contradictory statements the night before under oath in both cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.645" offset="11939040">She even misstated her name.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.655" offset="11947085">She misstated how much money supposedly was to be promised, $300 the night before, $250 the next morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.972" offset="11976343">She misstated the fact that it was the wife of her uncle that she was traveling with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.454" offset="11990344">In fact, during the hearing she says, I have no family.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.358" offset="12005913">So if you look at the contradictions of her evidence, I think the United States Attorney's office just decided that this would be a very difficult case to prosecute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.143" offset="12053038">I think I would like to draw finally the attention to the differences in exclusion and deportation proceedings and the particular prejudices to Mrs. Plasencia in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.151" offset="12101103">We have already talked about the stay of deportation, the notice of charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.105" offset="12116881">The continuances that are granted regularly in deportation proceedings, I think, are crucial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.340" offset="12145825">An immigration attorney must in fact prepare seven, ten, twelve, fifteen weeks, sometimes, for a case such as this, to be ready to argue it, and I would like to ask this Court to find that Mrs. Plasencia will be held in deportation proceedings, and that it will be the obligation of the government to prove her deportability, and I would ask this Court to not overturn Chew v. Colding.</text>

          <turn speaker="elliott_schulder" startTime="3070.906" stopTime="3321.600">
            <label>Mr. Elliott Schulder</label>
            <text syncTime="3070.906" offset="12428156">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.336" offset="12433799">Respondent has conceded here that greater procedural protections could be provided for resident aliens in exclusion proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.587" offset="12494821">I think it is quite apparent from Mr. Manulkin's argument that what Respondent really wants here is the opportunity to be eligible for a whole variety of discretionary forms of relief that are available to aliens only in a deportation context, and not in an exclusion context, but due process does not entitle an alien to these substantive forms of relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.297" offset="12609655">It is Congress and the statute that provides which aliens in which types of proceedings are entitled to certain substantive remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.912" offset="12648107">I think it is simply a distortion of the whole statutory scheme to allow resident aliens like Respondent to be placed in deportation proceedings where they will be given all kinds of substantive remedies that Congress specifically declined to give to these people when it separated exclusion proceedings from deportation proceedings in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.549" offset="12754687">I would also like to point out that Respondent's claims of inadequate notice and the other procedural deficiencies that she alleges are a red herring here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.098" offset="12804842">She could have raised these claims before the Board of Immigration Appeals, and in fact she was represented by counsel in a motion to reopen before the Board of Immigration Appeals, and if her claims had been rejected, she could have appealed to the Ninth Circuit and then to this Court raising the due process claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.179" offset="12877254">The fact of the matter is that she did not raise any of these claims either before the BIA or in the District Court or Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.274" offset="12909541">Finally, I think Justice O'Connor hit the nail on the head when she asked my adversary whether he conceded that where an alien has taken a trip of five years or of extended duration, whether he would still be arguing that there was an entitlement to a deportation proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.089" offset="13000865">Counsel conceded in response to that that there would not be such entitlement, but the whole point of this case is where and in what forum is the determination made as to whether the trip was brief or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.959" offset="13056349">In fact, the Ninth Circuit in a number of cases has held that fairly extensive trips abroad do not amount to extensive enough visits to interrupt permanent residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.359" offset="13121969">And I would like to make one final point in response to Respondent's argument relying on Kwong Hai Chew versus Colding, the language that a resident alien is to be assimilated to an alien continuously residing and physically present.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.200" offset="13193335">At Page 596 of Volume 344 of U.S. Reports, it is true that the Court said for purposes of his constitutional right to due process we assimilate petitioner's status to that of an alien continuously residing and physically present in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.354" offset="13265956">But several pages later, on page 601, the Court says, it may well be that an alien's ultimate right to remain in the United States is subject to alteration by statute or authorized regulation because of a voyage undertaken by him to foreign ports.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.693" offset="13335232">The point of our submission here is that the determination whether an alien is entitled to reenter the United States after a trip abroad is to be made in an exclusion setting, as Congress provided in the immigration statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.484" offset="13390403">The Ninth Circuit, and Respondent here, have provided absolutely no justification in law for departing from the statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.981" offset="13428437">Thank you--</text>
