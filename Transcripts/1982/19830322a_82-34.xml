            <label>Mr. Paul M. Bator</label>
            <text syncTime="95.728" offset="523680">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="99.602" offset="539144">This case involves the validity of two rules issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.754" offset="575820">Under Section 210 of the statute commonly known as PURPA, the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.452" offset="622631">The Government is here because the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia circuit held these rules invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.121" offset="653247">It is the submission of the Government that the Court of Appeals misread the statute, that the rules are valid, and that the ruling of that Court threatens to cripple an important and an exciting experiment that Congress set on when it enacted PURPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.676" offset="723464">I want to start by giving some background to put the arguments made in our brief and our reply brief in context.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.484" offset="758677">This Court is of course familiar with PURPA from its decision last term in FERC and Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.842" offset="788143">In PURPA Congress embarked on an ambitious attempt to encourage the development of innovative energy efficient technology for producing electric power.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.477" offset="834641">The central point was to lessen the country's dependance on foreign oil, to end the waste of nonrenewable fossil fuel, and to encourage energy efficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.190" offset="885528">More specifically, Congress sought to tap the tremendous reservoir of potential energy potentially available from renewable sources and from wasted heat produced in industrial and domestic settings.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.293" offset="949998">There are two technologies involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.511" offset="962850">Cogeneration is the simultaneous production of electricity on the one hand and thermal energy, heat and steam, on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.555" offset="999004">Small power production is the generation of relatively small amounts, less than 80 megawatts of electricity, from non-fossil fuel and renewable sources, wind, water, sun, organic materials, and waste.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.812" offset="1063996">Cogenerators and small power producers together are referred to as qualifying facilities, QF's for purposes of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.606" offset="1107151">In enacting PURPA, Congress found that cogeneration of small power production was hindered historically in this country by two things: the traditional electrical utilities, the interests represented by the Respondent here, sought to preserve their monopoly in the production of electricity by refusing to buy electricity from or selling back of electricity to QF's.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.734" offset="1219686">Secondly, an uneconomical and rigid regulatory environment deterred firms from entering the business of unconventional power production.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.777" offset="1259915">Behind these two labels, cogeneration and small power production, there is a world of hundreds of variagated technologies.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.180" offset="1301502">Cogenerators and small power producers come in all sizes and shapes from the $5,000 back-yard windmill producing maybe 10 kilowatts to the enormous paper mill generating maybe 300 to 400 kilowatts of power that may cost several hundred million dollars to build.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.343" offset="1386138">QF's use dozens of different fuels from walnut shells to garbage, from sawdust to geothermal brine.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.309" offset="1414037">Every facility that needs a fair amount of heat is a potential co-generator, every hospital, school, every laundry, every apartment house.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.867" offset="1452280">This is a wide-open road.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.819" offset="1468058">It is open to all comers.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.178" offset="1473492">It is exactly the opposite of the traditional monopolistic electric utility business.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.785" offset="1503898">Now, there are three critical elements in the congressional plan for encouraging cogeneration and small power production.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.891" offset="1544336">First, Section 210 of PURPA creates a legal obligation on utilities to buy to and sell from QF's.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.669" offset="1587490">Second, Congress instructed FERC to relieve QF's from the constricting regulatory environment that surrounded the commerce in electrical energy.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.491" offset="1642765">The third element in the congressional plan was decentralization.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.957" offset="1660633">The states are to play a critical role.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.096" offset="1673172">FERC was given one year to issue general framework rules to state the enterprise, to set it on foot.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.500" offset="1706818">Implementation was then to go forward at the state level.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.373" offset="1726253">I turn now to the first rule in question in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.058" offset="1749031">Here the commission addressed the question of what rate is to be paid by a utility buying power from a QF.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.195" offset="1785603">After extensive rule-making proceedings, FERC determined that a two-track system should be established.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.380" offset="1814338">Rates for old capacities, co-generators and small power producers already in existence or under construction, those rates were left on a flexible basis to state commissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.874" offset="1872225">The second track was for new capacities not yet in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.310" offset="1889988">It was, of course, here that the central PURPA purpose of encouraging new firms to come in was in play.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.400" offset="1918409">The rate system for new capacity was itself sub-divided into two tracks: one, rates could be set by negotiation in contracts at any level agreed to by the parties thus allowing the marked full play.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.127" offset="1989253">Two, if there is no contract, then a PURPA rate system comes into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.952" offset="2020600">The PURPA rate system is that the utility buying power from the QF must pay the QF the full avoided cost of that power.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.870" offset="2064277">Now, this is in turn subject both to state implementation and state waivers.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="488.367" stopTime="501.439">
            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="488.367" offset="2094266">Professor Bator, you put the other first and the full avoid cost second.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.395" offset="2122373">I must confess, having looked at the statute, I looked at it just the reverse.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_m_bator" startTime="501.439" stopTime="674.323">
            <label>Mr. Paul M. Bator</label>
            <text syncTime="501.439" offset="2146511">Well, Your Honor, if there had been a physical way to state them together simultaneously, I would have because they proceed in tandem.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.920" offset="2180470">Actually, in the regulations the very first thing in the regulations, the very first of the two, refers to the full play of negotiated and bargained-for rates, and it is later in Section 304 that we get the full avoided rate... full avoided cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.460" offset="2258628">I think it is important that there not be a misunderstanding about what the PURPA system and full avoided cost is because we think that the Court of Appeals really had a misunderstanding of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.595" offset="2311187">The Court of Appeals seemed to think that this was a very rigid, flat, single uniform rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.764" offset="2335846">Full avoided cost is not really a rate at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.872" offset="2352251">It is a rate system.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.841" offset="2356117">It is a dynamic rate structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.434" offset="2370537">It means simply that the amount paid by the utility to the QF equals the cost the utility would have incurred had that particular quantum of power not been available from the QF if it had to be produced by the utility.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.269" offset="2445874">Full avoided cost is simply the cost the utility avoided by having the QF power made available.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.858" offset="2480251">This means that full avoided cost is anything but rigid.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.170" offset="2497492">It varies from utility to utility.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.919" offset="2508463">It varies within each utility everytime fuel costs go up and down.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.136" offset="2525286">When OPEC puts down the price of oil, full avoided cost goes down because the power that would have had to have been produced by the utility would have been less.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.052" offset="2572933">Further, it is important to note that even when fuel prices are flat, full avoided cost varies because the unit cost of producing electricity is not uniform.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.235" offset="2625701">The more power a utility has to produce, the higher the unit cost to produce it.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.123" offset="2653286">It is a firm rule of utility practice that the most efficient, least-costly facilities are turned on first and are turned off last.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.242" offset="2705740">Thus, a utility may have coal, oil, gas-fired units.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.412" offset="2734475">At a time of low demand, the low-cost coal-fired units come on line.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.126" offset="2761329">If demand goes up, the next block of power comes in, the higher-priced fuel-oil-fired units.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.201" offset="2797587">At times of peak demand, the so-called peakers come on.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.732" offset="2815663">Those may be the very high-price natural-gas-fired units.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="674.323" offset="2838024">But is it not true, Mr. Bator, that at all times, even though the full avoided cost may be different at different times of the day and so forth, at all times, it is the maximum rate permitted by the statute?</text>

            <text syncTime="691.192" offset="2905525">Well, and at any given time of day, whatever that rate might be if it is equal to the utility's full avoided cost, it is the highest the statute would permit to be charged.</text>

          <turn speaker="paul_m_bator" startTime="702.907" stopTime="1077.427">
            <label>Mr. Paul M. Bator</label>
            <text syncTime="702.907" offset="2952440">But the actual price involved varies not only over these long ranges but will vary even within a given day.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.965" offset="2988594">At 3:00 a.m. when demand is very low, only the very low-cost facilities are on, and the price avoided by the utility is the low price.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.709" offset="3047631">At 7:00 p.m. when demand high, if there is QF power available, it would be replaced relatively high priced oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.688" offset="3083575">A QF that is supplying power over 16 or 24 hours a day... they all do... does not get just the peak price.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.405" offset="3118370">It gets the average price.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.717" offset="3123595">What this means is that full avoided cost, since it depends on the cost of the power it is replacing, it means that the first QF that comes along will always get the highest full avoided cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.568" offset="3191095">It is replacing the most expensive fuel.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.709" offset="3199663">The next one that comes along will be replacing the next block, less-costly capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.925" offset="3228502">The third one that comes along will be getting a lower price.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.703" offset="3251595">Really, the beauty of the system is that QF capacity replaces the least efficient utility capacity first, and the other beauty of the system is that the more QF power comes in, the lower the full avoided cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.430" offset="3330485">It drives down the full avoided cost because it will be replacing less and less costly utility capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.239" offset="3361727">Now, the Court of Appeals invalidated this rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.565" offset="3379072">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="810.080" offset="3381058">It did so because it found that the commission did not adequately take into account the interest of electrical utility consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.171" offset="3417420">The Court of Appeals evidently concluded that full avoided cost system would lead to excessive profits to QF's because cost savings would not be passed on immediately to utilities and their customers, and it concluded that this violated the statutory command that the rate be just and reasonable to consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.473" offset="3510625">Our submission, Your Honor, is that the Court of Appeals treading in an infinitely complicated and technical area entrusted to an expert commission really misapprehended the statute, misapprehended the commission's regulatory task under the statute, and certainly misunderstood the workings of the PURPA rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.435" offset="3598501">The Court of Appeals asserted that the statute requires basically that QF profits be limited so that all savings or a lot of savings could immediately pass through to customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.506" offset="3658791">Of course, this is traditional utility regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.349" offset="3670181">This is cost-of-service regulation in which the return to the seller is limited in terms of the seller's cost, but in this statute Congress made its intention clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.311" offset="3725978">As the conference report which is quoted at length in our reply brief makes clear, Congress did not wish these entities to be subjected to the cumbersome case-by-case cost-of-service regulation traditional in the utility business.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.757" offset="3791807">In other words, the commission rightly rejected cost-of-service rate making here as a solution because Congress had identified it as the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.488" offset="3834752">Rate-making pitched to QF cost is really in opposite in this industry for three reasons: the costs are an infinitely variagated set of costs associated with an incredibly complex and various form of technology and enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.417" offset="3914478">We are talking about future costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.213" offset="3925658">This is new capacity in a rapidly developing and a technologically very volatile field.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.991" offset="3952721">Most important, we are talking about an industry that is an at-risk open-to-all-comers industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.676" offset="3987516">It is fully competitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.252" offset="3993786">So that the problem of monopoly profits does not exist in this case, and it is in light of this clearly-expressed congressional purpose that FERC determined that rather than rates pitched to the seller's cost, an across-the-board rate set by rule in advance was necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.195" offset="4101515">Now, to return to Justice Stevens: why start it at 100 percent of avoided cost?</text>
            <text syncTime="995.802" offset="4123980">Why not some lower figure?</text>
            <text syncTime="998.224" offset="4133698">The Court of Appeals suggested that might show a savings in some way with utility customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.736" offset="4163686">Our answer is that the cost had to be set in advance in a world of uncertainty under a statute whose principal purpose was to entice entrants, new firms, into the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.886" offset="4220320">Now, from this advanced perspective, this whole picture of savings and excess profits is very misleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.679" offset="4255533">You don't know in advance what the costs of that new QF are going to be.</text>

            <text syncTime="1153.926" offset="4756457">Finally, the Court of Appeals picture of savings here is misleading because it simply forgets the self-correcting nature of full avoided cost.</text>

            <text syncTime="2475.533" offset="10042909">In PURPA Section 210 which has the rate provision in it, Congress authorized the commission to exempt co-generators from certain provisions of the Power Act, but it said,</text>

            <text syncTime="2500.398" offset="10142383">He has to show the validity of his rule in light of 210(e)(3)(b), the non-exemption provision, and if he does, he must establish nonetheless that there is implicit authority in PURPA to order interconnection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.253" offset="10201838">I suggest to you that the Government's argument really is illogical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.500" offset="10226811">The Government contends correctly that Congress knew all along that there must be interconnection authority, and then it goes on and says, "Congress confers this authority implicitly", though indeed the Congress did know that there had to be interconnection authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.775" offset="10291908">It provided that interconnection authority in the Federal Power Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2748.537" offset="11134932">The Government certainly implies that if we prevail, we will be setting... we will be requiring all of these thousands of small windmills that Mr. Bator very vividly talks about.</text>

            <text syncTime="2776.041" offset="11244960">The statute certainly says that interconnection proceedings ought to be treated as adjudicatory proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.880" offset="11280277">It references the APA sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.301" offset="11293965">To my mind, Justice Stevens, that shows that Congress was very concerned about these types of proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.034" offset="11324894">It does now follow, however, that simply because these are adjudicatory proceedings that you must have thousands of proceedings before the FERC.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.465" offset="11362615">I am reminded of this Court's decision in Weinberger v. Heinsen, also an adjudicatory situation, where I believe Justice Rehnquist was writing for the Court, and he said that even in that situation when you use your rule-making authority to establish general rules, to establish congressional requirements, if Mr. Bator is correct that the overwhelming majority of interconnections will not present issues worthy of adjudicatory proceedings, then we submit that the commission can take care of that by using its rule-making authority by directing a threshold variable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.060" offset="11512976">What it may not do is to prevent a utility which believes it has the capacity to overcome that threshold showing from any opportunity to come before it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2868.331" offset="11614122">I suggest that if you look at Chairman Curtis's testimony, if you recognize that he was addressing legislation which at that time said that co-generators can obtain interconnections... rather that distribution interconnections were available under the cogeneration provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.978" offset="11708685">When you recognize that he said that was not going to be the vehicle because we are dealing with transmission facilities, please enact the Federal Power Act interconnection provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.865" offset="11756228">That shows that the Government is flatly wrong in making the voltage-level distinction it tries to make between transmission and distribution facilities.</text>

            <text syncTime="2919.967" offset="11820594">This Court has held facilities as low as 12 kilovolts in the City of Colton case to be transmission facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.151" offset="11857374">Conversely, it has held slightly larger facilities, 13.8 kilovolts to be distribution facilities in the Connecticut Light and Power case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.069" offset="11893005">Why is that?</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.725" offset="11895722">The reason for that is that is not a voltage level distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.129" offset="11909306">It's a functional distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.519" offset="11918814">When power is being shipped to an ultimate consumer and it is going in one direction when a utility controls the flow of it, can protect its system, can protect its other customers, that is a distribution facility, but when someone who is not under the control of the utility unilaterally controls the flow of power into a utility system, when it is a two-way flow, and that is what the commission's rules require... it requires parallel operation... then you are dealing with transmission facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.178" offset="12045456">Congress recognized that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.974" offset="12052666">It recognized the transmission facilities present unique problems, and it dealt with those unique problems comprehensively in the 210 provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.627" offset="12095298">Remember, in the 210 Federal Power Act provision, Congress included from the very inception co-generators, small power producers, those little guys who were going to produce less than 80 megawatts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.450" offset="12146602">Congress included them because it recognized the potential for reliability problems, and it recognized that was a non-delegable Federal interest that FERC could not abdicate its responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.397" offset="12202400">Now, let me say a word about 210(e)(3)(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.004" offset="12224760">Congress has just finished writing 210 of the Federal Power Act through all of the things that I have just described.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.719" offset="12263631">Why did it put in 210(e)(3)(b)?</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.795" offset="12275960">It put in 210(e)(3)(b) in conference at the same time it put in a savings clause in the Federal Power Act, 210(12)(e) and at the same time it put in the necessary-to-encourage language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.088" offset="12325175">Why do they do that?</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.727" offset="12335729">What's the logical explanation?</text>

            <text syncTime="3050.883" offset="12344297">Well, the fair reading was that Congress simply did not want the commission to undo what it carefully crafted in the Federal Power Act interconnection provision, and that's why it put in 210(e)(3)(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.485" offset="12410752">The Government in its reply brief repeats one argument that the commission had offered and then offers two new arguments that hadn't been made before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.214" offset="12457668">First it contends that there is really a target applicant distinction, that 210(e)(3)(b) is intended to exempt co-generators when they are targets, but you cannot exempt them from being targets for interconnection orders, and it points out that when you exempt somebody, you exempt them from an obligation, from a duty, from a burden.</text>

            <text syncTime="3157.934" offset="12772496">Indeed, the whole purpose of putting 212 in the Federal Power Act is to impose burdens on those who are applicants for interconnection orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.289" offset="12813978">Secondly, the Government implies that co-generators were included as targets for the first time in conference when (e)(3)(b) was added.</text>

            <text syncTime="3196.903" offset="12928395">Finally, in a footnote to its reply brief, the Government contends that (e)(3)(b) talks about facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.414" offset="12962458">When discussing cogenerators as targets, they talk about them as facilities, and that, it implies, buttresses its target-applicant distinction.</text>

            <text syncTime="3232.763" offset="13071859">Carried to its logical extreme, it would mean that the barrier... the barrier that Congress was determined to pull down, the barrier of regulations, would remain because under (e)(1) the commission could not relieve owners, operators.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.833" offset="13148137">The Public Utility Holding Company Act is not addressed to facilities.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul M. Bator</label>
            <text syncTime="3273.543" offset="13234968">Yes, Chief Justice, just a few comments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.823" offset="13248029">The question raised by Mr. Berlin about the legal obligation under the rules of the utilities to enter into the long-term arrangements, I would like to complicate it in a tricky reading of these rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.001" offset="13324829">We believe and the Government submits that it requires an enormous torture process to be done to the language to those rules to lead to the conclusion that the utilities have a long-term obligation or have an obligation to enter into long-term contracts with QF's.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.839" offset="13396091">The simple reading and the straightforward reading of the statute is that in the absence of using the PURPA system you simply... each side is wholly free to bargain or not to bargain to a long-term contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.740" offset="13459725">On the long-term-saving question, Justice Stevens, on Mr. Berlin's account of this statute, it would be totally inexplicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.016" offset="13496819">Why fix the utilities so they will be unable since the PURPA rate went into effect to obtain long-term contracts at less than fully avoided cost?</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.636" offset="13547288">The reason that long-term saving will inure to the customer is the commission's rules explicitly provide that the availability of QF power as it comes into play should be taken in account, should be factored into the calculation of fully avoided cost.</text>

            <text syncTime="3373.955" offset="13636627">I think I understand your argument, but I am not entirely sure the commission made that argument.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul M. Bator</label>
            <text syncTime="3377.501" offset="13650733">Well, they put it in the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.734" offset="13659719">Rule 292.304(e)(6) says to the states, "Factor it in".</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.779" offset="13687931">The commission did explicitly say the other thing which is that the existence of the PURPA rate would pit both parties into negotiation, and that is what it has done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.649" offset="13739340">And that has already... we don't even have to wait for the long term.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.460" offset="13754596">Customers have already realized savings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.178" offset="13769538">Finally, on this one, the commission explicitly made a relevant modest disavowal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.268" offset="13797854">They said,</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.643" offset="13799317">"This rulemaking presents an effort to evolve concept in a newly-developing area. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.094" offset="13829201">That is not our invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.155" offset="13837351">That's what the commission said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.560" offset="13847069">Now, on the interconnection question, Mr. Berlin makes light of the obligations that would be imposed if every interconnection had to start with a Section 210 Power Act proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.680" offset="13903493">My only response to that, Your Honor, is to sit down and read Section 210 of the Power Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.396" offset="13926377">It requires an absolutely full evidentiary hearing, a complete set of public-interest findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.596" offset="13955111">Substantial evidence must support all of these findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.687" offset="13983533">There is an absolutely overwhelming process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.968" offset="13992623">The two statues, the Power Act and PURPA, are the product of an enormously complicated and untidy legislative process, and all I have time for is to beg the Court to understand that there were two very different things going on at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.991" offset="14072767">The Power Act was dealing with a different range of problems, and it is really just sort of an unhappy coincidence that there is a kind of surface plausibility to injecting this totally inapposite Power Act proceeding into the middle of every PURPA interconnection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.233" offset="14157717">It makes no sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.528" offset="14162837">It makes absolutely no sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.198" offset="14177570">For these reasons and the reasons stated in our brief, we ask that the judgment of the Court of Appeals be reversed.</text>
