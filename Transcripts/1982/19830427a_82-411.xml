            <text syncTime="7.854" offset="165097">Mr. Kramer, I think you may proceed when you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew M. Kramer</label>
            <text syncTime="49.805" offset="332908">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="52.355" offset="343148">The Court today is revisiting an area that it has visited in such cases as Geduldig v. Aiello, General Electric Company v. Gilbert, Nashville Gas Company v. Satty, and to a somewhat lesser degree, the decision of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power v. Manhart.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.816" offset="412947">Unlike those cases, however, the claim of discrimination here is not being brought on behalf of female employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.297" offset="446906">This case involves male employees and the question of what benefits are to be provided their spouses for hospitalization costs incurred as a result of childbirth.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.450" offset="487448">In deciding this question the Court for the first time is asked to analyze the scope of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, an act passed as a direct result of this Court's decision in Gilbert.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.632" offset="540215">The Shipyard in this case has a comprehensive group health insurance plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.691" offset="560486">The plan covers employees, their spouses, and unmarried children up to the age of 19 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.813" offset="588908">Prior to the passage of the PDA, the Shipyard covered female employees and the spouses of male employees identically with respect to pregnancy hospitalization costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.981" offset="637600">Under that plan, the Shipyard provided hospitalization costs incurred as a result of normal childbirth of up to $500 with full prenatal expenses taken care of, physician and anesthesiologist costs, and major medical coverage in the event of pregnancy complications.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.331" offset="715027">As a result of the PDA, however, the Shipyard removed the $500 cap with respect to its female employees, but retained the cap with respect to the spouses of its male employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.640" offset="764241">It is the failure to remove this cap which the Government alleges constitutes intentional compensation discrimination against male employees under Section 703(a) of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.306" offset="818890">At the outset it's important to note that the Government's position here has not been a model of consistency, indeed has been ever-changing.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.990" offset="857655">When Congress considered the PDA, Drew Days, then Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, and the Deputy General Counsel of the EEOC testified in House hearings, pursuant to a question, that they did not believe that the PDA was intended to govern the question of dependents or their coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.404" offset="931321">The EEOC, when it promulgated its very question and answers dealing with the issue of dependent coverage for male employees, stated that the issue was not resolved by the PDA, but rather had to be resolved under existing Title VII principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.007" offset="997776">We contend, as submitted in our briefs, that both the language of the statute and its legislative history show that the PDA itself does not govern this issue, and that the PDA itself does not make this Shipyard's insurance plan unlawful on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.999" offset="1069665">In amending Title VII with respect to the PDA, Congress did not add a new substantive provision or make it a new separate act, but rather chose to amend the definitional section, and added as a definition under Section 701, 701(k), the first clause of which reads</text>
            <text syncTime="256.773" offset="1160780">"that the terms because of sex or on the basis of sex include, but are not limited to, because of on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions. "</text>
            <text syncTime="267.829" offset="1204979">Except for the Fourth Circuit in the Instant case, all other courts which have construed this language have interpreted this provision to be simply definitional, and that it must be read into the substantive provisions of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.121" offset="1266210">Indeed, Drew Days in the same testimony that he gave to the House as Assistant Attorney General in support of the PDA noted that in fact on pages 171 and I believe 172 of the House hearings that in fact what Congress was doing with those terms was putting them into the substantive provisions of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.409" offset="1347294">If Congress had felt otherwise, it is curious why Congress would have put the terms</text>
            <text syncTime="308.610" offset="1368088">"because of sex or on the basis of sex. "</text>
            <text syncTime="311.077" offset="1378014">in quotation marks, since those terms, while not the specific language, but the terms 703 of Title VII, which are the very sections requiring employers, labor organizations, other individuals to take certain affirmative steps with respect to equal opportunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="345.362" offset="1515105">And let me ask you whether you think it would be a violation of Title VII for an employer to furnish medical coverage for wives of employees but not for husbands.</text>

          <turn speaker="andrew_m_kramer" startTime="367.352" stopTime="377.192">
            <label>Mr. Andrew M. Kramer</label>
            <text syncTime="367.352" offset="1603086">--I think that's a Title VII sex discrimination claim, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.194" offset="1614475">And I think clearly there are cases... in fact, cases prior to Gilbert... dealing with spousal benefits where--</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="377.192" offset="1642478">Well, if that's so, then how does this case differ?</text>
            <text syncTime="381.033" offset="1657838">I mean you can forget the pregnancy problem and just tell me how this differs from that situation.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_m_kramer" startTime="386.968" stopTime="756.428">
            <label>Mr. Andrew M. Kramer</label>
            <text syncTime="386.968" offset="1681557">--Because the Government says that on its face, Your Honor, in this case we are required to provide, even where we provide spousal benefits to the spouses of males... males and females, that we have an additional affirmative obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.025" offset="1741848">If we provide those benefits, we must also provide for hospitalization benefits for pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.194" offset="1766508">As in this case, hospitalization benefits happen to be provided to a substantial degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.754" offset="1788764">The Government says that degree isn't enough because the PDA requires you to cover it fully.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.097" offset="1810080">Our position is that doesn't violate Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.313" offset="1822932">The employees' compensation is the same in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.578" offset="1835993">There is no showing in this record that a male employee is receiving less compensation than his female counterpart.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.247" offset="1858668">Now, the Government's position is not the one you articulated, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.418" offset="1875386">The Government's position is not having to do with providing one sex or the other no benefits or some benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.508" offset="1903703">The Government's position is if you provide equal benefits, as we contend are provided with respect to pregnancy, you have to provide additional coverage, additional risk coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.114" offset="1942155">And I think that's... but we would believe that you look to Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.190" offset="1958455">We're not contending this isn't a Title VII case.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.503" offset="1967755">We're simply saying it's not governed by the PDA.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.673" offset="1976428">In fact, interestingly enough, Your Honor, if you take a look at the second clause of the PDA, which we believe amplifies congressional intent, it also to some degree answers your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.981" offset="2017597">That clause says,</text>
            <text syncTime="472.887" offset="2025224">"Women affected by pregnancy shall be treated the same for fringe benefit purposes or employment-related purposes, including the receipt of fringe benefits, as other persons not so affected but similar in their ability and inability to work. "</text>
            <text syncTime="489.162" offset="2090321">The Government would have us believe that for the first time Congress has made an express mandate in Title VII that the term "other persons" and "women affected" are not terms limited to employees or applicants to employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.657" offset="2152284">For the first time Congress, according to the Government, has revolutionized Title VII by directly affecting spousal behavior or employer obligations with respect to spouses and dependents.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.212" offset="2202543">We contend, Your Honor, that the PDA cannot be read that way; that the PDA in terms of a logical document within Title VII itself and its legislative history cannot support that.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.350" offset="2247056">Now, what is remaining, however, is the question of... and by the way, it's cited in both briefs; they're replete with references to the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.110" offset="2294181">And I would just note when deciding Gilbert, the Court noted that the legislative history with respect to the sex discrimination ban original in Title VII was relatively sparse.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.777" offset="2332842">I would contend with all the documents that are cited in the brief, the legislative history with respect to the PDA was anything but sparse.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.259" offset="2362726">And that in fact Congress clearly evidenced its concern that this Court's decision in Gilbert operated as a direct barrier to women workers in the work force.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.629" offset="2408179">And the second clause was put in, I believe, and if one reads the legislative history by Congress, for the fact that Gilbert was more than one holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.047" offset="2441930">Gilbert did not just go off on gender.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.983" offset="2453632">Gilbert also went off on the question of whether or not there was discriminatory effects, whether the given health insurance plan in that case actually provided more or less benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.245" offset="2498668">The evidence as found in the record in that case was that women were receiving... that is, the case of Gilbert... that women were receiving more benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.008" offset="2529701">Well, interestingly enough, the second clause says whether or not the value is equal, Mr. Employer, you have a comprehensive program, you have to provide it.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.784" offset="2572855">I would contend that the similarity between a female spouse of a male employee and the working woman that Congress was concerned about when it passed the PDA are entirely dissimilar, and the individuals are not only similarly situated, but the individuals and the policy considerations with respect to them are quite varied and distinct.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.791" offset="2656865">The hearings on the PDA in fact emphasized this fact... the cost added... that is now relied upon by the Government so extensively in its brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.553" offset="2691869">It is interesting to me that the Government in its brief cites the Senate report indicating... and this is at pages 32 and 33 of the Government's brief, Note 32... indicating support for the proposition that Congress in considering the cost of the PDA obviously considered the cost of both dependents as well as employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.388" offset="2779223">And it cites the fact that the Senate report in a footnote noted that it found certain plans to be perfectly legal and other plans to be discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.633" offset="2820183">And it said in their brief that those plans encompass both employees, dependents and spouses.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.162" offset="2846305">The Government, however, forgot to add the following words that fit in that footnote:</text>
            <text syncTime="682.599" offset="2864068">"What percentage of women employees are covered by such discriminatory plans cannot be calculated. "</text>
            <text syncTime="690.283" offset="2894788">The focus of Congress when it came to cost, when it came to concern as to why there was a need for the PDA, was not male employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.170" offset="2930419">The Senate report expressly noted that the issue of dependent coverage of male employees would have to be decided not on the basis of the PDA but on existing Title VII principles... a position earlier adopted by the EEOC but subsequently changed during the course of this and other litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.755" offset="3012757">Now the... and one other point I would make.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.910" offset="3029371">One significant colloquy during the Senate debates occurred between Senators Hatch and Senator Williams.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.610" offset="3056121">Senator Williams, of course, was the chairman of the committee having primary responsibility for the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.124" offset="3078168">Senator Williams was probably the primary sponsor and member of the Senate's conference committee team.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.902" offset="3097290">Senator Williams was asked directly by Senator Hatch whether if the terms "women affected by pregnancy" only refers to employees and no... or women employees and no one else.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.570" offset="3147967">Senator Williams said "Exactly".</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew M. Kramer</label>
            <text syncTime="784.291" offset="3270847">Well, our emphatic reliance is because I think it's a pretty direct quote on the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.570" offset="3291954">I think with respect to applicants, whether Senator Hatch considered them to be having a nexus in the employment process or not, I'm not sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.067" offset="3321943">But it seems to me clearly the first clause governs applicants, because the first clause directly goes into 703(a)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="803.846" offset="3349110">703(a)(2) by its very terms speaks not just with respect to employees but of applicants for employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.923" offset="3373352">So regardless of whether or not the mandate... and by the way, it is possible, Your Honor, that the second clause does not in fact cover applicants, since applicants would probably never enjoy a disability or fringe benefit until they became an employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.182" offset="3426432">So I think Senator Williams might have given the exact answer with respect to that clause, since that clause is specifically tied to fringe benefits, something that would normally not be enjoyed by an applicant.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.974" offset="3481603">I think then the critical question for the Court is what principles should the Court apply and what are the principles if the PDA doesn't govern, because we have a Title VII case.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.796" offset="3532908">We have a case where Congress has expressly rejected, at least in part, the notion that pregnancy should be unprotected with respect to Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.651" offset="3572300">So the question is what remains, and how do we fashion in this case a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.492" offset="3599677">Well, first of all, I think it's important to recognize that this Court has never held that pregnancy classifications are without protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.239" offset="3634681">What this Court has held in cases such as Satty, and in Gilbert, is that pregnancy classifications on its face is not per se discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.017" offset="3677730">In Gilbert there were at least two concurring Justices who noted, in fact, that their concurrences were on the basis that it was not a per se violation and that therefore the Government had the burden, or in that case private plaintiffs, of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.837" offset="3741051">Now, the Government here, interestingly enough, in its complaint alleges not a violation of 701(k), but rather alleges a violation of 703(a) of Title VII, and most specifically the compensation provisions of 703(a)(1), and goes on to allege intentional discrimination, of which there is absolutely no proof in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.875" offset="3841152">So what do we have from the principles of this Court that can be applied to resolve this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="933.904" offset="3869365">First, this Court has recognized, as I said before, that the issue was not simply whether pregnancy is made a classifying factor, but whether discrimination has occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.727" offset="3904578">The Court has never held that a limitation or exclusion of pregnancy itself constitutes a per se violation of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.459" offset="3935507">As shown in such cases as Gilbert, Satty and Manhart, there is a need for a plaintiff to show that there is in fact a difference in compensation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1000.595" offset="4136127">And we put an example... for an example, because I think this ties in to how the Court evolved from Gilbert; it went from Gilbert to Satty... where, for example, Justice Powell in his concurring opinion in a footnote noted he thought Gilbert dealt with the question of equality of compensation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1100.319" offset="4534965">Congress felt that portions of the Satty decision were in fact consistent with what they were doing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1111.003" offset="4577701">What I'm contending here is the Government in this case alleged intentional discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.766" offset="4600793">They didn't allege the PDA per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.531" offset="4607794">They alleged under Section 703(a), intentional discrimination, of which, Your Honor, there is no proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.248" offset="4630677">The Shipyard's insurance program covers a number of risks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.511" offset="4651784">It also includes a number of risks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.213" offset="4662547">As in the case of pregnancy benefit, it limits certain coverage of certain risks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.852" offset="4685117">As recognized in Manhart, when insurance risks are grouped, the better risk always subsidizes the poorer ones, the healthy versus the unhealthy, the single versus the married, the individual with smaller family size will subsidize the individuals with larger family size.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.796" offset="4756901">The monetary value of this plan is perceived by the Government and the court below to essentially be the fact that Mr. McNulty had to go into his pocket, pull out some money because of the fact that this plan only covered pregnancy for $500 for hospital expenses, but as shown in the appendix, certain individuals received far more because the plan is more generous than just $500, and that a female employee with a spouse would never have to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.222" offset="4882602">Well, it's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.595" offset="4888036">A female employee with a spouse probably never has to face the risk of pregnancy for that spouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.296" offset="4910919">That is clearly true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.515" offset="4915726">But the plan being offered here covers risk identically.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.044" offset="4933907">The same plan that Mr. McNulty has is the same one given to a female employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.465" offset="4955536">The risk coverage and the benefit coverage of these plans are equal except for one fact: when it comes to the spousal component of this plan, male employees with pregnant spouses are covered for an additional risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.069" offset="5009975">The $1,000 that someone alleges in the appendix he already received for pregnancy benefits is a $1,000 that some other group of employee is subsidizing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.813" offset="5052921">Pregnancy in this case is an additional covered risk under this plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.514" offset="5075804">Now, does that mean that Mr. McNulty got more compensation?</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.576" offset="5095970">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.091" offset="5098060">The value of the plan is as to the risks that are covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.714" offset="5112584">They will fall regardless of sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.197" offset="5122511">Some will be sex-related... a vasectomy in the case of a male... but there's probably a comparable situation with respect to a female.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.523" offset="5155739">Those things will fall not because of sex per se, but because of factors of illness, age and health.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.753" offset="5188757">Unlike the Fourteenth Amendment cases so heavily relied upon by at least the AFL-CIO in its amicus brief and the Government to some degree in its own brief, those cases, to us, have no application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.826" offset="5249048">First of all, Frontiero was expressly distinguished by this Court in Geduldig v. Aiello, as well as Reed v. Reed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.447" offset="5283530">But more importantly, first of all, there was either a total denial of benefits in those cases, such as the hypothetical Justice O'Connor gave, or the individuals were... not only a total denial, but the individuals were similarly situated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.566" offset="5339954">Here, I would strongly contend that the individual employee and the individual spouse, female employee, female spouse, are not similarly situated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.061" offset="5381959">The EEOC's position with respect to this case cannot be given any weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.355" offset="5411112">First of all, it's been an ever-changing position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.074" offset="5421979">They now look to, in the appendix, letters sent of Senator Javits to support what might be existing Title VII principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.616" offset="5456147">This can only be analogous to private correspondence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.100" offset="5470148">There is no reference by Senator Javits on the floor debates of which he participated, nor is there any reference by Senator Javits or any other member of the committee in the committee report to this correspondence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.938" offset="5521453">And interestingly enough, the Court might pay attention to the first letter that was sent to Senator Javits, since in that letter the Commission said under their view Title VII would be satisfied if an employer simply provided the female employee the same medical cost benefit as the male spouse... a position which Congress did not adopt, but equally a position that the Shipyard was in prior to passage of the PDA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.490" offset="5631690">The policies behind Title VII are not being vindicated by the Government's position in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.018" offset="5665753">Since the PDA requires or gives an employer an option to reduce benefits to come into compliance, the employer, assuming the Court found the violation, could then choose to reduce benefits which go to all employees regardless of sex, and would take away benefits when we're only talking about in this case an additional risk, a risk that is already being covered.</text>

            <text syncTime="1422.517" offset="5823742">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.813" offset="5840983">First, I want to summarize briefly our theory of the case which is based on our reading of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act as establishing that discrimination based on pregnancy is discrimination based on sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.180" offset="5902423">Having done that, I will then discuss why we believe that is the correct way to read the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.522" offset="5927814">Title VII requires that employees must be paid without discrimination on the basis of sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.613" offset="5956130">Fringe benefits are part of that pay, including, of course, insurance plans that reimburse employees for their family medical expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.202" offset="5998553">An employer cannot offer its male employees less health insurance than its female employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.886" offset="6029273">Therefore, an insurance plan that provides less generous coverage to male employees for their families than is provided to female employees for their families violates Title VII, because on its face it discriminates between male and female employees on the basis of sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.785" offset="6112865">That principle, we submit, is the one that was established in cases like Frontiero, Wiesenfeld and Wengler.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.423" offset="6147347">For example--</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="1505.530" offset="6155810">So even without the Pregnancy Disability Act you take the position that it's covered under Title VII?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harriet_s_shapiro" startTime="1512.403" stopTime="1920.658">
            <label>Ms. Harriet S. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="1512.403" offset="6183291">--Well, only if the discrimination based on sex is discrimination based on... I mean discrimination based on pregnancy is discrimination based on sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.537" offset="6235850">For example, a plan that covers 25 days of hospitalization for husbands but only 20 days for wives would violate Title VII, because male employees, the only ones who have wives, would get smaller fringe benefits than female employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.062" offset="6305962">But a plan that covered 25 days for sons and 20 days for daughters wouldn't violate Title VII, because both male and female employees may have daughters, so that plan would affect male and female employees equally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.149" offset="6370328">A plan that singles out spousal pregnancies and provides less generous coverage for them than for other dependent medical expenses has precisely the same effect as an express limitation on benefits for wives and violates Title VII for precisely the same reason if distinctions based on pregnancy are distinctions based on sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.171" offset="6466354">We submit that that's what the PDA was enacted to establish.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.013" offset="6485789">The plain language of the statute supports that view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.088" offset="6510031">The Pregnancy Discrimination Act amended the general definition section of Title VII, providing expressly that discriminations because of pregnancy are discriminations because of sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.865" offset="6561126">Nothing in the language of the statute suggests that general principle applies only to female employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.626" offset="6588189">Indeed, in explaining the effect of the new definition, the statute says that women affected by pregnancy, not female employees affected by pregnancy, shall be treated the same for all employment-related purposes, including fringe benefits, as other persons, not employees, not so affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.524" offset="6675752">If Congress had intended to limit the new definition to women employees, it surely would not have referred to... it would have referred to employees instead of to women and persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.144" offset="6730295">Petitioner argues that "because of pregnancy" is simply to be read into the substantive provisions that prohibit discrimination on the basis of such individual sex, but that substitution argument is unpersuasive for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.263" offset="6798736">First, it turns Title VII into a statute that requires special treatment for women workers, although the fundamental purpose of Title VII has always been to provide for the equality of treatment of all workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.958" offset="6865505">And it's particularly significant that in enacting the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, Congress emphasized that it was not intended to change the basic principles of Title VII law regarding sex discrimination, and also that it was not intended to require special benefits for women workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.168" offset="6962367">Second, petitioner's argument assumes that Congress meant to say that the denial of benefits for pregnancies of female workers was sex-based, while the denial of benefits for the pregnancies of spouses was gender neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.956" offset="7037495">And that's not the kind of common sense view of pregnancy that Congress said that it was enacting in the Pregnancy Discrimination Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.204" offset="7070514">Third, petitioner is asking for a narrowly literal reading of the first clause of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, but such a narrow literal reading makes no sense, because, in fact, the substantive provisions of Title VII nowhere contain the precise phrase "because of sex" or "on the basis of sex".</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.849" offset="7169048">So there... if you read it as literally as he wishes us to, there is nowhere to substitute the new language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.908" offset="7201335">Finally, even if you can read an ellipsis into the statute, the substitution approach would mean that only the federal government would be precluded from limiting spousal pregnancy benefits, because only Section 717 of Title VII, which applies to the federal government, prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex rather than on the basis of such individual's sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.381" offset="7307183">Turning to the second clause, petitioner has never attempted to explain the reference to women and persons rather than employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.425" offset="7351383">Instead, he focuses on the reference to</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.095" offset="7366116">"similar in their ability or inability to work. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.391" offset="7379281">and argues that that phrase must be read as a restriction of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act to female employees, as if it read</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.591" offset="7412091">"similar in their ability or inability to work for the particular employer involved. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.323" offset="7431004">Of course, it doesn't say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.682" offset="7440408">We submit that in context that phrase must be read as a functional description of the way pregnancy is to be treated, like any other condition that affects a person's ability to do whatever work she normally performs, whether that's housework or any other work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.486" offset="7511670">Indeed, the legislative history shows that a major aim of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act is to require that pregnancy be treated like any other functionally comparable disabling condition.</text>

            <text syncTime="1861.166" offset="7578334">I'd like to turn now to the legislative history, particularly the discussion in the Senate report of the effect of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act's amendment of Title VII on medical benefits for dependents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.301" offset="7642909">That discussion recognizes that at some future date the kind of question now involved in this case may arise; that is, whether an employer health insurance plan that covers dependents of employees may limit pregnancy coverage for those dependents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.294" offset="7714903">Instead of providing a direct answer to that question, the report says that it is to be decided by applying existing Title VII principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.993" offset="7757639">We submit that that means Title VII principles as clarified by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.335" offset="7787001">You don't have to look very far for a concise summary of some of those principles.</text>

            <text syncTime="1980.994" offset="8057629">I think it's also significant, though, that even if you say it meant existing at the day they were speaking, what they thought were existing Title VII principles, in fact, in that... that... the discussion of the medical benefits is at pages 5... page 5 of the legislative history, 5 and 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.032" offset="8141848">But then at page 3 of the... I mean of the Senate report... on page 3 of the Senate report, just a few pages before, there's a section that is entitled "The Basic Principles".</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.434" offset="8191481">And that section starts out, it says,</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.933" offset="8201407">"This bill is intended to make plain that under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 discrimination based on pregnancy, childbirth and related medical conditions is discrimination based on sex. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.395" offset="8259294">"Thus, the bill defines "sex discrimination" as prescribed in the existing statute to include those physiological occurrences peculiar to women. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.752" offset="8304748">"It does not change the application of Title VII to sex discrimination in any other way. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.170" offset="8326377">"By defining sex discrimination to include discrimination against pregnant women, the bill rejects the view that employers may treat pregnancy and its incidence as sui generis without regard to the functional... functional comparability to other conditions. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.446" offset="8387503">Now, if they were saying apply Gilbert, Gilbert says pregnancy is sui generis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.208" offset="8418537">Congress didn't... was saying in the... precisely in the Pregnancy Discrimination Act don't treat pregnancy as sui generis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.421" offset="8459392">So I think that it's fairly clear from the entire legislative history that what the PDA was intended to do was to establish at least two principles, and these principles the Congress indeed had thought were always part of Title VII: first, that pregnancy discrimination is sex discrimination; and second, that pregnancy may not be treated as sui generis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.709" offset="8572555">Those principles, together with the fundamental pre-existing Title VII principles not affected by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, that neither sex is to be favored over the other and that health insurance benefits for dependents are compensation for the employee, are the principles to be applied here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.389" offset="8651236">There's no basis in the legislative history for petitioner's claim that the reference to existing Title VII principles was an invitation to the courts to apply the rationale of Gilbert to spousal pregnancy benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.384" offset="8711213">The legislative history is in fact remarkably consistent in rejecting the rationale of Gilbert.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.865" offset="8737126">The reason for the enactment of the Pregnancy Discrimination was to adopt the rationale of the dissenters in Gilbert, and that pregnancy discrimination is, on its face, sex discrimination for all Title VII purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.641" offset="8796268">Petitioner has claimed that the EEOC and the Government have been inconsistent in their interpretations of the effect of Title VII on... and the Pregnancy Discrimination Act on spousal pregnancies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.850" offset="8881113">In fact, the EEOC has been inconsistent throughout.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.113" offset="8910161">I think petitioner's problem probably is that they see the... the Pregnancy Discrimination Act as somehow in conflict with Title VII, whereas in fact it is an amendment of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.263" offset="8978707">Congress consistently said that it was... that Title VII... that it was to be interpreted harmoniously and that they were not intending to put in through the Pregnancy Discrimination Act anything that would require special treatment for women employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.505" offset="9055716">The discussion of why the petitioner believes that compensation is the same is also answered by the legislative history, the Senate report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.247" offset="9134710">In talking about medical benefits in terms of the applicability to female employees, the Senate report says,</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.304" offset="9190926">"Discrimination against female employees in medical plans by excluding pregnancy coverage has, of course, precisely the same impact as discrimination in disability plans. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.065" offset="9237946">"A woman who is obliged to apply her own income to doctor and hospital bills although male employees are not is obviously earning less for the same work. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.701" offset="9280473">Our submission is simply that the same thing applies to male employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.777" offset="9308790">So that as far as the equality of costs and the... argument that... and, again, petitioner is simply asking this Court to apply Gilbert even though, as we submit, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act has said that the principles to be applied are those of the dissenters in Gilbert rather than of Gilbert... the Gilbert majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.857" offset="9437103">Finally, the petitioner claims that the EEOC didn't... did not... well, that the EEOC alleged intentional discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.022" offset="9489766">I think that is simply incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.412" offset="9503350">The complaint on the Joint Appendix at page 30 is... and the paragraph 11 states simply that the petitioner has discriminated and is discriminating against its male employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.560" offset="9587987">It doesn't say anything about intentional discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.761" offset="9608780">And, clearly, our submission is that the discrimination is facial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.618" offset="9636157">The... finally, the... the Javits correspondence to which petitioner refers we think is quite significant precisely because the... this was the statement by the officials who were responsible for interpreting the PDA as in the Title VII which it amended, stating what they thought was the correct interpretation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.196" offset="9790488">And as petitioner himself points out, when the Senate report disagreed with the interpretation that was given, it said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.676" offset="9840434">It didn't say that it disagreed with the interpretation that was presented there, which is consistent with the one we're arguing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.751" offset="9876692">And, therefore, we think it's a fair inference that they agreed with that interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.560" offset="9895918">That's... unless there are further questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2619.895" offset="10613241">Our position here as to why it is not sex discrimination within the meaning of Title VII goes a little further, because it's not just the question... position of the Government here that there is a classification of pregnancy which they contend is sex discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.608" offset="10676143">It's that that classification has resulted in less compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.980" offset="10697668">Now, I would say and submit to this Court that the plan that is before this Court results not in less compensation to the male employee, including the male employee with a spouse, because the same risks are covered for under the health insurance package.</text>

            <text syncTime="2667.345" offset="10803099">Now, to me I don't think there's any support under Title VII's sex discrimination law with respect to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.874" offset="10829221">This is not a case of less generous benefits as alleged by Government counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="2710.671" offset="10976343">Well, certainly the language in the Senate report that says it's intended to treat pregnancy, discrimination on account of pregnancy like any other discrimination on account of sex goes against you.</text>

            <text syncTime="2726.711" offset="11040499">--It goes against us if it was looked in isolation, I would submit, Justice O'Connor, to the purposes behind that particular statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.333" offset="11079056">And one has to query whether or not the female spouse is so similarly situated as the female employee for purpose of an insurance plan like this which already provides an additional risk coverage for pregnancy of that spouse to that employee, as to whether or not Congress' general observation would apply equally as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.541" offset="11171843">And, in fact, if Congress had so intended, it would have been easy for Congress to put in the second clause not just women affected by pregnancy, but men and women affected by pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.709" offset="11212490">And that was essentially suggested by the Departments of Justice, the EEOC, and the Department of Labor in that first letter to Senator Javits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.082" offset="11246031">Congress chose not to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.830" offset="11253032">I would submit that it has to be looked at within the entire ambit of what Congress was grappling with, but I still say the Government bears the burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.530" offset="11287827">It is not a per se case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.795" offset="11296917">They have the burden for getting intent of at least showing the fact that the compensation plan here was worth less to the male.</text>
