            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="151551">We will hear arguments first this morning in Missouri against Hunter.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.715" offset="178405">Mr. Koppe, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="philip_m_koppe" startTime="11.871" stopTime="155.372">
            <label>Mr. Philip M. Koppe</label>
            <text syncTime="11.871" offset="198989">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.025" offset="211633">This case represents the culmination of a six-year struggle by the State of Missouri to enforce the multiple punishment provisions of Missouri's armed criminal action statute, a statute which makes it a separate offense punishable by a separate sentence to commit a felony with the use, aid or assistance of a dangerous or deadly weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.564" offset="285716">For the last three years, anyway, it has been an uphill battle.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.184" offset="304211">In a series of decisions beginning in January of 1980, the Missouri Supreme Court has ruled that the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment, applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, insofar as it prohibits multiple punishments for the same offense, prevents the state from convicting a defendant for both armed criminal action and the predicate or underlying felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.271" offset="400550">The court reached its conclusion even though it also concluded that the legislature intended multiple punishments under both statutes and even though those punishments were assessed in a single proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.201" offset="448302">Twice this Court has directed the Missouri Supreme Court to reconsider these rulings, first in light of Whalen versus United States, then again in light of Albernaz versus the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.320" offset="504831">On both occasions, however, the Missouri Supreme Court declined to take advantage of the opportunity to change its ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.164" offset="532207">As the result of the Missouri Supreme Court's adherence to what we regard as an erroneous conclusion, the Missouri Court of Appeals in this case reversed the Respondent's 15-year concurrent sentence for armed criminal action, leaving intact a concurrent 10-year sentence for the predicate felony, which was robbery in the first degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.263" offset="616531">Unaffected by the court's holding and not involved in this case was a consecutive five-year sentence that the Respondent received pursuant to an assault conviction arising out of the same transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.898" offset="659058">The issue presented by this case, then, is strictly a legal one, devoid of any procedural complexities or factual disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.304" offset="696674">And that question is simply whether or not the State, without offending the double jeopardy clause, may impose cumulative punishments for conduct arising from the same act or transaction for both a compound or greater offense, in this case armed criminal action, and also the predicate or lesser included offense, in this case robbery in the first degree.</text>

            <text syncTime="230.170" offset="1072211">Okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.764" offset="1078584">The Court of Appeals did not treat this issue with any degree of specificity.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.498" offset="1097497">It simply cited the two Sours cases and the Haggard cases, the cases that were decided by the Missouri Supreme Court en banc.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.932" offset="1123202">It felt it was bound by those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.431" offset="1133233">So in order to fully understand the reasoning behind the Supreme Court's decisions, you must look to Sours I and II, a case called State versus Haggard, where the court reconsidered this issue following Albernaz, and most recently in a case called State versus Kane, all of which are cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.047" offset="1199688">All four of those opinions are essentially the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.374" offset="1212958">They basically state that since the legislature, whether intentionally or otherwise, has made the predicate offense, in this case robbery but the underlying felony, in a sense a lesser included offense of the compound offense, that that is prohibited by the double jeopardy clause because it is the same offense within the meaning of Blockburger.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.758" offset="1298535">According to the Missouri Supreme Court, when you apply the Blockburger test you come up short, because both statutes do not require proof of an element that the other one does not.</text>

            <text syncTime="313.357" offset="1404906">Well, the Court of Appeals reached that decision because in the two Sours cases and in Haggard that was the procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.900" offset="1431133">There really wasn't any explication of why they did that until after this case was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.615" offset="1449941">In State versus Kane, which actually followed Hunter and is the last word on the subject, the Supreme Court indicated that the reason it would vacate the armed criminal action conviction was because what the state legislature had attempted to do was pass an enhancement statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.515" offset="1517546">However, the court reasoned that the enhancement failed because of the way the statute was phrased, and the court expressly said that in Kane.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.418" offset="1553177">And I think that case illustrates more than anything precisely what this case is about.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.809" offset="1570731">We're not really arguing constitutional principles in any real sense; we're arguing phraseology.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.649" offset="1594137">Basically, the State's position here is that the State of Missouri could have done precisely the same thing, assessed precisely the same punishment in a single statute--</text>

            <text syncTime="464.530" offset="2009589">What the court said, and I know I've cited it in my brief, but basically, when explaining why they were vacating what they had held to be the greater offense, was that the attempted enhancement which they had tried failed because of its phraseology or the way it was phrased.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.021" offset="2091613">They expressly make that statement, and I think that that to me demonstrates an illustration of again what this case really hinges on.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.125" offset="2120034">It hinges on phraseology, because our argument is that the State in this case could have passed a single statute and assessed exactly the same punishment for this particular conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.434" offset="2169249">And the Missouri Supreme Court in effect so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.995" offset="2179489">The Missouri Supreme Court flatly stated in the Kane case that there was nothing unconstitutional with giving the defendant an additional amount of punishment because of his use of a weapon to commit a crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="553.071" offset="2363809">Then there are other states which have simply added punishment to the sentence for the particular felony involved, and the court considered that the latter type of statutes was the true enhancement statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="593.806" offset="2526709">And simply what the Supreme Court was saying was, what the Missouri Supreme Court was saying is, if the state legislature had done it in a slightly different fashion, if it had taken all the punishment and put it in a single sentence... excuse me, a single statute... there wouldn't have been a constitutional violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.548" offset="2597657">And what we're saying is, if they had put all the punishment in a single sentence it certainly would have been a less roundabout way of doing it, but the fact that they chose to do it in separate statutes raises no... or shouldn't raise a constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.838" offset="2650842">Now, it does because they held that the double jeopardy clause prohibited the legislature in this state from doing it in this fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.725" offset="2686369">And in arguing the point in his brief, counsel for the Respondent in this case basically says that the role of the double jeopardy clause in single prosecution cases prevents a state legislature or Congress from assessing punishment over two statutes, that it has to do with the distribution of punishments.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.293" offset="2772678">And that is essentially what the case is really about.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.263" offset="2780514">The Missouri Supreme Court never actually said it in that fashion, but that's really what their decision comes down to.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.260" offset="2804547">And what we're arguing basically is that this is simply a matter of form over substance, that this really doesn't raise any significant constitutional issue, because the sole question here is one of legislative intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.504" offset="2853553">We are not dealing with a successive prosecution case.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.300" offset="2864733">If we were dealing with a situation where the State had attempted not only to assess multiple punishments under two statutes but to impose those statutes in two separate proceedings, then you would have an altogether different issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.323" offset="2920740">Then you would have a Harris versus Oklahoma problem, Illinois versus Vitale, a Brown versus Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.976" offset="2947384">But in this case the question is what is the role of the double jeopardy clause insofar as it prohibits multiple punishments for the same offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.911" offset="2979149">And of course we felt that the issue was resolved, had been resolved once and for all in Albernaz versus United States, where this Court in its last two sentences of the opinion says:</text>
            <text syncTime="717.861" offset="3022931">"The question of what punishment are constitutionally permissible. "</text>
            <text syncTime="721.031" offset="3035574">--talking about the prohibition against multiple punishments for the same offense...</text>
            <text syncTime="725.781" offset="3054591">"The question of what punishments are constitutionally permissible is not different from the question of what punishment the legislative branch intended to be imposed. "</text>
            <text syncTime="734.321" offset="3088759">"Where Congress intended, as it did here, to impose multiple punishment, imposition of such sentences does not violate the Constitution. "</text>
            <text syncTime="740.758" offset="3114568">Now, the Missouri Supreme Court on remand in State versus Haggard seemed to indicate that these sentences, if they meant what they said and if binding on the court, would prevent the vacation of the armed criminal action statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.643" offset="3166082">But essentially what they said was, this is dicta, we don't have to follow this opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.640" offset="3190010">Now, of course, the Delaware Supreme Court on remand in a similar case also felt it was dicta, but also thought that it was an evolving rule that it was therefore obligated or should follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.652" offset="3234104">Our argument of course is that it is not dicta and, notwithstanding the concurrence in the case which said that this statement was not supported by either precedent or logic, we think it's supported by both.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.692" offset="3294291">To be sure, I think the opinions of this Court indicate that in the double jeopardy area... in some of its opinions I think it's been described as not exactly being a model of clarity.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.437" offset="3333265">Justice Rehnquist referred to it as the Sargasso Sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.826" offset="3346849">And it is true that the various opinions have different emphasis.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.406" offset="3361164">There are dicta running throughout the opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.530" offset="3373598">Just when you think you've figured out what the opinion holds, there is a footnote that makes you wonder.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.041" offset="3391675">But nevertheless, this Court in Whalen and again in Albernaz for really the first time took some time to attempt to explicate the rationale that underlies the double jeopardy clause in single prosecution cases, and basically indicated that its role, its sole role there, was to enforce the legislative intent because it recognized that the legislative function to define crimes and prescribe offenses is not circumscribed by the Fifth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1038.763" offset="4306588">There are three categories under the Recidivism Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.387" offset="4317037">The first is a prior offender, which requires only one prior.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.339" offset="4328844">The third category is dangerous, which requires only one prior dangerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.350" offset="4348906">The middle category is persistent, which does require two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.067" offset="4363744">However, the statute expressly states that you may not use more than one arising out of the same transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.189" offset="4388299">But that really gets to the argument that I was making.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.503" offset="4401464">If there is some constitutional problem with the state labeling... and I'm saying this is what we're talking about, is labels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.124" offset="4428005">If there is some constitutional inhibition based on the state's labeling of conduct which the state might otherwise have characterized as one offense, labeling that as two, it would be because of possible collateral consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.164" offset="4480145">But what I argue in my brief under subsection D is this: that we could make this a single crime, punishable by a single extended sentence, and still bring into account those collateral consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.878" offset="4538973">For example, take the recidivism statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.910" offset="4547123">At the present time Missouri does not allow you to use two for purposes of the Persistent or Dangerous Offender Act if they arise from the same transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.422" offset="4577216">Suppose, however, that the state were to tomorrow amend the statute and make no distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.543" offset="4597696">Then you might say that the defendant, by receiving two convictions for this particular course of conduct, is in a worse position, and he would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.854" offset="4626953">But what I'm saying is, under the Blockburger rule what the State of Missouri could do is go back and rewrite the statute and make it a single offense punishable by a single extended statute... excuse me... extended sentence, but then say: Nothing to the contrary withstanding in the statute on the Persistent and Dangerous Offender Act, a conviction which is enhanced because of the defendant's use of a weapon may serve to implement the provisions of the Persistent and Dangerous Offender Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.140" offset="4744087">Another possible collateral consequence would come into effect, for example, if the defendant was reconvicted and took the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.761" offset="4778568">The argument would be, well, now you have two convictions instead of one that he could be impeached with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.944" offset="4799257">Present Missouri law would allow only impeachment on the basis of actual convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.005" offset="4823499">However, once again the state could simply make it a single sentence and include as part of the punishment the fact that, nothing withstanding in any other statutes be... a sentence which has been enhanced because of the defendant's use of the weapon, that enhancement may be used to impeach his credibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.825" offset="4902807">So essentially what I'm saying is, you can accomplish... anything that you can accomplish in two statutes, you can accomplish in one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.462" offset="4929347">And so if there's going to be any inquiry with respect to the punishment imposed here, it would be whether or not the total punishment, the total punishment, whether you're talking about direct punishment or collateral consequences, whether that punishment would be excessive or whether that punishment would be cruel and unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.473" offset="5005415">But this... you know, that involves some other provision of the Constitution, the Eight Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.125" offset="5024015">That is not the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.048" offset="5031642">Our argument is basically that when you're talking about the Fifth Amendment in single prosecution cases that the role of the double jeopardy clause acts as a restraint on courts and prosecutors and protects a defendant against receiving more punishment than what the legislative branch intended he receive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.367" offset="5104994">Now, when we made this argument in the Supreme Court basically what they said, among other things, was that, well, you have created a rule which has immunized the legislative branch from the double jeopardy clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.738" offset="5150447">And we think really that that begs the question, because if the protection, as we argue, is designed to ensure that a defendant does not receive more punishment than what the legislature imposed, it really doesn't make any sense to say, well, you've immunized the legislature from the scope of the clause, because basically what we've said is that the clause is designed to protect a defendant from courts and prosecutorial overreaching.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.913" offset="5259117">And in this case, unlike many of the others that this Court has had to decide in this area, there is no question about the legislative intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.020" offset="5291613">Not only does the statute, like its federal counterpart... not only does the statute indicate that the punishment shall be in addition to the punishment for the underlying felony, but the Missouri--</text>

            <text syncTime="1659.128" offset="6788011">However, as applied in any given situation, obviously whatever felony you prove up is not going to require any additional elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.846" offset="6818836">But in the abstract, as in Whalen, for example, which involved felony murder and I think a rape, the underlying felony did not have to be rape.</text>

            <text syncTime="1698.329" offset="6944851">In single prosecution cases, anyway, it's simply a rule to define legislative intent.</text>

            <text syncTime="3111.614" offset="12597958">On the other hand, it claims that in the successive prosecution context it's a rule of constitutional magnitude which prohibits the imposition of punishment under two statutes even if that is what the legislature intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.606" offset="12649889">It makes this claim because it believes that in the successive prosecution context the clause embodies a policy other than that of avoiding multiple punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.759" offset="12694506">Of course, in a reprosecution after an acquittal the clause embodies a policy of not permitting the state an opportunity to convict those who have already been found to be not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.583" offset="12749781">But in a reprosecution after a conviction the clause embodies no policy other than that of avoiding multiple punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.203" offset="12788338">In Brown against Ohio this Court stated that it was avoiding multiple punishment which came about as the result of a reprosecution after conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.400" offset="12829089">It specifically disavowed it was avoiding the repetition of proof or having the defendant undergo two trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.884" offset="12867019">Missouri's request for you to declare the Blockburger test to be solely a rule of statutory construction lays the foundation of the eventual abolition of the protection against reprosecution after conviction, in addition to the abolition of the protection against multiple punishment for the same offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.481" offset="12961373">In addition to Albernaz and Whalen, Missouri has cited other decisions of this Court which it claims to be controlling authority which should have required the Missouri courts to affirm the armed criminal action convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.536" offset="13049667">One of those is Brintley against Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.065" offset="13063773">In Brintley against Michigan this Court dismissed an appeal for want of a substantial federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.955" offset="13091358">That case is not controlling authority for the same reason that Albernaz is not controlling authority: The two statutes in Michigan were construed to be, by the Michigan court, to be separate offenses, not the same offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.431" offset="13157187">Therefore, in dismissing the appeal in Brintley against Michigan this Court was merely applying an established principle to a particular fact situation, the principle being the punishment may be imposed for two statutes that are separate offenses, the particular situation being the two Michigan statutes being construed to be separate offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.826" offset="13254780">In conclusion, to declare the Blockburger test to be solely a rule of statutory construction is to abandon to the legislature this Court's constitutional duty to determine the meaning of the constitutional phrase "the same offense".</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.818" offset="13346731">If it is solely a rule of statutory construction, then it is the legislature that determines the meaning of the constitutional phrase "the same offense".</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.095" offset="13391871">By merely declaring its intent to punish under two statutes that otherwise would be the same offense, the legislature can make those statutes to be not the same offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.652" offset="13442131">By declaring the multiple punishment provision of the armed criminal action statute to be in violation of the double jeopardy clause, this Court can bring the legislative power to the judgment of the superior power of the Constitution and yet still recognize the power of the legislature to define crimes and fix punishment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3374.647" offset="13650065">Basically, what the Respondent says is that the double jeopardy clause as applied to single prosecution cases prevents the legislature from distributing punishment it might otherwise have assessed over two statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3389.891" offset="13711087">Look at this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.501" offset="13717461">If the state legislature had done the statute the way the Missouri Supreme Court says they should have, what they would have done was allowed the assessment of an additional term of years onto the original robbery sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.180" offset="13772214">If they had accomplished that, what the Defendant would have received was a ten-year sentence for robbery, enhanced by 15 years, making a total of 25 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.864" offset="13814950">But since the statutes assess the punishment separately, the judge was given the discretion to run those sentences concurrently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.391" offset="13845043">The Defendant received the benefit of those concurrent sentences and wound up with 15 years.</text>
