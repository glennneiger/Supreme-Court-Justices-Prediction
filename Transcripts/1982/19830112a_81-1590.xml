            <label>Mr. David A. Strauss</label>
            <text syncTime="16.882" offset="216244">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.799" offset="251875">Section 3001(e)(2) of Title 39 of the United States Code prohibits the mailing of unsolicited advertisements for contraceptive products.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.763" offset="307777">Section 3001(e)(2) does not prohibit any mailing that the recipient has indicated a desire to receive.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.027" offset="340796">The issue in this case is whether that statute violates the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.961" offset="364515">This action was brought by the appellee, which has been a manufacturer of contraceptive products for some 60 years, and is by its own account the leader in the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.764" offset="423761">Until 1979, appellee promoted its products by means of a sales force and advertisements in magazines.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.996" offset="464721">In 1979, after what appellee describes as business discussions, appellee inaugurated a new marketing strategy that included in addition to its other traditional means of advertising a campaign of mass unsolicited mailings to members of the general public at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.347" offset="566076">The Postal Service advised appellee that these mailings would violate Section 3001(e)(2), and appellee then brought this suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, alleging that Section 3001(e)(2) violated the Constitution, and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.412" offset="658341">The District Court found that appellee's mailings are commercial solicitations and promotional materials in which appellee has a commercial interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.581" offset="711004">It accordingly declared that they are commercial speech, entitled to lesser protection under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.872" offset="752173">The District Court also concluded that Section 3001(e)(2) directly furthers specific and important government interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.053" offset="800865">But the District Court nonetheless declared Section 3001(e)(2) unconstitutional because it believed that it could devise an alternative that, while not protecting the government's interests quite as well, struck what the District Court viewed as a better balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.284" offset="873799">That alternative was highly elaborate.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.063" offset="888950">Its central feature was a series of warnings in large letters on the outside of appellee's unsolicited mailings.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.184" offset="925417">The District Court ordered its alternative into effect and enjoined the enforcement of Section 3001(e)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="204.524" offset="966795">We then brought this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.539" offset="978811">Unlike restrictions on commercial expression that this Court has invalidated in the past, Section 3001(e)(2) is a narrow and specific limitation, and its effect on First Amendment rights can only be described as minimal.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.733" offset="1063657">It has no application to any form of non-commercial speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.699" offset="1087480">For that reason, organizations that advocate birth control or family planning as a social or moral matter are free to do so by using the mails, even by using the mails on an unsolicited basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.941" offset="1152473">Section 3001(e)(2) also has no application to a wide range of advertising, including all the methods of advertising that appellee itself has used so successfully for so long.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.562" offset="1214958">It does not have any application to advertising that does not use the mail, and it does not have any application to much advertising that does.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.481" offset="1250589">For example, it does not apply to advertisements in magazines or other publications that are sent through the mail so long as the recipient has indicated a desire to receive the publication.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.066" offset="1296982">And it has no application even to unsolicited advertising that is mailed to persons with a professional interest in contraception such as physicians and pharmacists and dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.390" offset="1350272">These people, of course, particularly physicians and pharmacists, can counsel and advise others on the use of contraception.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.889" offset="1380261">But most important, Section 3001(e)(2) does not prevent any person from receiving any of appellee's mailings if appellee only obtains his consent, and appellee can even use the mail in an effort to obtain his consent, because Section 3001(e)(2) as interpreted by the Postal Service does not prohibit a premailing in which an advertiser asks a postal customer to consent to receiving a line of contraceptive advertisements.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="342.030" offset="1516829">Of course, in the real world, I suppose that when you are asking for what is basically consent to receive junk mail, most people would say, no, I don't want to receive it, whereas if they could send it directly, there is some chance, I suppose, that the advertisement might sell them on getting the stuff.</text>

            <text syncTime="360.272" offset="1589763">Well, that may be right, and I assume that is why Youngs Drug is so interested in sending unsolicited mailings, but there is no First Amendment interest in forcing publications or information on people who don't want to receive it.</text>

            <text syncTime="387.526" offset="1698746">I think Congress may well have that power.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.729" offset="1707627">Of course, such a measure would present issues not presented here, because it would be far broader, and it would answer to far less specific government interests, but I think Congress may--</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="399.412" offset="1746288">Now, in this instance there are other types of so-called potentially offensive material that could be mailed under this statute and aren't prohibited, right?</text>

            <label>Mr. David A. Strauss</label>
            <text syncTime="410.750" offset="1791742">--There are other... other materials that don't pertain to contraception that could be mailed under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.421" offset="1814416">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.953" offset="1820476">These premailings efforts by an advertiser to obtain consent to mail its products could be a separate mailing, or they could be a part of another mailing advertising other products so that the advertiser wouldn't have to spend the extra postage, or of course they needn't be mailed at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.634" offset="1883275">They could be distributed with a product or distributed at a drug store.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.178" offset="1897381">The only effect therefore of the statute that the District Court struck down is to require advertisers like the appellee to use some means, any means to see whether the persons to whom they are sending their ads are willing to receive them.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.092" offset="1985048">At the same time, as even the District Court acknowledged, Section 3001(e)(2) directly advances important government interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.741" offset="2039696">First, parents can legitimately wish that if they so desire, they, and not appellee, or some other advertiser trying to sell its wares, will be the first to introduce their children to contraception and related subjects.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.158" offset="2113361">But if unsolicited advertisements for contraception... for contraceptive products are allowed in the mails, it is simply inevitable that some of them will fall into the hands of children, against the wishes of their parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.747" offset="2171666">The second, in the area of commercial speech, and particularly commercial speech that enters the home, Congress has the power to regulate expression on the ground that it may be offensive to its audience.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.237" offset="2245645">It would be a significant expansion and an unwarranted expansion of the protection the Court has accorded to commercial speech to say that it cannot be regulated on the basis of its offensiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.685" offset="2303428">Contraception is a subject of particular intimacy and privacy and delicacy, so much so that it has a special constitutional status, and there is no doubt that many people will find commercial solicitations about such a subject to be offensive.</text>

            <text syncTime="640.440" offset="2710416">Well, it wouldn't accomplish the legislature's purposes for a number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.565" offset="2726925">In the first place, of course, someone would have to receive at least one mailing from that company before he knew that he didn't want any further mailings from that company, so he would be open to at least one mailing from every advertiser for these products.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.697" offset="2783454">And second, that... such a measure might very well have the effect of being a greater burden on the values that the First Amendment is designed to protect than the statute at issue here, because presumably the advertiser, which in the case of a drug company is likely to have many other items of importance to advertise, would cut off all mailings to that customer.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.942" offset="2868509">In fact, in the statute you suggest, Mr. Chief Justice, that seems to be precisely what it would require.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.844" offset="2892019">And since the point of the constitutional protection for commercial expression is to ensure that information reaches potential consumers, such a statute would defeat the purpose of that protection to a large degree.</text>

            <text syncTime="716.691" offset="3015422">The first is Congress's explicit statement in the legislative history that contraception is a matter of personal choice, which statement accompanied the repeal of sweeping prohibitions on the circulation of information about contraception and the replacement of those sweeping prohibitions with this much more narrow and specific limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.120" offset="3105178">And the second, again, the best possible evidence of Congress's intent, which is the statute itself, permits unsolicited mailings to persons like physicians and pharmacists who are in a position to give out advice to those who seek it.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.204" offset="3173515">The statute is tailored entirely to prevent commercial solicitations from reaching those who do not want to receive them, while permitting the broadest possible circulation of information about contraception to those who do want to receive it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1735.914" offset="7092300">The fact of the matter is, as the government concedes in its brief, there is no legislative history supporting the asserted purposes the government has put forth, namely, sensitivity in the protection of minors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.672" offset="7143395">Indeed, the government says that the statute was carefully drawn to excluded the non-commercial advertiser, Planned parenthood, but for three years the government interpreted the statute to excluded all unsolicited communication concerning contraception, because it was the vestige in the antagonism of the Comstock Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2400.761" offset="9751774">But this Court held in Bigelow that information of this type in this area, in the area of contraception and family planning, has a special constitutional status, and before the government may intrude upon that area, they must show a compelling governmental interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.349" offset="9830037">And indeed, even if there were not this specially protected constitutional value, because this statute is content related, it is not content neutral, and because it discriminates against speakers, that is, Planned Parenthood can speak where we cannot speak, then this governmental restriction is still subject to the most compelling interest test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.900" offset="9936303">However, if you retreat from that test and just say that they have to show a substantial interest, nevertheless, the law is clear that even in the commercial speech area the government must restrict the speech in the least restrictive manner, and this is not the least restrictive manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.424" offset="10018432">Congress struck that balance in Section 3008.</text>

            <text syncTime="2479.168" offset="10065348">That is the least restrictive manner, because it gives Youngs the right to mail and Mr. Strauss the right if he does not want to receive the mail to cut off the mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.037" offset="10108816">And this statute, whether you measure it on a compelling interest test, a substantial interest test, will not pass constitutional muster on any basis, because it is not the least restrictive means.</text>

            <text syncTime="2937.855" offset="11900084">Otherwise, they would be violating the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.667" offset="11911369">And Mr. Comstock, of course, was a mortal enemy of the birth control movement, and particularly Margaret Sanger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.180" offset="11941462">But moving from 1873 to 1970, when they changed the Act, it was originally proposed that all vestiges against prohibiting unsolicited mail concerning contraceptives be eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.562" offset="12014919">The Post Office took that view, the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, and the Department of Labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.654" offset="12039265">Somewhere along the line, the Post Office changed its mind and recommended to Congress that they retain the restriction on unsolicited... Justice Strong, I am told, is the author.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.256" offset="12101750">Justice Strong.</text>

            <text syncTime="3013.950" offset="12204463">In any event, the Post Office changed its mind, and said, retain this restriction on unsolicited contraceptive advertisement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.194" offset="12245423">Congress adopted that without any discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.663" offset="12263395">The Post Office gave no reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.519" offset="12270814">Congress gave no reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.661" offset="12275307">But at the same time, and under the same title, it did discuss and it did adopt Section 3008, which balanced the right of the sender and the right of the recipient, and struck the balance on the side of the mailer to mail and on the side of the recipient to cut off.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.246" offset="12357645">Now, if Rowan itself were not dispositive of this case, then we should look at the decision of this Court in Carey versus Population Services International, because there, the state of New York in banning contraceptive advertisement put forth the very same reason that the government puts forth here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.782" offset="12463807">One, sensitivity, and two, the protection of minors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.012" offset="12492751">And this Court held, and I think most of the Court joined in this expression, but these are not classically justifications validating the suppression of expression protected by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.930" offset="12548444">The government's asserted interests in this case were expressly rejected by this Court in Carey, and going on, foreshadowing this case, this Court stated at Page 678,</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.141" offset="12617302">"Appellant suggests no distinction between commercial and non-commercial speech that would render these discredited arguments meritorious when offered to justify prohibitions on commercial speech. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.401" offset="12678324">"On the contrary, such arguments are clearly directed not at any commercial aspect of the prohibited advertising but at the ideas conveyed and form of expression, the core of First Amendment values. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.255" offset="12737675">And that is what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.037" offset="12744884">We have hostility to the ideas conveyed and the form of expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.877" offset="12768186">And Justice Powell, I believe, stated it very well in his concurring opinion in Carey when he talked about the privacy of the home as being the best place for one to consider and study this important subject, that the marketplace, no matter how impersonal, was not anonymous and that the home was the proper place for this subject, and indeed, Justice Powell pointed out in a footnote that although at the home one bore the risk of this material and information falling into the hands of minors, that did not justify cutting it off from the home, because that would burden the rights, constitutional rights of adults.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.185" offset="12949475">If Rowan doesn't solve the problem, and if Carey does not lay this problem to rest, then certainly this Court's decision in Consolidated Edison is on all fours with this case, because there, you had a person commercially interested talking about nuclear power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.363" offset="13038187">Here we have Youngs, who is in the business of birth control and prevention of venereal disease.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.644" offset="13067235">That is the heart and essence of our business in a protected area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.672" offset="13083431">But in Consolidated Edison, that regulation was struck.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.061" offset="13100986">This Court applied the compelling interest test, because the regulation was content based, and it was speaker discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.291" offset="13137871">This Court held that the corporate speaker may not be discriminated against, and we submit that Youngs may not be discriminated against.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.444" offset="13174442">New York, like the government here, said, oh, this is content neutral, because we are banning all speech on this subject, just like the government says here, this is content neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.875" offset="13228150">We don't have any hostility towards contraception.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.748" offset="13239644">You just can't talk about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.169" offset="13249361">But in Consolidated Edison, this Court pointed out that the First Amendment, if it means anything, means the government cannot prohibit speech of an entire topic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.604" offset="13291157">In Consolidated Edison, the state of New York, like the government here, alleged captive audience, intrusiveness upon the home, and this Court held, well, you could take the advertisement, put it from your hand, and put it in the wastepaper basket.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.144" offset="13353224">Indeed, this Court averted to a Rowan type solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.128" offset="13373182">And this Court in Consolidated Edison pointed out that because a speaker has alternative means of communication that does not justify a content based ban on discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.353" offset="13438070">The government talks about a premailer, that Youngs should make a premailer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.836" offset="13460013">Well, part of the power to communicate is the power to communicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.071" offset="13476940">If I wrote you and said, I mean, how many of those just advertisements do you throw away?</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.004" offset="13496688">Do you want to learn more about a Cadillac?</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.301" offset="13505884">Do you want to know about an RCA television?</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.801" offset="13515915">Well, you are not going to pay attention unless you are a particular buyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.922" offset="13532424">But the government's solution of the premailer was expressly rejected by this Court's decision in Lamont versus Postmaster General.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.809" offset="13575892">Now, I have to add that I don't understand how Youngs would not violate the statute and be subject to five years in the penitentiary by writing and saying, do you wish to receive contraceptive advertisements?</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.867" offset="13632212">Because I think that is an advertisement unto itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.193" offset="13645482">But assuming that I could send a premailer, this Court held in Lamont versus Postmaster General that by requiring the addressee to do an affirmative act, you are chilling the addressee's First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.094" offset="13705041">Number Two, under Linmark, you are burdening Youngs's First Amendment right, and certainly in Lamont they pointed out that there was a less restrictive means available, namely, as under 3008, the addressee could say he or she did not want to receive the mail, and do not send it to any person in the household under the age of 19.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.272" offset="13797828">In summary, we have a content based ban on speech, a ban on speech which is speaker discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.018" offset="13836803">It makes no sense to say that Planned Parenthood could send these materials into the home on an unsolicited basis, but Youngs is barred from the adult population of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.138" offset="13885286">I do think that in the year 1983, with the problems that beset our community, our country, and the world, that that type of restriction comes very late in the day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.586" offset="13938994">But certainly Section 3008 solves the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.724" offset="13963549">If the person doesn't want to use the wastebasket method of treatment, and I agree with Justice Marshall, we should not presume that children are going to read the mail of the parents... we are not trying... Youngs is not and did not ask for the right to send these materials to minors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.467" offset="14034602">We want to address and educate the adult population of this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.761" offset="14051738">If the wastepaper basket isn't enough, certainly the least tailored restriction is found under the same title passed by Congress to address the needs that the government has suggested here, namely, the right under 3008, approved by this Court in Rowan, to say, send no more mail of this type to my household.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.580" offset="14135017">We ask that the decision of Judge Penn in all respects be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3507.546" offset="14178902">Three points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.560" offset="14182977">First, this statute was passed in the 1970's, not the 1870's.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.544" offset="14198860">When it was passed, Congress swept away all restrictions on mailings, non-commercial mailings, all restrictions on solicited commercial mailings, and many important restrictions on unsolicited commercial mailings, and Congress did so while it was avowing that contraception is a matter of individual personal choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.098" offset="14273048">I would also point out that in 1970, when Congress considered and passed the statute, it was five years before Bigelow and six years before Virginia Pharmacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.656" offset="14311291">At that time it was black letter law that all commercial speech could be regulated without regard to the First Amendment, and had Congress wanted to come as close as it could to--</text>

            <label>Mr. David A. Strauss</label>
            <text syncTime="3559.304" offset="14385897">Well, by all the lower courts, and presumably by Congress had it wanted to see it close to the line, Justice Blackmun.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.834" offset="14408048">We all recognize the validity of subsequent criticisms, but even in Pittsburgh Plate Glass in 1973, the Court still treated Valentine against Christianson as the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.862" offset="14444097">Had Congress wanted to suppress as much information about contraception as it possibly could have or had it wanted to act out of antipathy to contraception, it would have... it would not have eliminated so many restrictions on commercial expression as it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.464" offset="14502507">Second, Lamont, which was just introduced now by appellee, involved... required... the statute in that case required a willing recipient to acknowledge to the government that he wanted to receive political mailings that the government had declared to be subversive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.644" offset="14567291">That is obviously worlds removed from a premailing to a private advertiser in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.671" offset="14595399">Third, appellee insists that he doesn't want to send these to unwilling recipients, or so it seems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.498" offset="14622671">And that this problem could be constitutionally solved by allowing unwilling recipients to cut off the mailings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.136" offset="14657257">If that is right, then the only question in this case is, who is going to bear the burden?</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.790" offset="14679826">Does an unwilling recipient have to buy a locked mailbox or make an extra trip to the post office, certify that these materials are sexually arousing and erotically provocative, closely monitor his mail, or do something else, or does an advertiser who is already engaged in continual mass mailings and is in the business of reaching the public and finding out what the public thinks, does the advertiser just have to take some measure, at most one additional mailing, to see if the persons to whom he is sending his advertisements are willing to receive them?</text>
