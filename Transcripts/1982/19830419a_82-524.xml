            <label>Mr. David A. Strauss</label>
            <text syncTime="82.405" offset="460245">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.325" offset="483964">The issue in this case is whether the Nuclear Regulatory Commission adequately considered the impact that disposing of the spent fuel from nuclear power plants will have on the environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.817" offset="545926">In 1972, the Commission began an informal rulemaking proceeding to consider this and other associated environmental impacts and the effect they should have on applications for licenses to build or operate nuclear reactors.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.309" offset="627846">Seven years later the Commission adopted the final version of the rule that is at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.072" offset="658880">In the interim the Commission had conducted two extensive staff studies, three informal rulemaking proceedings in which literally thousands of pages of comments were exchanged, and a total of over two weeks of hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.830" offset="729933">The rule itself went through four versions that differed in detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.266" offset="751667">The rule specifies in a table the amount of radioactivity that will be released to the environment in the course of disposing of various kinds of nuclear wastes, and it provides that this table is to be included in the environmental impact statements that are prepared in connection with each individual reactor license.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.694" offset="849365">The licensing boards that consider individual applications are then not to receive additional evidence on the amount of radiation released.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.876" offset="898162">The reason for precluding the boards from reconsidering the radiation releases in individual cases is that these releases are entirely generic, that is to say they are always the same for a reactor of a given size no matter where or when the reactor is built.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.916" offset="966289">Many aspects of this rule are not at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.882" offset="990113">For example, the Commission made the very pessimistic assumption that all of the radioactive gases would escape from the wastes, and it listed in the table the resulting amounts of radioactivity that would be released.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.266" offset="1051657">The aspect of the rule that is at issue here concerns high-level solid wastes, many of which remain radioactive for thousands of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.419" offset="1096274">The Commission's conclusion reflected in the rule is that these wastes can be buried in a certain geologic formation of a kind that is found in 24 of the 50 states in such a way that they will not release a significant amount of radiation to the environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.129" offset="1179135">The Commission studied a number of events, natural or man-made that might cause radiation to escape from such a repository.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.999" offset="1218632">For example, the Commission concluded that a direct hit by a meteorite a mile and a quarter in diameter would release radiation sufficient to contaminate the area within roughly an 11-mile radius of the repository.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.322" offset="1283938">But such a meteorite--</text>

            <text syncTime="307.033" offset="1358753">[Laughter]</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_a_strauss" startTime="309.968" stopTime="636.933">
            <label>Mr. David A. Strauss</label>
            <text syncTime="309.968" offset="1370455">An earthquake fault, the Commission estimated, would occur at a typical site every 25 billion years.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.481" offset="1412565">A more likely although still unlikely occurrence is that ground water would penetrate the repository, but ground water usually moves very slowly and the Commission calculated that by the time the radioactive materials in the groundwater reached the surface they would be so diluted and they would have decayed to such a degree that a person receiving the maximum exposure to that ground water would be subject to radiation roughly equal to the background radiation of the atmosphere and the soil.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.468" offset="1552477">The Commission accordingly concluded that so far as science could determine the chances of a substantial release of radiation from the repository are minimal to the point of being banishing, and the more likely occurrences would not release significant amounts of radiation.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.881" offset="1638158">Now, the Court of Appeals did not question that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.677" offset="1657384">At the same time the Commission acknowledged explicitly and, in fact, repeatedly that there is, of course, a certain irreducible and imponderable uncertainty involved in predicting what will happen so far into the future and in making predictions about a repository site that has not yet been specifically designated.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.495" offset="1756650">But the Commission concluded that although these uncertainties exist, a reasonable working assumption that the licensing boards are to use is that there will be no releases of radiation from the solid wastes once the repository has been sealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.472" offset="1832509">The Court of Appeals had invalidated an earlier version of the rule on the ground that the Commission did not follow sufficiently elaborate procedures in assessing the impacts of nuclear wastes.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.496" offset="1896666">This Court reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.652" offset="1905234">On remand, the Court of Appeals, now working with a rulemaking record that had been greatly supplemented by the Commission, invalidated all versions of the rule on the ground that the Commission violated the National Environmental Policy Act when it determined not to allow licensing boards to reconsider in individual proceedings the uncertainties associated with the disposal of high-level wastes.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.780" offset="2017770">We then sought certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.826" offset="2025920">Although the Court of Appeals based its decision squarely on NEPA, the National Environmental Policy Act, it never identified the language in NEPA or in any decision of this Court that prohibits the Commission from doing what it did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.443" offset="2116408">As this Court has said several times, what NEPA requires is that an agency consider the environmental consequences of its actions and ordinarily disclose them to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.296" offset="2171788">The Commission did consider the uncertainties associated with high-level waste disposal, and it made those uncertainties fully explicit.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.371" offset="2208150">In fact, the Court of Appeals did not suggest otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.370" offset="2224137">On the contrary, both the Court of Appeals and Respondents quote at some length from the Commission's own statements in attempting to show what we freely concede, that there are inevitably uncertainties associated with an inquiry of this sort, nor was the Commission's consideration of these issues not meaningful or only abstract as the Court of Appeals suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.373" offset="2332075">For several years the Commission has been on record as saying that it would not continue to license reactors at all if it did not have reasonable assurance that wastes could be disposed of safely.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.414" offset="2392261">If the ultimate outcome of the Commission's investigation of the waste disposal problem had been that the risks associated with any category of wastes are unacceptably great or if that is ever the outcome because the Commission's investigation of this matter is continuing, the Commission would halt all reactor licensing.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.077" offset="2482958">If the Commission were to conclude that the risks associated with waste disposal, while not that severe, are still grave it would be open to it to decide, for example, to permit reactors to be built or operated only where the need for power is particularly exigent.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.632" offset="2557146">But the Commission concluded instead that the ascertainable risks are minimal, and as I said the Court of Appeals did not question that conclusion on this rulemaking record and that the unavoidable uncertainties should not affect the rate at which reactors are licensed.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.499" offset="2632588">Since that conclusion was reached after thorough, explicit and candid consideration, it simply cannot violate NEPA.</text>

            <text syncTime="636.933" offset="2678354">Mr. Strauss, my feeling about reading the briefs was that it was very much like two ships passing in the night, that apparently each party wanted to follow its own line of analysis and there wasn't too much interaction between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.411" offset="2740317">What exactly do you think the Court of Appeals did wrong in saying that NEPA could make this... that NRC couldn't make this a generic rule?</text>

            <text syncTime="662.562" offset="2780859">I think the Court of Appeals relied on NEPA for a requirement that is simply not found in NEPA.</text>

            <text syncTime="669.637" offset="2809175">Do you understand the Court of Appeals to have had any broader rationale, perhaps I should say more precise rationale, than just the generalized provisions of NEPA?</text>

            <label>Mr. David A. Strauss</label>
            <text syncTime="680.712" offset="2853479">I don't, Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.210" offset="2867481">The Court of Appeals relied on NEPA to a great extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.100" offset="2883050">It also nominally said that the Commission's action violated the arbitrary and capricious standard, but every time it said that it right away said and we find the standards to inform the arbitrary and capricious rule in NEPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.577" offset="2936966">I think what is going on in the Court of Appeals' opinion and in Respondent's brief as well is, because they do not object to the thoroughness or the candor of the Commission's discussions which is the stuff of NEPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.588" offset="2996944">What they seem to be doing is operating with an assumption that NEPA requires that environmental impacts not only be considered by the Commission itself but be considered and reconsidered and perhaps relitigated at every subsequent stage of the agency's decision-making process where it might possibly affect a subordinate official's decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1033.539" offset="4264823">I think actually, Justice Stevens, you brought out another point about what the Commission has done here as opposed to what Respondents and apparently the Court of Appeals would have them do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.565" offset="4308917">The Commission has made a very clear and visible and public focused decision on a matter of no small importance, the question whether reactor licensing is to continue at the same pace despite these imponderable and irreducible uncertainties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.138" offset="4379135">The Commission made its decision, made it visibly, and that is exactly the sort of thing that NEPA is supposed to encourage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.743" offset="4405571">The Respondent's solution would have the effect of scattering the decision on this question among a multitude of very low visibility decisions made by licensing boards in particular cases, decisions that because these uncertainties are really inherently unquantifiable would necessarily be kind of inscrutable, and it cannot be the case that NEPA requires a less visible decision that members of the public would have a more difficult time appreciating than what the Commission did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.760" offset="4553633">I should say that we are not suggesting that there are no limits at all on an agency's ability to organize its internal affairs and to allocate decision-making responsibility between the agency itself and its subordinate bodies, but the question is one of the overall reasonableness of what the agency has done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.422" offset="4652271">It is not a specific inflexible mandate from NEPA, and I think in order to best understand the reasonableness of what the Commission did here, reasonableness deriving from the arbitrary and capricious test, the best way to understand it is to think about what the alternatives might have been in as concrete terms as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.053" offset="4746834">Respondents and the Court of Appeals are somewhat vague on this and understandably so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.051" offset="4774837">For example, it appears that they would want the licensing board to reconsider these uncertainties in a somewhat plenary fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.562" offset="4816842">They would want to be able to try to explain to the licensing boards that these uncertainties should persuade them not to license a particular reactor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.542" offset="4852787">Well, it is easy to see how that could quickly turn each licensing proceeding into a rerun of this monumental rulemaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.585" offset="4893015">These issues are very complex, very technologically difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.365" offset="4912137">The scientific learning on them is found in many sources, and many arguments and considerations could be brought to bear if this question, to what extent should these uncertainties affect the decision to license a reactor, if that question were tossed open in individual licensing proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.059" offset="4994893">If that question were not tossed open, if as Respondents sometime seem to suggest the licensing boards are just supposed to be given a little package that will explain to them exactly what these uncertainties are and this package is somehow to be inserted in the ledger that licensing boards are thought to draw up, if that and no further inquiry at the licensing board stage is to be permitted, if that is what Respondents have in mind, then you have to wonder just what will be accomplished by that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.813" offset="5125923">The package is unlikely to give them any better sense of the uncertainties than what I have said to the Court, as I said, Justice Stevens, or than what the Commission has said, and the result would be that a licensing board would engage in the process of balancing these unquantifiable, imponderable uncertainties against such things as the need for nuclear power.</text>

            <text syncTime="2368.157" offset="9603311">Mr. Atkeson, when airlines are licensed by the CAB or when they are built by airlines, no one would think that they should guarantee that no airplane would never fall and no accident would ever happen and no injury would ever follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.788" offset="9697770">No one think that that should be done, would they seriously?</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.225" offset="9715533">And yet sometimes 200 or 300 people are killed at one time in an airplane accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.533" offset="9740715">Is that not something of what we are dealing with in the broad picture here?</text>

            <text syncTime="2410.172" offset="9771331">I know that the question of how much risk is acceptable is constantly under consideration in our society, and I know that one of the purposes of this rulemaking was to quantify the risk as precisely as possible, and I think that the Commission has done a tremendous job in this respect in the seven years of the rulemaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.736" offset="9901525">But what is left at the end is that the Commission acknowledges as a continuing area of uncertainty and risk, and it seems to us that it is incumbent on the Commission to set that out candidly in the S-3 table and if it is set out there at an appropriate time in the future in the case of a perhaps marginal plant that a decision is made not to go forward with that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2503.758" offset="10145613">The question has been asked what level of risk is acceptable, what is an appropriate response to the requirement of NEPA that risks and uncertainties be set out in the environmental impact statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.748" offset="10253655">I think I heard Mr. Strauss say that the Commission at this point is satisfied that the risk is not such as to preclude further licensing of nuclear power plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.242" offset="10303602">What he then added was that if the risk is deemed to be at some other point, the Commission might make the decision not to license in certain cases where there was not a clear need for power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.733" offset="10397538">Incidentally, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has adopted subsequent to the S-3 rule a rule that the class nine reactor core meltdown accidents be considered in the context of environmental impact statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.176" offset="10487295">So in response to your question, Mr. Chief Justice, we are engaged in the activities of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in some very fine assessments of what degree of risk is acceptable in the licensing of nuclear power plants, and those issues, as I say, are sent out to the licensing boards for review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.824" offset="10585933">We have drawn the Court's attention to the problem with the original and the interim rule in this case that the health, socio-economic and cumulative impacts of the fuel cycle are screened from review as those original and interim rules were phrased.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.514" offset="10708708">The Commission acknowledged this deficiency by amending the Table S-3 rule to make clear that these health, socio-economic and cumulative impacts could be considered.</text>

            <text syncTime="2673.705" offset="10825424">--Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the matter was drawn to the attention of the Commission at the time of the interim rulemaking, and it was not for two years that the Commission got around to amending the thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.386" offset="10892193">So the matter was being litigated before the Commission for some time before the amendment took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.524" offset="10912777">This case is not about the propriety of generic rulemaking, nor about the wisdom of building nuclear power plants in the face of uncertainty regarding nuclear waste disposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.375" offset="10992085">Essentially, it is a case about the Commission's prolonged attempted to isolate the problems of nuclear waste disposal from the problem of deciding whether it is worth it in any particular instance to license a plant that will create substantial amounts of additional waste.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.961" offset="11074527">Nothing in the Vermont Yankee decision of this Court which was explicit in its recognition of the problems of high-level waste disposal suggests that an agency has discretion under NEPA to exclude significant environmental uncertainties and risks from the NEPA decision-making process when it comes to licensing particular nuclear plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.387" offset="11188212">The law requires disclosure of these uncertainties, and the Commission inexplicably refused to do so despite its recognition of their significant nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.648" offset="11237218">The issue here which Congress had made all the more important by its heavy reliance in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act on use of NEPA analysis is maintaining the integrity of the NEPA process based on clear, candid disclosure and consideration of the significant environmental risks of creating high-level waste in the licensing of particular nuclear power plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.090" offset="11351007">For the reason stated today and as summarized in our brief, the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed.</text>
