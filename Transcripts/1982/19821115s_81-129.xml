            <text syncTime="9.723" offset="131157">This case comes to the Court on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.314" offset="161459">The respondent is a permanent resident alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.005" offset="176297">She made a brief visit to Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.373" offset="189776">On her return to the United States, she was denied admission by the Immigration and Naturalization Service after an exclusion hearing and a determination that she had attempted to smuggle aliens across the border.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.037" offset="252365">Respondent petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in the Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.774" offset="275353">The District Court vacated the INS's decision and ordered it to proceed against respondent, if at all, only in a deportation proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.496" offset="318194">The Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.389" offset="329792">In the opinion filed today, we reverse and hold that a permanent resident alien returning to this country from a brief visit abroad is not a statutory matter entitled to a deportation proceeding rather than an exclusion hearing to determine whether the alien is excludable.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.924" offset="419967">We hold, however, that in the circumstances of this case, the alien is entitled to due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.678" offset="446925">We remand to the Ninth Circuit to determine what procedures are required in the exclusion hearing and whether a respondent was accorded due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.941" offset="487990">Justice Marshall has filed a separate opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.</text>
