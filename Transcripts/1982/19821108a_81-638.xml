            <text syncTime="15.807" offset="199434">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="21.100" offset="220541">This case involves the issue of whether regulations promulgated by Pennsylvania's prison authorities create the expectation of a liberty interest in prisoners, requiring due process before a prisoner can be transferred from general population to administrative segregation pending the completion of an investigation into a riot at the state prison in Huntington, Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.402" offset="337779">On December 3rd, 1978, a group of inmates attempted to force their way into the control center of the institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.243" offset="373096">A riot ensued.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.242" offset="377171">Several guards were injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.568" offset="386471">It was necessary to call upon the Pennsylvania State Police, local law enforcement agencies, and additional corrections personnel to quell the disturbance.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.800" offset="419385">The prison authorities immediately initiated an investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.063" offset="440388">They segregated the suspected participants and attempted to restore order to the institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.218" offset="465047">The Respondent was one of 18 inmates suspected of direct involvement in the riot and of assaulting corrections officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.322" offset="505485">The following day, December 4, 1978, the Respondent was given a copy of a misconduct report charging him with the assault on officers and conspiracy to disrupt prison operations by attempting to take over the institution's control center.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.409" offset="577792">On December 8, 1978, he was given a hearing, at which he appeared, and it was determined that the investigation was incomplete, that he should remain in administrative segregation pending the completion of the investigation, and a further review of his status was scheduled for January 2nd, 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.041" offset="664309">On that day, Respondent was present at a hearing before the program review committee, where it was decided that his status should remain unchanged pending completion of the ongoing investigation by the Pennsylvania State Police.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.721" offset="727003">On January 19, 1979, the Respondent was charged specifically with a second misdemeanor in connection with an assault upon Sergeant Phillips, a corrections officer, on December 3rd, 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.934" offset="791891">Within three days, on January 22nd, 1979, he was given a hearing, at which he was present, and determined to be guilty of the second misconduct charge and thereby confined to disciplinary segregation for a period of six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.693" offset="858974">The sources of a liberty interest are our Fourteenth Amendment, which protects life, liberty and property, and in this particular case we focus on liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.985" offset="908084">The cases of Meachum and Montanye support our Pennsylvania position that administrative custody is within the normal range of a lawful conviction and sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.215" offset="956985">The residue of liberty in the inmate after a lawful conviction and a lawful sentence does not include any right to remain in the general population of the prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.678" offset="1014873">The fact that changes are adverse to an inmate does not give that inmate a right to due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.986" offset="1044130">A liberty interest can be created by statute or by regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.719" offset="1067013">We focus on regulation in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.467" offset="1086030">To create that liberty interest, there must be a clear and explicit and direct mutual expectation that a liberty interest is to be created, and the state must be bound to do or to refrain from doing something that can be determined by objective standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.787" offset="1167323">Prison authorities must have the latitude to exercise discretion in carrying out their duties and responsibilities inside these prisons.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="267.751" offset="1207134">General Zimmerman, would you tell us what section of the Pennsylvania Code, or sections, you believe governed the proceedings in this instance against the prisoner?</text>

            <text syncTime="282.887" offset="1267738">Your Honor, the relevant sections, we believe, are first Section 107... 107 appears at page 46 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.601" offset="1310579">107 is a general policy statement of when to use administrative custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.332" offset="1345478">In order that the prisons remain safe, the officials must have the discretion and the latitude to segregate inmates in order to maintain that security and safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.498" offset="1398141">There are times, and the list is contained in 95.107, where an individual who poses a threat to other inmates must be segregated, or a threat to staff, or to himself, or he poses an escape risk, or he needs protection himself from other inmates.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.724" offset="1475046">Now, I think that 107 is the first section that's relevant here in our inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.738" offset="1499078">But then, of course, it's necessary to go to Section 95.104(b)(3), which is page 43 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.077" offset="1540456">And that too represents a policy statement for when to use administrative custody, for investigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.714" offset="1566997">And that was the focus in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.746" offset="1575147">There was an investigation under way.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.776" offset="1587268">The court said that prison society is different from society at large--</text>

            <text syncTime="384.204" offset="1672949">Do you feel that the Illinois regulations at issue in Hughes against Rowe were in any respect very different from the Pennsylvania regulations at issue here?</text>

            <text syncTime="397.917" offset="1727807">--Your Honor, in Hughes v. Rowe, in reading the case the key unclear point was the effect of administrative segregation in those regulations in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.271" offset="1785276">One opinion noted that the administrative segregation appeared to result in a loss of good time, which certainly we would then concede puts it within Wolff.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.219" offset="1825087">However, if the record does not reflect any serious security problem or if that administrative segregation... and this is Hughes, in my opinion... administrative segregation was for investigative purposes, we feel that it's in that sense similar to our case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1949.618" offset="7934605">Here they were filed on December 11th and, as we heard earlier, they were dismissed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1961.269" offset="7981207">In addition, Lieutenant Kyler, who was the charging officer and who had submitted two affidavits in this case, the second one appearing at page 82 of the joint appendix, indicated that he was informed to go ahead regardless of the status of the criminal case, to go ahead with the institutional disciplinary charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.666" offset="8062814">So my point being that the delay here I do not think was justified.</text>

            <text syncTime="2046.031" offset="8320277">Now, there has been a lot of discussion in the briefs concerning prison officials in a riot or on the even of an emergency should not be saddled with disciplinary procedures or procedural due process.</text>

            <text syncTime="2381.505" offset="9662135">And there this Court found procedural due process was required, even though the decision makers were some of society's most highly trained professionals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.377" offset="9701632">And some of the cases that I have cited in my brief indicated that where there has been rampant violence in an institution or situations of individual rapes that the custody decisions are being made on the basis of gut feelings or insufficient data, and that's what I think the Petitioners are asking for here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.945" offset="9799957">Procedural due process will guard or help guard against the possibility of disciplinary custody being labeled administrative, but without the procedural protections... exactly what happened in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2459.490" offset="9974141">In addition, if the prison official was not present at the initial decision it becomes crucial to understand what has happened in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.362" offset="10013638">Now, in my brief I also ask for the discretionary ability, the discretion being with the chairman of the hearing, to allow questioning by the inmate and compelling the attendance of witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.994" offset="10076123">Pennsylvania allows for that presently in its disciplinary system, and I cited in my brief a survey that shows that most jurisdictions or the majority of jurisdictions have some type of framework set up in the administrative custody--</text>

            <text syncTime="2829.578" offset="11454448">The Hoss case is a district court in 1978 that dealt with a single prisoner in confinement for five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.041" offset="11500319">And we feel that that decision relating to one prisoner has no precedential impact or binding effect, and we urge this Court to reject that reasoning in the Hoss case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.193" offset="11552982">And in connection with the reference to the I.C.U. consent decree, the consent decree was in the nature of a class action, styled as a class action and a general challenge to prison conditions, and it was settled by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in a consent decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.560" offset="11634380">Now, it's our position that the genesis of the regulation is not relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.587" offset="11670533">It's the clear and precise language of the regulation in Pennsylvania examined that does not create the mutual expectation that is necessary for a liberty interest.</text>
