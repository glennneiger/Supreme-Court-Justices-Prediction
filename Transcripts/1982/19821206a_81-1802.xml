          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="4.385" stopTime="293.074">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="4.385" offset="164916">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case is here on the government's petition for a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.658" offset="202010">The issues in this case began when a drug task force in Minnesota was investigating the activities of one of Respondent's co-conspirators, one Armstrong, who they had reason to believe was engaged in the manufacture of illegal drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.987" offset="287378">They acquired information that Armstrong was making purchases of certain precursor chemicals used in the manufacture of amphetamine from a particular drug company, and with the cooperation... or chemical company... and with the cooperation of that company, they placed a beeper or radio transmitter in a false bottom in a five-gallon container of chloroform which Armstrong was scheduled to pick up.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.972" offset="391345">Armstrong came to the chemical company, picked up the chloroform, loaded it in his car, and was then followed by physical visual surveillance to the home of co-defendant Petschen, where the container was seen to be transferred into Petschen's vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.302" offset="472638">Petschen then left and was followed both visually and with the use of the beeper as he drove from Minnesota to Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.395" offset="528958">At one point during his travels on the road, the officers lost both visual and beeper contact, but they regained it while he was still in the course of his trip, and then they lost it for a second time.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.987" offset="591339">At that point, with the aid of an aircraft, and after the passage of perhaps a half an hour to an hour, the beeper was located emitting signals from the property of Respondent Knotts.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.414" offset="649122">There followed a visual surveillance over the course of a couple of days, and then a warrant, search warrant was obtained to search the property and the search disclosed a clandestine laboratory to manufacture these chemicals, and of course the chloroform container which contained the beeper and various other precursor chemicals.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.846" offset="742849">The issue in this case is whether a warrant is required to monitor the signals emitted by a beeper from a container that has arrived at an individual's property.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.154" offset="787988">The answer to this question involves potentially two different kinds of inquiries.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.022" offset="807528">First, whether the use of this investigative technique is a search or seizure at all, regulated by the Fourth Amendment, and if the answer is no, that would, I think, end this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.747" offset="846398">Secondly, if it is a search or seizure, what quantum of suspicion must exist to support the use of this technique, and must such use be accompanied by a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.804" offset="894673">Now, before turning to these issues, I would like to tell the Court briefly something about how beepers or beacons, as they are called, operate, and how they are used.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.260" offset="936468">It is basically an FM transmitter that emits a radio signal which, when monitored, discloses the location of the beeper.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.366" offset="972831">There are some beepers, not the one in this case, that will also disclose when the package is being moved or opened.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.055" offset="1003655">A beeper is a fairly expensive device.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.407" offset="1017030">I am told it costs somewhere between $700 and $1,200.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.626" offset="1029882">The kind of beeper used in this case is fairly small.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.661" offset="1042108">It weighs about a half a pound, and is about three inches long.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.898" offset="1063006">There are essentially two ways in which these devices are used.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.952" offset="1083172">One is attached to a vehicle or vessel, car, plane, or boat, for purposes of following the movements of that, and the second is placed in some way inside a container or other object.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.026" offset="1131551">Now, in either case, the basic purpose of this device is to be employed as an aid to surveillance to track movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.382" offset="1172929">Now, the container beeper is sometimes employed for an additional purpose, in addition to tracking the movement, which is to determine whether the object, the container remains located at a particular place or, as I mentioned, in some instances, whether it has been opened.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.112" offset="1255894">Now, car beepers are useful in a wide variety of cases, kidnapping cases, espionage cases, extortion cases, any kind of case where visual surveillance might be important.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.955" offset="1315244">The container beeper--</text>

            <text syncTime="424.855" offset="1846784">What was held to be improper by the court of appeals was the monitoring of the beeper while it was on the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.092" offset="1871757">The only piece of information that was used, that was garnered from the beeper that was relevant to the search warrant application, and this is a fruits case... nobody questions that the warrant itself was supported by probable cause... was the knowledge that the container of chloroform was on Respondent Knotts's property.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.236" offset="1952318">Now, the beepers are, as I say, expensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.457" offset="1973216">Their use is hardly an everyday occurrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.826" offset="1982725">Its use is usually accompanied by airplane surveillance, car surveillance by a number of agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.230" offset="2004354">But although it is not frequent, it is hard to estimate its utilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.800" offset="2026610">It is absolutely essential in investigations like this that the existence of surveillance not be discovered by the suspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.406" offset="2060988">And in this case, as in many others, suspects do use counter-surveillance techniques, erratic driving, sudden U-turns, and various other things to try to detect the presence of and to throw off visual surveillance.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.880" offset="2114904">With the use of the beeper, you do not need to maintain eye contact with the vehicle that you are following and are able to mount a more effective surveillance of the public movements of the car on the highway.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.871" offset="2162865">Also in the drug manufacturing cases such as this, it is common practice for the suspects to acquire chemicals gradually, store them at various locations, move them from place to place.</text>

            <text syncTime="764.493" offset="3205360">The problem arose because they lost track of the vehicle and of the beeper, and by the time they turned it on, it was situated on Knotts's property, and the court in effect takes a strict liability position, that the government has no way of knowing, of course, where the container is, because only by using the beeper do you find that, but the government is out of luck if when they use the beeper the container is then located on private property.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.977" offset="3311313">Now, the situation that Respondent wishes to analogize this case to is the situation in which a beeper is used to monitor, let's say, the continued presence over an extended period of time of a container inside somebody's house, or to monitor such activity inside somebody's house as the opening of a container.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.175" offset="3408070">Those things are different, because those are not public events, and arguably those things would properly be classified as a search under the Katz test.</text>

            <text syncTime="1677.975" offset="6859264">First of all, in their main brief, they assert that neither the history nor the language of the Fourth Amendment reflects any intention to require warrants as a precondition to a lawful search and seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.132" offset="6911926">Now, it is difficult for me to imagine any constitutional rule which has been established by this Court other than that searches without warrants are per se unreasonable, subject only to a few specifically established and well delineated exceptions, none of which, by the way, are claimed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.529" offset="6993533">Second, in their reply brief, the government strongly criticizes an observation which we made in our main brief to the effect that if this Court allows warrantless beeper monitoring in any situation, which is in essence what the government is asking for here, that rule would allow virtually unlimited monitoring of our private lives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.346" offset="7096769">Pursuing that, in their reply brief, the government suggests that what we are attempting to do is to divert the inquiry which is made in this case into a question of potential for abuse, further accuses us of conjuring up what they call a pessimistic vision of police activities which is far removed from reality.</text>

            <text syncTime="2918.007" offset="11819394">I would like to comment just briefly on a couple of things that came up during the government's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.742" offset="11922421">First, Mr. Frey has asserted that in cases like this, in other words, drug manufacturing cases, beepers are essential.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.965" offset="11967247">I have no doubt as to the accuracy of that statement, but that certainly is no justification and no reason for claiming that it is difficult to get a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.773" offset="12014477">Secondly, the government asserts that all that was learned through use of the beeper was that Mr. Petschen went to the cabin after they lost surveillance contact with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.652" offset="12086052">I think it is important to note that in this case, the basis of the search warrant was the fact that the beeper drum had been... had become stationary at the Respondent's residence, and that was one of the bases upon which they obtained the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.398" offset="12165046">I want to make it clear that we do not necessarily concede that merely because Petschen may have arrived at Knotts' property, even assuming that the state agent saw that, that that would have established probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.675" offset="12230144">One thing that also came up during the government's argument in questioning by Justice O'Connor, your questions to the effect that, does it make any difference where the beeper drum is located on the property for purposes of determining whether or not there was constitutional protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.213" offset="12356263">It would be our position in this case that once the drum was on the curtilage of this property, which, as the record shows, contained No Trespassing signs on the front and was in a secluded area, it doesn't make any difference whether the drum was located inside the house, close to the house, or any place else in the curtilage.</text>

            <text syncTime="3386.761" offset="13694464">And I assume in that case if the alarm went off, that would show that you were using the chemical drum for... or at least opening it presumably for illegal purposes, and I think that a warrant would be required under that situation as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.770" offset="13754545">In conclusion, ever since this Court's decision in Boyd versus the United States, the Court has recognized that the Fourth Amendment was primarily enacted to protect the citizens' indefeasible right of personal security, personal liberty, and private property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.553" offset="13841585">In his famous dissent in the Olmstead case, Justice Brandeis elaborated on the concept of privacy in dissenting over the warrantless use of electronic surveillance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.026" offset="13891531">He wrote essentially that whenever and however the government unjustifiably intrudes upon a citizen's privacy, the Fourth Amendment is violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.418" offset="13937089">Now, ever since Olmstead, much constitutional doctrine has changed, but I don't think the wisdom of Justice Brandeis's dissent has, and neither has the rule that searches without warrants are presumptively invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.213" offset="14008246">We submit that what took place in this case was a search, that there is no basis for distinguishing it from any other search on the grounds that it was minimally intrusive, and therefore a warrant should have been required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.139" offset="14068015">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3483.657" offset="14082016">Just briefly, I want to make an important point, if I can come to something more mundane than my colleague closed on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.261" offset="14104482">If you are going to require a warrant, presumably you have determined that probable cause is necessary to use this investigative technique.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.517" offset="14141471">The problem you are confronted with is like the all or nothing problem in Terry against Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.505" offset="14161428">If automatically... if you call it a search, it requires probable cause, the question is whether it is reasonable to bar the government from using this aid to surveillance techniques, keeping in mind that most kinds of physical surveillance do not require any kind of reasonable suspicion or probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.549" offset="14233631">Is it reasonable to insist that the government have probable cause to believe that a crime is being committed and that this is being used, or is it satisfactory and adequately protective of individual interests, balancing the intrusion against the societal needs to allow this to be conducted on reasonable suspicion?</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.178" offset="14304162">That is involved in the decision of whether or not a warrant is to be required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.646" offset="14322029">Finally, if I can come back to the question that Justice Stevens asked about the installation of the beeper, installation of the beeper is not a search, and I don't think it's a seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.370" offset="14364870">It does not disclose to government eyes or ears or knowledge any fact, any information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.691" offset="14390157">It is an act.</text>
