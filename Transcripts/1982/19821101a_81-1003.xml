          <turn speaker="laurence_h_tribe" startTime="85.685" stopTime="252.476">
            <label>Mr. Laurence H. Tribe</label>
            <text syncTime="85.685" offset="495085">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.028" offset="500414">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="88.995" offset="508250">This case is about a Boston executive order which applies to construction work on projects for which the city makes the construction contract and provides public revenues either from taxes that the city itself raises or from funds that the city procures from the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.720" offset="607202">To the extent feasible, at least half the jobs that the city creates on these projects must go to city residents, and the issue is whether the Constitution forbids giving residents this priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.120" offset="660805">Let me stress that the question is not whether the city may divert pre-existing private jobs from nonresidents to residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.632" offset="702810">The only question is the allocation of publicly subsidized jobs that the city itself generates with its own foresight and industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.549" offset="750458">Now, that foresight and industry by a city confronting urban decay and unemployment may take two main forms: First, it may take the form of focusing the city's political energy on raising enough local tax revenues to generate the needed jobs in classical public works projects, like schools and roads; and secondly, it may take the form of focusing political energy on attracting enough federal aid to the city's coffers to induce private firms in accord with the terms of whatever federal grant is obtained to create needed jobs in the construction of housing or other forms of urban renewal.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.639" offset="934882">Boston has done both of these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.451" offset="946062">And I should like to begin with the second, with the attraction of federal funds, since I think that is the more innovative and the more controversial.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.791" offset="979499">Urban renewal projects that are made possible by efforts made by the City of Boston to attract the federal aid that such projects need are just as much the product of the city's collective political exertions as are the schools and the streets that the city funds through local taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.405" offset="1085974">Indeed, the State Supreme Court, whose judgment is being reviewed here, said both in its opinion and in the judgment of that Court, that all projects covered by the executive order, in its words, are "city-funded construction projects".</text>
            <text syncTime="249.352" offset="1149713">That's all the judgment at page A-17.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="252.476" offset="1162252">Mr. Tribe, under that line of reasoning, wouldn't it be possible to say that the decision of the Hilton Corporation to build a new Hilton on Copely Square might be thought to be the result of the city's ingenuity, too?</text>
            <text syncTime="264.659" offset="1210944">I suppose city efforts to into that.</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence H. Tribe</label>
            <text syncTime="266.362" offset="1217736">Well, in this case, Justice Rehnquist, the key point is that the city is a but-for cause under the very terms of the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.483" offset="1246262">Under 42 U.S. Code section 5318(j), Secretary of HUD must find a strong probability that the whole private development would not occur but for the specific federal funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.478" offset="1314180">Now, if it could really be shown that in a particular case a mix of public and private funds is the direct result under the terms of the federal statute, the direct result of a city process, a complicated process of holding local hearings and then lobbying for a grant, then our reasoning would apply.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="312.375" stopTime="325.118">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="312.375" offset="1401847">Well, what if it were strictly private funds but the city had been very active in persuading the persons who had the disposition to private funds to use them in Boston rather than Minneapolis?</text>

          <turn speaker="laurence_h_tribe" startTime="325.118" stopTime="361.667">
            <label>Mr. Laurence H. Tribe</label>
            <text syncTime="325.118" offset="1452734">I suppose that that would push our logic beyond the point where I would urge the Court to take it.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.726" offset="1475199">That is, we are not suggesting that any time the city deserves a pat on the head for having something happen that the city can then parcel things out in a partial way.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.222" offset="1517204">We are saying that when the federal program itself identifies a special role for cities to solve problems of severe economic distress, and to do so by attracting indispensable federal money, then at least the jobs on that project are indistinguishable from jobs that are funded by municipal bonds or by other things.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="361.667" stopTime="377.692">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="361.667" offset="1599019">Well, why should the city stand any better if it applies its regulation to things that it had no part in funding but was federally funded, but it nevertheless had a great part in producing on the scene, than should the privately funded things that it had the same great part in producing?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="laurence_h_tribe" startTime="377.692" stopTime="537.846">
            <label>Mr. Laurence H. Tribe</label>
            <text syncTime="377.692" offset="1663071">Well, I suppose the judgments of degree here are ones that this Court might well leave to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.534" offset="1686477">And Congress has drawn that line; that is, in the relevant statute, the Housing and Urban Development Act, Congress specifically said that with respect to these projects, not only is it indispensable that the city and the developer specify that the project couldn't occur otherwise, but once the project is funded it is a requirement under the statute that to the greatest extent feasible, at least as to the job opportunities that are made available on the project, that those go to residents of the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.519" offset="1830360">And it seems to me when Congress has made that judgment, there is no reason in the name of the Commerce Clause or any other provision of the Constitution for the Court to worry about remote hypotheticals in which the city might someday make a broader argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.357" offset="1893785">Here I think what is remarkable about what the City of Boston has done is not that it is in fact reserving to its citizens half the jobs on these public works projects and urban renewal projects, but that notwithstanding the fact that the city plays the indispensable role of generating all these jobs, it is willing to let nonresidents have half of them even though the federal statute and the federal regulations say that to the maximum extent feasible the jobs should go to local residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.437" offset="2018023">So it seems to me as far as the federally funded portion is concerned, when the city goes and gets the money from the Federal Government by showing that it is needed to resolve problems of severe economic distress, that at that point there is no basis for drawing a constitutional distinction based on where the money came from.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.085" offset="2104645">Now, I do want to suggest, though, that any notion that somehow the city is trying to pyramid this power into a broad takeover of the private sector on the rationale that the city has played a key role after all, but for the innovation of the city, the whole private sector might be less well off.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.343" offset="2181654">Any such notion should be dispelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.296" offset="2189491">We are talking here about approximately 11 percent of the construction that is going on in the City of Boston, and we are talking about two kinds of construction: classical, traditional public works construction funded entirely by the city as to which I have yet to see an argument on behalf of the respondents as to why the preference is impermissible; and somewhat more innovative urban development projects that have to be tailored to the needs of the neighborhood.</text>

            <text syncTime="544.031" offset="2328462">It... it suggests if you turn to page, I believe it is, A. 42 in the petition for certiorari, the appendix to the petition, we know that $483 million approximately is the total construction, at least in the fairly typical year of 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.804" offset="2419473">Of that amount, $54 million was covered by the executive order.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.583" offset="2438595">And of that $54 million, $34 million represented projects that in some way or other involved urban development action grants.</text>

            <text syncTime="578.565" offset="2466598">--But we don't know how, we don't know if the city was signatory or what.</text>

            <text syncTime="583.531" offset="2486451">Well, we know that the city does not in fact... the city does not in fact sign the construction contract on the hotel and other purely private-seeming parts of the project.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.855" offset="2531695">The city signs the construction contract on infrastructural parts, such as those that are paid for by about $4 million of the $18 million Copely Place grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.193" offset="2573073">But the reason that I press the point to discuss the entire urban development action grant picture is that no ambiguity about the record on that point could possibly justify the judgment that is being reviewed in this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="627.826" offset="2663561">Well, actually, it was in the Complaint, it was in the Complaint made against the city; that is, the Complaint quoted some of these regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.840" offset="2683623">And it has always been puzzling to the city why the plaintiffs in this case would have relied, in part, on federal regulations which seems to us fully vindicate everything the city is doing with respect to the federally funded portion in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.456" offset="2754154">And it is for that reason that we have seen this case as principally about city-funded in the traditional limited sense, city-funded public works projects, and the question whether as to those projects it is permissible after this Court's precedents in Hughes and Reeves were the preference.</text>

            <text syncTime="683.975" offset="2888214">It was certainly not mentioned in the questions presented, although the questions presented are broad enough to encompass it potentially; that is, tax-supported public works employment, I would think, after this Court's decision in cases like United Transportation Union v. Long Island, ought not to be interpreted in a static historical sense; that is, public works need not take the form of roads and parks and schools, they can take the form in the modern period when the needs of a given decaying urban area require an infusion of outside funds for shopping centers, and it can take that form as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.680" offset="3023006">And so the same fundamental issue is presented, and indeed in the petition elsewhere we discuss the reason that we did not think it made any difference if some of the funds were federal, on page 20 and 21 of the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.410" offset="3081938">But it seems to me that the Court need only reach the question whether public works projects, however precisely defined, funded by city funds, raised in a variety of ways, can be so administered that at least half the work crews on those projects are required to be Bostonians, members... residents of the city... I say "members" having just heard that colloquy about membership... residents of the city to the extent feasible.</text>

            <text syncTime="848.347" offset="3545664">And indeed, in the Copely Place UDAG, urban development action grant, which is described and relied on heavily by the other side, at page 137 of the grant application it is specified that all the contractor need do is take reasonable measures, every reasonable possible measure, to achieve compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.278" offset="3625390">But if the contractor can't do it because insufficient qualified workers are available, he is excused.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.758" offset="3655378">So it seems to me clear that if it's administered in a way that is not only parallel but completely convergent... and understandably, because the point is the city couldn't get these federal grants without conforming its detailed reading of the 50 percent rule to the requirements of federal law... if anything, the only colorable argument I could imagine about any tension with federal law, I could imagine the Department of Housing and Urban Development saying, what do you mean just 50 percent: we say that to the extent feasible you've got to target these jobs to local residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.293" offset="3781498">And so it might be said that by feeling satisfied with giving one out of every two jobs to a Bostonian, the City of Boston is not doing as much as federal law might require, but I think here plaintiffs would not have standing to raise that issue in the Court below or in this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1057.203" offset="4381165">That's where this case is not silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.249" offset="4389315">What is silent here is the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.140" offset="4396838">But Congress by statute, and federal agencies by regulation, have specified that this money should be targeted to residents of the city that applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.103" offset="4440724">To the extent that's so, I would imagine that the thrust of the respondent's argument is that the City of Boston was insufficiently generous to the New England region by going out and getting federal grants that had this condition attached.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.786" offset="4491401">Perhaps Boston should have looked for some kind of federal grant which would benefit residents of New Hampshire or Rhode Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.971" offset="4516165">But so far as Boston has obtained money to supplement its tight fiscal situation from the Federal Government, it is surely impermissible to say that the silent Commerce Clause somehow overrides congressional regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.011" offset="4584397">If Congress were, however, to tell Boston, this is money that's available only if you use it to help people in western Massachusetts and perhaps in Rhode Island and Connecticut, it'd be up to Boston whether to accept that money or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.818" offset="4627551">We're not suggesting that this is an area so governmental, so close to that National League of Cities core, that Congress' spending power could not even have conditions imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.987" offset="4668302">But it does seem clear that nothing in the Commerce Clause prevents the city from using these federal dollars as it was intended that they be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.156" offset="4700903">Now, with respect to the public works projects themselves, I think it is conceded all, around and it seems to me it would have been conceded by the Court below, that if the public works jobs... the jobs rebuilding streets and parks and maybe little city halls... if they were filled through direct hiring by the city, if the city set up a bureaucracy to do public works construction, then the preference for residents as employees of the city would be constitutional under the decisions of this Court, such as McCarthy against Philadelphia Civil Service Commission in 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.469" offset="4838203">Indeed, I think that a fair implication, Justice Brennan, of your Shapiro opinion was that residency requirements for welfare would be perfectly acceptable; it was only the durational residency requirement that was... that was a difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.105" offset="4892747">So the problem here seems to be that rather than setting up an unwieldy bureaucracy to hire public works groups, the city has actually created a market for private firms to do some of that public works construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.380" offset="4945827">And it is said by the Court below that when the hiring operates through private firms rather than directly, that somehow that removes whatever immunity the city might have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.860" offset="4991698">Frankly, I fail to understand why that should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.984" offset="5004237">I can understand how in a case like Hickland the fact that the State of Alaska tried to use its hold over a scarce and important national resource like oil and gas to kind of trickle out into the entire private economy so that anyone who even supplied something to a subcontractor who had anything to do with the ripple effect of the Alaskan oil and gas was suddenly trapped by the preference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.347" offset="5109667">But nothing like that is happening here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2971.852" offset="12039744">At some point the city loses its market participant immunity, remembering that the market participant immunity is an exception in the first instance to the otherwise general and well established rule that cities and states are not entitled to throw up economic barriers in an attempt to isolate themselves from problems that are shared by all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.545" offset="12134516">But there's a second feature, Justice Rehnquist, and that is that the order attempts to preclude non-Boston residents and non-Massachusetts residents from work opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.743" offset="12195329">So to that extent as well, the city is reaching beyond the initial party with whom it has privity in an attempt to dictate conditions which they do not have a right to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.613" offset="12242768">One of the further basic defects of the executive order is that it invites retaliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.981" offset="12304208">If Boston is able to have a resident preference scheme such as this, then there is no reason why other cities and states would be precluded from doing the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="3087.133" offset="12500858">And in this respect, the Court's decision in Hicklin versus Orbeck provides the instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.037" offset="12524472">And there, when Alaska's hire statute was struck Alaska was not able to successfully argue that it has as a purpose, as Boston is arguing, an effort to alleviate unemployment, because there was no showing that the out of state residents were a source of the unemployment problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.559" offset="12602526">Rather, lack of job training and lack of education were.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.902" offset="12615901">And further, as in Hicklin, there is no showing that the order is targeted to address the problem before the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.179" offset="12661040">That is to say, all Boston residents, whether they're employed or not, are given a preference in the employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.019" offset="12696358">When... the order then contradicts the basic principles of this Court's decisions in Paul versus Virginia, which recognized there was a provision of the Constitution which so tended to constitute the people of this country, one nation, as that clause, and in Toomer versus Witsell, where this Court advised that the primary purpose of the clause was to help fuse into one nation what had been a collection of independent sovereign states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.615" offset="12834807">In sum, if we are to preserve our national economic free trade unit, then we must permit it to flourish without governmental restrictions on business and people who seek work opportunity without regard to their place of residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.999" offset="12900322">This Court's instruction in Philadelphia versus New Jersey is so very relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.541" offset="12934490">There, in striking New Jersey's statute, the Court held that, just as the commerce clause protected her neighbors today, so the commerce clause would protect New Jersey in the future from efforts by one state to isolate itself in the stream of interstate commerce from problems shared by all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.924" offset="13019963">Unemployment is a national problem and it can only be worsened by permitting retaliatory resident preference schemes, and which can only be alleviated by promoting the infrastructure and the instrumentalities of interstate commerce which are embodied in our private enterprise system.</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence H. Tribe</label>
            <text syncTime="3531.798" offset="14279483">A couple of points, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.061" offset="14288574">First of all, as to the impact on commerce, I do want to make it very clear that the record did not really leave it so ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.948" offset="14320129">The court below recognized that the provisions may have little impact on the industry or on its functioning in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.008" offset="14352312">It's just some firms that might be affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.039" offset="14360462">I think it's clear from Justice White's questions, and he may have been recalling Exxon v. Maryland, that adverse impact on some firms is not a constitutionally cognizable commerce clause violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.582" offset="14402676">And I just want to remind the Court that, even if there were adverse impact on commerce, we've argued that that impact would be amply justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.892" offset="14431829">Moreover, the record is clear that the data stipulated at page A-44, the data as to one month, December 1978, are representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.793" offset="14471431">And in that one month 93 percent of the firms would have been wholly unaffected by the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.322" offset="14497553">None of the 7 percent that were affected were from out of state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.055" offset="14508525">I don't think there's a viable commerce clause objection here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.867" offset="14519809">I think there also are some confusions that Respondents have spawned with respect to the federally funded part of all this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.161" offset="14548962">Justice White asked, isn't it true that the city signs the checks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.941" offset="14564113">I just want to say, it's entirely true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.736" offset="14571218">This is the city's month.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.533" offset="14578428">In the Copley Place project, for example, to say that there's no risk assumed by the city would be rather fanciful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.061" offset="14608521">As our reply brief points out at footnote 11, the grant is to the city, the city has simply loaned the money to the developer, and if it fails the city's loan becomes no good.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.462" offset="14650108">We're told in some vague way that there are other federal regulations, maybe of the Department of Transportation, that might be violated here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.240" offset="14685217">I haven't heard that since the complaint in this case, but the fact is that the DOT regulations just specify that there should be no discrimination against out of staters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.580" offset="14718654">And the Supreme Judicial Court in this case, as its reason for not finding a violation of privileges and immunities, said that it's clear that neither on its face nor in fact is this aimed chiefly at out of staters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.231" offset="14777272">Mr. Kingston says that there's something in the executive order before this Court that makes the order apply whenever the city goes out and applies for federal money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.835" offset="14823666">That's not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.601" offset="14826696">It's just not what the order says.</text>
            <text syncTime="3669.835" offset="14831607">What the order says is, the city must be a signatory to the construction contract, which it sometimes is as to these federal funds, but not always.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.863" offset="14859715">The federal regulations have not been amended since we filed our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.175" offset="14876956">You can rely on the version that we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.048" offset="14884479">And in fact, the statute does not say what the Respondents claim it says.</text>
            <text syncTime="3688.516" offset="14906422">12 U.S. Code Section 1701(u) does not require that the city become the employer of last resort and target the money at the unemployed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3699.870" offset="14951770">It says specifically that the jobs assisted under the program be given to lower income persons residing within the unit of government or the metropolitan area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3711.771" offset="14999418">So it seems to me quite clear that the regulations are complied with here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3719.128" offset="15028779">In your earlier argument you seemed to rest quite heavily on the proposition that Boston was entitled to have these jobs to take care of its unemployment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3729.140" offset="15068903">But isn't it an economic reality that for every body occupying a job in one place it means that a body in some other place doesn't have that job?</text>
