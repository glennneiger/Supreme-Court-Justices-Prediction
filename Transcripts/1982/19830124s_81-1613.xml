            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="92307">In the other case, Memphis Bank &amp; Trust Company is here on direct appeal from the Supreme Court of Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.571" offset="130550">The State of Tennessee imposed a tax on the net earnings of banks doing business within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.184" offset="160957">The bank tax defines net earnings to include income from obligations of the United States and its agencies but to exclude interest earned on the obligations of Tennessee and its political subdivisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.931" offset="223964">The appellant, Memphis Bank &amp; Trust Company brought a challenge in this Tennessee bank tax under 31 U.S.C. Section 742 and the Supremacy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.421" offset="277985">742 makes the obligations of the United States immune from state and local taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.837" offset="307556">The Supreme Court of Tennessee held that the bank tax does not violate this provision because the bank tax falls within the exception for nondiscriminatory franchise taxes set forth in Section 742.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.229" offset="377146">We disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.028" offset="384356">In an opinion filed today with the clerk, we hold that the Tennessee bank tax is "discriminatory" within the meaning of 742.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.555" offset="426465">A state tax is discriminatory if it imposes a greater burden on holders of federal property than on the holders of similar state property.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.293" offset="465440">The Tennessee bank tax discriminates in favor of securities issued by Tennessee and against federal obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.512" offset="502325">It does so by including in the tax base income from federal obligations while excluding income from comparable state and local obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.893" offset="551853">Accordingly, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Tennessee is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</text>
