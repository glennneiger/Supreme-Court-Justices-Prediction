            <label>Mr. Alan S. Meth</label>
            <text syncTime="102.753" offset="559980">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.018" offset="561025">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="105.423" offset="570638">This case is here under the certiorari from the Court of Appeals from the Ninth Circuit to review a decision of that court which held that California did not have the authority to regulate through licensing Indian country liquor transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.854" offset="632392">In so doing, the Court of Appeals reversed the judgment of the District Court which had upheld the right of California to regulate through licensing Indian country liquor transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.837" offset="680353">This case asked the Court to resolve two well-established and entirely distinct principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.254" offset="710028">On the one hand is the principle that Indians and Indian tribes are to be left free of state control and their affairs governed by themselves and by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.139" offset="757571">The other principle is that it is the states which have the authority to determine how liquor transactions within the state's borders are to take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.651" offset="803546">This case began about six years ago when Respondent, who is a tribal Indian living on a reservation in a northern part of San Diego County, the Pala Reservation, requested that she be allowed to sell distilled spirits from her general store, which is located on the Pala Indian Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.014" offset="901035">She made the request to the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, which has the authority under California law to require and enforce California's liquor licensing system.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.043" offset="953175">The Department denied Respondent's request for an exemption from California's liquor licensing laws, and Respondent then filed suit in the District Court seeking injunctive and declaratory relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.537" offset="1015138">And, the basis for that suit was that as a tribal Indian seeking to sell distilled spirits from her store located in Indian country she was exempt from California's liquor licensing laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.092" offset="1069368">The Department moved to dismiss the complaint or for summary judgment, and the District Court agreed with the Department that it had the authority to require licenses, and, therefore dismissed the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.132" offset="1129450">The case was then appealed to the Court of Appeals which, after a lengthy stay in that Court, reversed the decision of the District Court and held that California's liquor licensing laws as opposed to its state substantive laws had no impact in Indian country and need not be followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.625" offset="1219520">This case thus presents the question whether a state has the authority to require tribal Indians to obtain a state license if state law requires the license be obtained before liquor transactions take place in Indian country.</text>

            <text syncTime="349.374" offset="1546469">If it is punishable under the criminal system, Public Law 280 would give California the authority to punish that act criminally.</text>

            <text syncTime="414.235" offset="1805917">Before 1953 this question would not have arisen, for the simple fact that Indian country was dry.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.339" offset="1862341">Beginning in 1802, federal legislation prohibited the introduction of liquor into Indian country.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.430" offset="1894733">In 1832, the prohibitions were made criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.786" offset="1912078">So, under federal law, as well as state law, a number of states also regulated liquor transactions with Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.283" offset="1946142">Beginning in 1832, liquor transactions with Indians either on the reservation or off the reservation were prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.611" offset="1983445">The federal prohibitions are now contained in 18 U.S.C. Sections 1154 and 1156.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.823" offset="2016255">In 1953, Congress passed 18 U.S.C. Section 1161, which removed the federal criminal penalties unconditionally if the transaction occurred off the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.176" offset="2085636">With respect to on the reservation, acts or transactions occurring in Indian country, the federal penalties were removed conditionally, the conditions being that the acts or transactions had to conform both with the laws of the state in which the acts or transactions occurred and an ordinance duly adopted by the tribe having jurisdiction over that area of Indian country.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.996" offset="2185006">The Department asserted in the District Court and the District Court agreed that California had the authority to require Respondent to obtain a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.258" offset="2221995">Before I analyze Section 1161, with respect to what it actually says, I think it is very important for the Court to consider what the statute does not say in light of the Court of Appeals' decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.829" offset="2284271">The Court of Appeals' decision was based primarily on the concept of jurisdiction, and as I have indicated before, California is not asserting criminal or civil jurisdiction in the Public Law 280 sense under this statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="936.367" offset="3894459">The only authority, the only governmental entity which we know has jurisdiction over Indian country liquor transactions and, in fact, all acts committed on an Indian reservation is the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="961.796" offset="3996127">In this case, all we are saying, all California is saying is that it has the authority to set the conditions under which lawful Indian country liquor transactions are to take place, and if state law requires a license, just like if a tribal ordinance requires a license, then the person desiring to engage in liquor traffic in Indian country has to obtain a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.925" offset="4104692">That is all this case is about.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.469" offset="4110857">I suggest the proper way to analyze this case is the way this Court did in a number of cases cited in both of the briefs, California versus the United States, EPA versus State Water Resources Control Board, and Hancock versus Train.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.168" offset="4165610">In all three of those cases, the Court was faced with a situation where a state was requiring a federal agency to obtain a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.460" offset="4206779">In each of those cases, the Court looked at the statute, looked at the entire statutory scheme, looked at the legislative history and looked at anything else that the Court thought was relevant to this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.813" offset="4272189">But, the Court did not base its decision on the fact that a state does not have jurisdiction over the Secretary of Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.932" offset="4312731">Only if Congress has given a state the power to require the Secretary of Interior to obtain a license can a state make the Secretary of Interior obtain a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.834" offset="4372291">That is all we are asking for in this case is for the Court to look at the statute, look at the legislative history, look at the various relationships and determine whether California has the power to require a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.751" offset="4424013">I do not believe it would be fruitful at all for the Court to go into the matter of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.622" offset="4443448">The Court of Appeals seemed to assume that the California license was nothing more than a piece of paper, which simply allows someone to do an act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.381" offset="4514501">California's liquor licensing scheme is much more than that, and I do not believe that the Court's decision that only a state's substantive standards as opposed to its licensing scheme is a valid one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.623" offset="4575419">California both in its Constitution and in its statutes has declared that a licensing system is necessary for the protection of the health, welfare, safety and keeps the morals of its people, and the system is designed to eliminate what it views as the evils of unlicensed liquor traffic within the state.</text>

            <text syncTime="1684.558" offset="6887151">The state has taken inconsistent positions in this case as Mr. Meth has indicated, first asserting clear jurisdiction under this statute and then moving to a position where we are at today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.710" offset="6951830">The state is saying that this federal criminal statute incorporates an entire state licensing scheme as a condition for immunizing persons who engage in liquor transactions on Indian reservations to federal criminal prosecutions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1738.414" offset="7102609">The in conformity with language modifies the statement that acts or transactions within Indian country shall be in conformity with state law and with a tribal ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.468" offset="7158824">That in conformity with language is a convenient technique that Congress has used in other contexts, other contexts involving federal penal statutes, the Assimilated Crimes Act and the Major Crimes Act, to utilize state law as a standard for determining whether that conduct may or may not violate federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.146" offset="7253597">This Court in cases under other federal statutes, the federal Water Pollution Control Act and the federal Clean Air Act, where Congress has used language, shall conform with state law, has said that that means that state standards, state law would serve as standards for regulating federal facilities, but by no measure would require those facilities to obtain a state license.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.871" offset="7364460">When Congress passed this statute, its overriding concern was to eliminate discrimination against Indians in the sale of alcoholic beverages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.884" offset="7408555">So, it is reasonable to look at this statute and the act or transactions language and imply or assume that Congress was concerned about the sale or use of alcohol within Indian country, and by no means was concerned with matters such as licensing and taxation of liquor within Indian country.</text>

            <text syncTime="3159.830" offset="12788317">Our view is not that the distinction depends on whether something is embodied in a regulation or a state statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.329" offset="12818305">Let us be clear about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.517" offset="12827082">We suppose that for purposes of Section 1161 if the state of California delegates to an administrative agency the authority to enact a regulation proscribing terms of conduct in general terms not depending on whether or not you hold one of their licenses or not, that that is part of the state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.571" offset="12911301">If that state law is criminal, then California being a Public Law 280 state it may be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.331" offset="12942335">But, whether or not the state is a Public Law 280 state because it is part of the terms of state law which must be conformed to, the federal sanction does apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="3236.690" offset="13095726">Now, the state as... California has a system whereby certain acts are proscribed only through the licensing scheme, but should the state wish to, proscribe those acts in general terms, those would be incorporated within the Section 1161 structure.</text>

            <text syncTime="3380.367" offset="13670420">I think it is fair to say that the Court of Appeals did not base its holding on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.570" offset="13691213">It did not reject it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3388.552" offset="13703229">What we would lay emphasis on, Justice O'Connor, is the discretionary element.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.911" offset="13724650">It is important to understand that in operating a licensing scheme the state does not disavow the full range of discretionary powers that exist under a licensing scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.949" offset="13780761">It is useful to actually look at the California statutes and see what may happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.682" offset="13799673">For instance, when one applies for an Alcoholic Beverage Control Department license the duty of the Department is to determine whether the licensee is qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.083" offset="13841260">Among the things that must be taken into consideration are the results of an investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.599" offset="13867383">The Department is enjoined to investigate all matters affecting the public welfare or morals, and it has been held under California law that a license may be denied on the basis of a determination respecting these considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.965" offset="13924852">The statute also incorporates other relatively vague criteria.</text>

            <text syncTime="3449.307" offset="13946168">But, suppose those criteria were made specific, such as you cannot get a license if you are convicted of a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.509" offset="13966962">Another state, not California, has a law that you cannot sell liquor if you have been convicted of a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.366" offset="13990472">That law could be enforced in the other state but not California, as I understand it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3463.459" offset="14002802">Yes, Justice Stevens, and I would draw an analogy here to the Court's decision in the Grendel's Den case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.410" offset="14034566">If a state chooses to make its criteria unconditional then those criteria come outside the realm of discretionary administration and then they are part of the laws of the state for purposes of Section 1161.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.527" offset="14091095">If the state makes the choice to insist on retaining discretion to sort these factors out for itself then the consequence under Section 1161 is that that is not part of the law of the state.</text>

            <text syncTime="3628.377" offset="14662446">I think it is reasonably clear from Section 1161 that a state has the, what Mr. Schwartz called the remarkably intrusive authority of telling an Indian reservation that it cannot sell liquor at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.820" offset="14740291">The way that a state has that authority is by making the entire state dry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3652.133" offset="14757531">In 1953, there were two states that were actually dry, Mississippi and Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.880" offset="14780519">The Court on a number of occasions has said that if a governmental entity has a greater power, it also has all of the lesser powers included within that greater power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.266" offset="14830047">Two early 21st Amendment cases, Ziffrin, Inc. v. Reeves and State Board of Equalization v. Young's Market Co. cited in our briefs indicate that a state has the authority under the 21st Amendment to totally prohibit the introduction of liquor within the state, and if a state has that authority it has the authority to strictly control how liquor is to be distributed within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3696.880" offset="14936522">Another case, a recent Indian case, Merrion v. Jicarilla Apache Tribe... and I hope I pronounced it correctly... the Court dealt with the question of whether a tribe could exclude nonmembers, and the Court said that the power to exclude nonmembers from the reservation included the power to condition entry onto reservation land, to condition the continued presence on Indian land, and also condition reservation conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3729.227" offset="15065881">If a state has the greater power to totally prohibit liquor within Indian country, I do not understand why the distinction has to be drawn that some laws, lesser laws should be followed but other lesser laws should not be followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3748.466" offset="15142785">If a state under Section 1161 has the greater power, it should also have the lesser power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3754.183" offset="15165669">In summary, California is only asserting that it has concurrent authority with the tribes and with the United States to control liquor traffic in Indian country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3766.666" offset="15215615">We are not asserting that because of California's licensing laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3769.726" offset="15227840">Those laws are exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3771.380" offset="15234527">Section 1161 gives the United States the authority to criminally prosecute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3777.440" offset="15258769">Section 1161 also gives certain responsibilities to the state... to the tribes, and if the powers to the tribe include the power to license, all California is saying that that statute with the words both and the words in conformity with, and the words laws of the state includes the same powers to the state.</text>
