            <text syncTime="15.354" offset="197829">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.806" offset="219667">A simple straightforward issue is being presented today for your review.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.008" offset="236490">The issue is whether a county may constitutionally receive a representative to its state house of representatives based merely upon its status as a county and without regard to its population.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.158" offset="297094">In addition to other legal considerations which will be presented in argument, it is important that the Court have the benefit of a brief factual overview.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.512" offset="346517">When faced with the decennial task of reapportioning its legislative membership in 1981, the Wyoming State Legislature determined that the population of the state of Wyoming had grown by 3... pardon me... 137,141 persons, or in other words by 24 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.910" offset="436065">Each of the state's 23 counties had experienced a population growth but one, Niobrara County.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.281" offset="473577">Instead the population of that county had stabilized during the ten year period, from 1970 to 1980, at 2,924 persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.338" offset="517776">As introduced in the house, the 1981 Reapportionment Act provided for a membership of 63 members in the house of representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.413" offset="554139">A statutory ratio formula based upon population considerations was used to determine which counties would receive representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.066" offset="592695">Again--</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="115.457" offset="598233">Ms. Davidson, is this material which you are speaking of now in the record somewhere, or in the opinion of the District Court?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="suellen_l_davidson" startTime="122.595" stopTime="244.935">
            <label>Ms. Suellen L. Davidson</label>
            <text syncTime="122.595" offset="626864">--Yes, Mr. Justice, most of this material is in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.202" offset="641283">Based upon the statutory ratio formula each of the state's 23 counties, again with the exception of one, Niobrara County, would receive at least one representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.961" offset="700320">The 1981 Reapportionment Act then passed the house of representatives providing that the house membership would continue to be comprised of 63 members, but Niobrara County would be combined with its neighboring county of Goshen.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.346" offset="761864">The senate, however, changed the 1981 Reapportionment Act and instead provided that the house membership should be increased to 64.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.296" offset="797600">The additional representative would be awarded to Niobrara County.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.186" offset="817140">The Act then was committed to the conference committee where it soon became very apparent that the committee would be deadlocked and remain deadlocked unless a compromise was effected.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.413" offset="870116">Such a compromise was struck.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.506" offset="882446">The compromise was that Niobrara County would receive the 64th member.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.894" offset="908046">But at the same time too, if any court determined that the gratuitous grant of a representative to Niobrara County was unconstitutional, then Niobrara would be combined with Goshen County.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.842" offset="963843">There must have been a strong realization in the Wyoming State Legislature that there would be a strong possibility, a probability, that the provision would be struck.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.680" offset="1007206">In 1964, a three-judge panel, in the case of Schaefer versus Thomson, had already determined that Article 3, Section 3, of the Wyoming State Constitution was not to be applied in future instances involving apportionment of the Senate, for the article provided that each county would constitute a senatorial district.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.452" offset="1102292">And each county would, therefore, receive a senator.</text>

            <text syncTime="665.127" offset="2796908">Since the Court, in the 1964 case, Reynolds versus Sims, held that both houses of a bicameral state legislature must be apportioned on the basis of equal population, the reapportionment law has been more clearly defined in the 1973 cases of Gaffney versus Cummings, White versus Regester, and Mahan versus Howell.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.413" offset="2894083">The first two cases stand for the proposition that if the overall relative range of a reapportionment plan exceeds 9.9 percent, then a prima facie violation of the equal protection clause has been deemed to have occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.687" offset="2967226">The 9.9 percent hurtle in this case is very easy to jump.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.482" offset="2986348">The overall relative range of the 64 plan is 89 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.356" offset="3005887">But Mahan versus Howell goes one step further.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.620" offset="3022919">Even if the overall relative range exceeds the minimum 9.9 percent limitation, the state can save the reapportionment plan by showing that there are legitimate considerations incident to the effectuation of a rational state policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.222" offset="3097316">Basically a two-prong test applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.188" offset="3117169">First, is the state's policy furthered by plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.654" offset="3135037">And secondly, if it is, are there deviations... are the deviations within acceptable limitations?</text>
            <text syncTime="758.604" offset="3170877">This Court has found that neither history, topography, geography, sparseness of population, vastness of area, economic considerations like tax consequences or uniqueness, are factors which have been found to be rational state policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.050" offset="3248617">In Mahan, though, the integrity of maintaining political subdivisions was found to be a rational state policy, yet the overall relative range did not exceed 16.4 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.185" offset="3309221">The state of Wyoming, in this case, hangs its hat on the same sort of rational justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.260" offset="3341509">That is, that the maintenance of the integrity of political subdivisions saves the 64 plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.943" offset="3372229">There are other factual incidences, though, that differentiate this case from the Mahan case.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.986" offset="3404411">The first factor which is necessary to consider is that the Virginia General Assembly had been authorized by constitution not only to act general law, but to act specific or local law in regard to the government, organization and powers of cities, counties and towns.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.789" offset="3507647">That sort of authority is specifically prohibited by our Wyoming state constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.535" offset="3534606">No such authority is given to our Wyoming state legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.503" offset="3550488">Lastly, the Virginia plan produced the most minimal deviation possible while keeping the counties intact.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.108" offset="3600852">In Wyoming, in this case, there was no showing that the state of Wyoming had made an honest good-faith effort to produce the minimal deviations possible.</text>

            <text syncTime="1036.523" offset="4282544">And we find that in that instance that only has that county not maintained the original legislative grant... or in other words, number of representatives... of 11 that it had in 1970, but during the past decade, because of population shifts and such, it actually lost two representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.608" offset="4370837">You compare that to a situation where the county has grown four times that of the stagnant population of Niobrara and you see that there is a very substantial divergency that has occurred.</text>

            <text syncTime="1463.444" offset="5990220">The statutory formula told us that we needed to round to the nearest whole number, and any time that that whole number... pardon me... the ratio percentage could be rounded to the whole number of one, then the county would be entitled to a representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.000" offset="6060437">But in this case, the only way that Niobrara's percentage could be rounded was down to zero, so it deserved none.</text>

            <text syncTime="1706.568" offset="6962707">The reason that I contend that is because this Court has looked at that percentage deviation figure as an indicator, and a very important indicator, which shows just how close a state is coming to numerical equality in its apportionment decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.154" offset="7029058">But the Court has not invested that statistic with any particular significance, except in saying that if a plan deviates by less than then percent it is presumptively valid and there can't be threat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.195" offset="7089244">The reason there can't be a threat to majority control, if you have got less than ten percent is it's statistically highly improbable to have a minority dominating the legislature, if you've got less than ten percent deviation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.066" offset="7140757">If you have more than ten percent deviation, I suggest that we use the other standards that this Court has used in the past, and look at other statistical measures to see whether that indicator that says there's deviation between districts indicates some kind of fundamental impact, invidious impact upon the exercise fundamental right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.524" offset="7242531">This Court talked in Reynolds v. Sims and its companion cases, the one man, one vote rule means that the majority has to control the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.097" offset="7288820">That if a small minority such as 25 percent in Alabama or 18 percent in Maryland has a strangle hold on the legislature then other persons, the substantive rights of the majority are threatened.</text>

            <text syncTime="1816.445" offset="7402191">The reasons for that are that the number of representatives in the Wyoming house substantially exceeds the number of representative districts, a measure emphasized by this Court in Reynolds v. Sims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.018" offset="7456526">Further, the legislature is responsive to the majority even if we take, deliberately, a sample of the legislative districts in the state and take those that are most overrepresented, we still find 47 percent of the... not less than 47 percent can elect the majority.</text>

            <text syncTime="2250.522" offset="9138498">The opinion also talks about the nature and degree of the alleged injury and the arguments put forth by the state to justify the deviation from strict population equality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.234" offset="9205371">We certainly can't deny the existence of those statistics.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.653" offset="9219060">And the reasons for this disctricting decision I believe are more important in Wyoming than in Virginia or any other state whose apportionment plans have been reviewed to date.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.196" offset="9265244">Local governmentst in Wyoming, like local governments in most states particularly counties and school districts are charged with important public duties and provide essential public services and construction of public works and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.221" offset="9329296">What distiguishes Wyoming from most states is there are explicit and strict constituional limits on the abilities of counties to raise money whether taxing or borrowing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.981" offset="9380392">In comparing those limits to other states such as Delaware, Maryland even our neighboring states Montana and Colorado, we see that counties in other states have significantly greater ability to rasie revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.615" offset="9438906">In addition in wyoming we do not have provisions for county self rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.707" offset="9459282">In order for a county to obtain the necessary powers to deal with new growing situations and new needs such as we see in the mineral boom areas of Wyoming, they need help from the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.373" offset="9517900">If we look at every local government in Wyoming we see that they are unable to raise sufficient revenues to provide an acceptable level of public services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.681" offset="9559174">Accordingly, the legislature has enacted a number of supplemental revenue schemes to provide monies on a variety of criteria, not all of which are consistent, to help local governments, like counties and school districts, supply essential public services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.425" offset="9630122">Those political decisions to figure out what criteria should be used in revenue distribution, to determine which new taxes should be imposed, or in the case of school funding, to determine whether a greater share of local tax resources should be taken by the state and redistributed under new criteria, those decisions, of course, affect the very lifeblood of local government in Wyoming.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.473" offset="9754361">And those decisions, of course, are made in the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.690" offset="9767213">Quite simply, local government in Wyoming is dependent on the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.861" offset="9799918">There's a certain vulnerability of counties like Niobrara that is set forth in the record, that because of political decisions made in the state legislature, Niobrara County is contributing substantially more revenues in the forms of excise taxes and school foundations monies to the state, which is then distributed to other local governments throughout the state, than that county is getting back through those same distribution programs.</text>

            <text syncTime="2523.315" offset="10229685">For instance, Niobrara County taxpayers provide a good deal of oil and gas severance tax to the state, a lot more than they get back, whereas Goshen County is exactly the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.077" offset="10276705">Very little of that money goes to the state and they draw many hundreds of thousands of dollars of that money every year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.309" offset="10301678">The same analysis in greater numerical terms applies to school funding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.150" offset="10325084">Niobrara County contributes a substantial amount... by county I'm referring, of course, to the taxpayers and to taxes collected by the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.927" offset="10360193">That money goes to the state in a much greater proportion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.957" offset="10376284">As a matter of fact, there are no school funding supplements received by Niobrara County, whereas Goshen County receives on of the largest distributions of revenue from the foundation program, of any county.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.468" offset="10430305">And, in addition, Goshen County has gone to the legislature and gotten specific local apportionments to help them maintain their education system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.604" offset="10466877">To expect a representative to balance those competing considerations in a joint district like that is to really expect the impossible.</text>

            <text syncTime="2912.755" offset="11787419">Of course it is the appellant's position that the 89 percent overall relative range is a per se, if you will, violation of the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.526" offset="11854501">Greater clarification of the law has been made since the summary affirmance in Harrison versus Schaefer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.963" offset="11884281">An old outdated mode of measurement of vote dilution has been used or has been propounded by the state, that is, that a minority cannot control, basically, the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.660" offset="11951050">The most modern and accurate measurements are brushed to the wayside.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.500" offset="11970485">Overall relative range is found to have no significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.297" offset="11985636">And the same, too, with ratio.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.327" offset="11997757">Where is the breaking point?</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.201" offset="12009251">Appellants submit that it's somewhere around the 16.4 percent overall relative range mark that was set forth in the Mahan versus Howell case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.477" offset="12058361">Even more remarkable is the fact that that breaking point has been exceeded since the summary affirmance of Harrison versus Schaefer in the state of Wyoming.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.065" offset="12100679">First in the case... in the 1971 case, Thompson versus Thomsom and then, again, in this case Brown versus Thompson.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.812" offset="12139654">If you look at the administrative responsibilities which have been given to the counties as political subdivisions, you find that they are not so unlike the other administrative arms of states which are found in the majority of the states in these United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.599" offset="12218857">Some reliance, in almost all of those instances, is based on revenue and taxation considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.489" offset="12258354">But I ask the Court to remember that judicial remedies are available in those instances where a county may be discriminated in some manner by virtue of a vote that's taken on a tax bill or a revenue bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.807" offset="12323660">And then, if you will look, all in all, one 64th of a vote makes very, very little difference when it comes to a matter being considered typically on the floor of a legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.803" offset="12379667">One thing I think that this Court would find to be of interest is that there are... there is at least one instance in a combination district where the minority county provides the senator to the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.264" offset="12453541">And it's not to say that just because Goshen and Niobrara would be combined that Niobrara County would not in fact be the county which would be sending its representative if you will... a county representative, the local member, the district member, representative to the state house.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.520" offset="12538491">In Wyoming political subdivisions are no more nor no lessening, as I've already stated, than the majority of other counties found in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.455" offset="12590214">Niobrara County, in summary has judicial remedies available should it be found that it is a victim of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.967" offset="12624277">A one man-three vote principle as evidenced in this case is certainly unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.758" offset="12655520">Might the Court have any questions?</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.258" offset="12673492">Thank you, very much.</text>
