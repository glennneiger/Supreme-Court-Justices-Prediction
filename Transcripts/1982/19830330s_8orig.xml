            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="9.450" offset="130010">This -- this case began way back in 1952 when Arizona filed a motion for -- leave to file as a case against California to settle the respective shares of the Lower Basin States in the Colorado River.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.875" offset="219767">We appointed a Special Master who took evidence for several years and filed a massive report.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.008" offset="248292">The case was argued twice and finally opinion was announced in 1963 and a decree entered in 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.493" offset="290193">That decree settled the amount of water that the Upper Basin States were to deliver to the Lower and also settled the shares of the Lower Basin States among themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.496" offset="342229">The decree also determined the water rights of the Indian reservations in the Lower -- in the Lower Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.265" offset="385278">The -- we retained jurisdiction, however, for various reasons among others because the so-called presently perfected rights that would have priority had not yet been determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.135" offset="440762">Also, there were boundary disputes about the Indian reservations that still have to be finally determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.065" offset="488514">In 1979, we amended the decree when they -- when the presently -- present perfected rights have been determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.028" offset="524354">But meanwhile, the Indian tribes and later the United States moved to reopen the proceedings in two respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.520" offset="570330">First, it was alleged that in the proceedings leading up to the 1964 decree, the -- a fair amount of irrigable acreage had been mistakenly overlooked and that the -- then additional water rights were -- should be allocated to the reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.152" offset="664893">Secondly, it was said that the boundary disputes had been finally determined and that the -- the -- there was a good deal additional territory to be included in the Indian reservations and hence more water to be allocated.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.696" offset="727065">We appointed a Special Master who took a testimony and took up -- who heard the case and he recommended that in almost all respects the -- that we accept the claims of the tribes in the -- in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.742" offset="787251">Exceptions were filed and briefed and -- and argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.942" offset="808044">And now for the reasons stated in an opinion on file with the clerk, we sustain the exceptions of the -- of the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.197" offset="841063">We hold that the irrigable acreage issue was fully litigated and finally determined in the 1964 decree and was not subject to relitigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.842" offset="883590">Secondly, with some minor exception or two, we hold that because litigation is still pending with respect to the boundary disputes those boundaries have not yet been finally determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.730" offset="947120">Accordingly, we sustain the exception of the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.549" offset="958405">Justice Brennan joined by Justices Blackmun and Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.160" offset="980870">Justice Marshall took no part in the determination or consideration of the case.</text>
