            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="138982">We will hear arguments next in Elwood Barclay against Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.295" offset="160089">Mr. Nabrit, I think you can begin whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_m_nabrit_iii" startTime="50.355" stopTime="648.597">
            <label>Mr. James M. Nabrit, III</label>
            <text syncTime="50.355" offset="340334">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I represent the petitioner, Elwood Barclay, who is here on a writ of certiorari to review a judgment of the Supreme Court of Florida which on direct appeal affirmed his murder conviction and a death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.692" offset="405744">The death sentence was imposed by a judge of the Circuit Court of Duval County who entered written sentencing findings that are the focus of our argument here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.047" offset="447122">The judge disregarded an advisory jury verdict which recommended that Barclay be given life imprisonment, and the Florida Supreme Court affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.653" offset="485575">Barclay lost by a four-to-two vote, and his rehearing petition was denied by an equally divided court.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.807" offset="514205">Petitioner brought the case here on certiorari, and the state filed a brief agreeing that this Court should review the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.600" offset="549313">Now, let me begin my statement of the case before I describe the proceedings in the court below by briefly recounting five points about the Florida death sentencing statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.297" offset="608141">It is a statute that has been in this Court before.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.233" offset="619844">It was the statute approved in the Proffit case, and it was presented as having five procedural safeguards.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.261" offset="651922">First, a requirement that the death sentence be based on specific written findings about aggravating circumstances, which was supposed to serve as a guide for the sentencer's discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.522" offset="701033">Second, the statute says that the list of aggravating circumstances is limited to eight factors, which are listed in the statute, and six of those I will just refer to in a moment are involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.390" offset="760487">Second, the statute provided for an automatic appeal, a review in which the Florida Supreme Court is supposed to keep the sentencing decisions under the statute in line with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.885" offset="814509">Next, the jury had a special role.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.353" offset="828301">Although it is called advisory, the jury... the jury's judgment is supposed to prevail under the Florida law unless no reasonable mind could disagree that the death sentence should be imposed, so that it is... and finally, the idea that both the judge and jury will make a judgment both about the sufficiency of the aggravating circumstances to justify a death sentence as well as a weighing of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.228" offset="971870">So, in summary, in the Proffit case, the Court said that after a verdict of guilt, there would be what this Court referred to as an informed, focused, guided, and objective inquiry into the question of whether a death sentence should be imposed, and that would be at... that kind of objective inquiry, at both the trial and appellate levels.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.206" offset="1055775">Now, in Barclay's case, Barclay was found guilty in March of 1975, along with a co-defendant Dougan.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.075" offset="1099243">He was found guilty of first-degree murder in the death of one Stephen Orlando, and two other co-defendants were convicted by the same jury of second-degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.837" offset="1138322">After the conviction, at the penalty trial, the jury recommended a death sentence for the co-defendant Dougan, but life imprisonment for Barclay.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.411" offset="1192553">And in the penalty hearing, the state argued for only one of the eight statutory aggravating circumstances, that the crime was heinous atrocious, and cruel, yet the state made no effort at that penalty trial to convince the jury that any of the other seven circumstances applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.276" offset="1276040">And the majority of the jury came back with a written finding, a written finding that sufficient aggravating circumstances did not exist to justify a death sentence, and a written finding that sufficient mitigating circumstances do exist which outweigh any aggravating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.644" offset="1353467">The judge discharged the jury and directed a pre-sentence investigation report, and a month later entered his own written findings, and five years later, in 1980, the judge substantially repeated the findings when he reimposed the sentence after it was first vacated on the basis of Gardner against Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.898" offset="1454509">And the judge found seven aggravating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.663" offset="1473630">Now, let me review some of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.803" offset="1486169">The first one is quoted in our brief at Pages 29 and 30, and in this one... this is at the bottom of Page 29 and the bottom of Page 30.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.622" offset="1549385">In this one the judge found as an aggravating circumstance that Barclay had some prior arrests, and he had a prior conviction for forgery and for breaking and entering.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.118" offset="1595361">Now, it is acknowledged by the state that this was an error, and the reason is that what the judge found here was the absence of one of the statutory mitigating circumstances, and it is acknowledged as a matter of state law, it is acknowledged at Page 26, I think, of the state's brief, that under the state's Mikenas case, which the state cites, that it is not correct to make the absence of mitigating circumstances an aggravating circumstance, so that that was a finding that is a non-statutory finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.710" offset="1777800">It is a finding of an aggravating circumstance that is not listed in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.942" offset="1798698">There are two more points about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.176" offset="1815625">One is that mere arrests under... and again, I am referring to Florida law really as a predicate for the federal arguments that I'll make later, but I am merely trying to be descriptive.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.796" offset="1862123">Under the Florida law, the mere arrests don't qualify as convictions, even if there is a relevant crime involved, a violent crime under one of the other subsections, and convictions can't be proved by the presentence investigation report.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.569" offset="1925235">They have to be proved by the state beyond a reasonable doubt at the penalty trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.145" offset="1951462">Now, turning to the next two aggravating circumstances found by the court, and these appear in our brief at the bottom of Page 33 is one, and the next one is over at Page 36, both of these are equally flawed.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.273" offset="2068073">The first one has to do with whether or not the defendant was under a sentence of imprisonment at the time of the murder, and it is undisputed that Barclay at the time of the murder, Barclay was not in prison, he was not supposed to be in prison, he was not on parole, he was not on probation, none of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.798" offset="2138081">The judge found that he was not imprisoned at the top of Page 34, but he said the criminal record was an aggravating circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.186" offset="2171726">So what the judge did here again was to take a past criminal record and say that it was something like, it resembled the statutory aggravating circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.806" offset="2214149">The judge did something similar with the next one, at Page 36.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.286" offset="2244033">He said that... This provision is whether or not the defendant had been convicted of a felony involving the use or threat of violence to the person, and there was nothing like that in Barclay's record, but the judge said that, well, he had been convicted of breaking and entering, and the judge said, it is not known if that prior felony involved the use or threat of violence, but he said, however, such crime can and often does involve violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.914" offset="2374541">So, again, he found something really not in terms of the statute, but he said, well, it is something like the statute, so that we have three findings by the Court which really aren't in terms of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.845" offset="2438280">The judge said, well, I am finding something that resembles the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.376" offset="2452386">Now, the fourth one is whether or not there is... the murder created a great risk of death to many persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.121" offset="2503377">And this one is discussed in our brief beginning over at Page 40, and the judge found that... the judges words,</text>
            <text syncTime="601.491" offset="2544860">"Before, during, and after the murder. "</text>
            <text syncTime="603.427" offset="2552592">the judge said,</text>
            <text syncTime="604.255" offset="2555935">"there was a great risk of death to many persons. "</text>
            <text syncTime="607.020" offset="2567011">He based it on... he's got a before and an after, but he doesn't have a during in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.861" offset="2602329">Before, he said, the defendants drove around looking for a victim, and it is undisputed that the victim was killed in a deserted, lonely road, and that there was no one else around, but the judge found that there was a great risk of death to many persons based on the fact that before finding a victim in a lonely, deserted spot, they looked at and decided not to attack people in groups in other parts of the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.724" offset="2709849">It is a line of reasoning that--</text>

            <text syncTime="654.033" offset="2755093">There is no basis in that line of reasoning for distinguishing any case from among many cases where a--</text>

            <text syncTime="670.822" offset="2822175">In the case of a premeditated murder, you could say that, you know, there was malice aforethought, et cetera, but the murderer was presumably looking only for one victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.459" offset="2860732">He wasn't just going randomly.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.754" offset="2869927">But here one gets the impression from the judge's findings that these people were looking not for one victim, but for almost anybody they came across that met a certain description.</text>

            <text syncTime="698.983" offset="2934815">I mean, the purpose of the statute is to protect large groups of people against death.</text>

            <text syncTime="791.853" offset="3306381">It is an argument based on the Godfrey case at bottom, but the... well, let's look at the other half of it the judge relied on.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.319" offset="3340236">The judge relied on something that happened three days after the murder, which is the mailing of tapes, tape recordings to the news media, and said, this event endangered a half-million people of Jacksonville.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.998" offset="3414946">The problem with that is the same one.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.168" offset="3431560">There is nothing in the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.356" offset="3436366">The state never tried to prove that there were any circumstances that made this dangerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.463" offset="3452771">This wasn't the state's theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.213" offset="3459772">And so there is no evidence to support a notion that anyone was in fact endangered.</text>

            <text syncTime="889.250" offset="3695919">One is that two people even wouldn't be enough to create many people, to equal many people under the Florida law, and it is set forth in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.388" offset="3732491">So, our argument really is that this is a surprise overbroad construction of the law based on... as the law has been interpreted in those Florida cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.102" offset="3779302">Now, we have two principal arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.163" offset="3799573">Our first argument is that the trial court sentencing findings violated Barclay's rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, and the argument is, as I said before, based not merely on the notion that state law wasn't followed, but based on the idea that a combination of non-statutory aggravating circumstances and the factually base is so overbroad construction of the Florida statute created the violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.900" offset="3926528">The second argument, which I will make later, is really in the nature of a rebuttal argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.227" offset="3943873">It is our answer to the state's contention that even if we are correct about the first argument, there need not be a reversal, that the error is in some way harmless or it does not... at least it does not call for reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.784" offset="3998104">The main theme of the Eighth Amendment cases from Furman down to date has been that consistency in the avoidance of arbitrariness is the indispensable element to the constitutionality of capital sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.414" offset="4092562">We think that the use of aggravating circumstances not provided in the statute violates the Eighth Amendment because it makes capital sentencing ungrounded and arbitrary, and to establish that, we point to the three main purposes that statutory aggravating circumstances are supposed to serve.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.375" offset="4184409">The list of statutory circumstances is supposed to enable the legislature to decide what kinds of cases deserve the death penalty, so that there is a legislative judgment represented by the limited list of statutory aggravating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.537" offset="4273121">And if you take an example from our case of the prior criminal record, the first one the judge used, the legislature of Florida didn't decide that if someone had a prior record for a prior arrest and a prior record for forgery, that that was the kind of aggravating circumstance that justified the death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.277" offset="4367998">The second purpose, the second function of the statutory aggravating circumstances is to guide the sentencer's exercise of discretion, to channel the discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.146" offset="4423482">And the third function was to provide a basis for appellate review, so that the appellate court would have a way of looking at the findings and attempting to ensure that similar results would be reached in similar cases, and it is our position that all three of these purposes of statutory aggravating circumstances are defeated if the judge is allowed, as the judge in this case did, to make up the aggravating circumstances as he goes along.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.462" offset="4552735">A factor that one judge will think aggravating will be evaluated differently by another, and a judge presumably will change his view as time passes, so that the danger of arbitrary decision-making is reintroduced into the process.</text>

            <text syncTime="1221.945" offset="5026701">I think there is nothing in the Florida decisions that uses the threshold language or the language in the recent opinion of the Georgia Supreme Court after the remand in the Zandt case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.453" offset="5104755">On the question of the Eighth Amendment, in summary, I guess, our position is that the safeguards that aggravating circumstances were supposed to serve under the statute fell through in this case, that the trial court really didn't live up to what was represented in Proffit, to assure that after Barclay's conviction there really would be an informed, focused, guided, and objective inquiry into the question of whether or not he would be sentenced to death, and I think that none of those adjectives really fairly describe the findings on which Barclay was sentenced to death, and we submit that the sentence violates the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.620" offset="5289389">Now, turning to the second point, which as I said before is a rebuttal argument, what we are doing in Part 2 of our brief is answering the Attorney General's contention that Florida's rule, which is embodied in its Elledge case, and which we will call the Elledge rule, makes it appropriate for the court below to affirm even if there were constitutional errors, even if there was a violation of the Eighth Amendment, or several violations of the Eighth Amendment of the kind that we complain about in our first argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.765" offset="5418015">Let me describe the Elledge rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.249" offset="5427942">The Elledge case provides really, as we see it, two rules for dealing with a case where the trial court has made an error, either an error by considering a non-statutory aggravating circumstance or by misapplying one of the statutory circumstances, but where there are other valid aggravating factors remaining in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.270" offset="5519998">Now, the Elledge case says that a reversal is required, that that situation calls for a reversal if there are statutory mitigating findings, because the reviewing court can't tell whether the error distorted the weighing process, so that... so, to be clear, under Florida law, it is error to consider a non-statutory aggravating circumstance, and they call it error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.928" offset="5650610">They call it error even in those cases where they don't reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.474" offset="5660850">And the cases where they don't reverse are under the second half of the Elledge rule, and that is that the death sentence will be affirmed if there are no statutory mitigating circumstances, no statutory mitigating circumstances, and that is the... the state law premise of Elledge is in the language which is quoted at the top of Page 87 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.164" offset="5787596">The idea is that so long as there are some statutory aggravating circumstances, there is no danger that non-statutory circumstances have served to overcome the mitigating circumstances in the weighing process, in other words, that there is nothing to balance against whatever aggravating circumstances remain, and therefore it is called... what happens is what the Attorney General refers to in quoting the Ford case as a presumption of death, that... The state quotes the same language we do from Ford saying, there being no mitigating factors present, death is presumed to be the appropriate penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.863" offset="5974424">Now, our argument is that that rule itself violates the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.565" offset="6005144">It is a rule of appellate review, a procedural rule about when you do and when you don't reverse in the presence of a constitutional error, but that this Elledge rule violates the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.154" offset="6047566">Assuming that Elledge is a presumption, a rule of law, it violates Lockett.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.182" offset="6079645">It directly violates the holding of the Lockett case, because the Ohio statute in Lockett, remember, was one where if there were statutory aggravating circumstances found, and there was no statutory mitigating circumstance, then the death sentence was mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.751" offset="6169924">That was what that statute did, and the Elledge case is identical in the way it ignores the non-statutory mitigating factors, and the Ford case, which I mentioned before, the Ford case in the Florida Supreme Court, makes it plain that that is the way the Elledge rule operates, because it shows that the Elledge rule operates even if there are non-statutory mitigating circumstances in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.660" offset="6293535">There is a presumption of death, so that the presumption overrides non-statutory mitigating circumstances just like the Ohio statute in the Lockett case did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.780" offset="6342019">The second... we really have four objections to the Elledge rule, and the first one I have just mentioned, which is based on Lockett.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.151" offset="6383501">The second one is that the penalty is automatic without regard to the sufficiency of the aggravating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.193" offset="6431671">It is just a mechanical rule, and that that violates Woodson and Lockett, which require there be a judgment about the appropriateness of the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.315" offset="6468242">The final two points I will touch on quickly, and they are familiar to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.564" offset="6485170">Assuming that Elledge is not really strictly a mechanical rule, and does involve some judgment or some guess as to what the trial court would have done in the circumstances, then we have the Stromberg principle, which is the same argument that is before the Court in the example of Stevens, and we also have a general Eighth Amendment argument that that kind of review doesn't meet the special Eighth Amendment requirements of reliability which are required because of the special harshness of the death penalty.</text>

            <text syncTime="1699.784" offset="6938029">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, the state of Florida has never claimed that defendants in her courts receive a perfect trial, but only a fair one, and as of this date, approximately 1:35 p.m., that is all the Constitution requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.553" offset="7053176">I think because of the multiplicity of challenges hurled at cases availing the death penalty, it would seem that the only time a capital defendant receives a fair trial is when he is acquitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.733" offset="7129872">I think the overriding issue before this Court is whether the imposition of the death penalty in the instant case contravenes any of the protections afforded by the petitioner or to him under the Constitution, not only the federal but the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.176" offset="7227674">A good starting place is the standard of review followed by the Florida Supreme Court in its review of death penalty cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.781" offset="7274068">That court assumes, and logically so, that where there are multiple statutory aggravating factors and there are no mitigating factors at all, then the weighing process would have reached the same outcome by the trial judge even had he not considered what is termed an improper aggravating factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.800" offset="7402172">Now, this principle is well illustrated in several cases, and I will mention only two of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.187" offset="7439684">One is Dobbert v. State, where the Florida Supreme Court held that the trial judge improperly found two aggravating factors, but since there were no mitigating factors at all, a reversal of the death sentence was not required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.709" offset="7541771">And in Ford v. State, cited on Page 15 of my brief, the same result was reached by the Florida Supreme Court, and what is interesting about both of those cases is that this Court declined to review either one of them on certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.073" offset="7643230">I have no hesitancy to urge to this Court that petitioner's death penalty was properly imposed based on proof beyond a reasonable doubt of what I count as five statutory aggravating factors, and no mitigating factors at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.266" offset="7748033">In thinking about this, I want it to be understood that in finding this non-statutory aggravating factor that is now complained of to the Court, the trial judge did not consider any evidence that he would not have otherwise known.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.882" offset="7830476">Rather, it was necessary for the trial judge to consider petitioner's prior criminal record because unless the existence of this mitigating factor is negated, then there will be a presumption that petitioner had not engaged in any previous course of crime at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.855" offset="7934339">This is again well illustrated in the Florida Supreme Court case of Booker v. State, where that court rejected, now, an argument that the trial judge had considered a non-statutory aggravating factor because on cross examination the defendant was interrogated as to his prior criminal activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.641" offset="8049486">Now, the Florida Supreme Court pointedly stated that those questions were posed to the defendant in order to negate or show the absence of a mitigating circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.574" offset="8109255">That is, that the defendant had no significant history of prior criminal actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.320" offset="8140184">Now, this was necessary, as the court pointed out, and I quote the words of the court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.191" offset="8175710">"Unless this mitigating factor is negated, there would be a presumption that the defendant had not engaged in any previous criminal activity. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.217" offset="8231821">Therefore, I say to you that in finding a non-statutory aggravating factor, the trial judge not only did not review any evidence that he was not entitled to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.695" offset="8289709">Rather, he was required to review that evidence in order to determine the existence of a... or the non-existence of a mitigating factor.</text>

            <text syncTime="2122.318" offset="8628151">Now, I submit to you that unless this Court does a legal about-face and Proffit v. Florida, that that case should control the instant case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.983" offset="8686874">The Proffit opinion at 428 US Page 246 sets forth the aggravating factors found by the trial judge.</text>

            <text syncTime="2159.802" offset="8778094">Now, I find this interesting, because this aggravating factor of propensity to commit murder was not then and never has been a statutorily enumerated aggravating factor under Florida law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.981" offset="8862835">I think, frankly, there is no getting around the point that this Court approved the use of a non-statutory aggravating factor when used, now, along with other statutory aggravating factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.830" offset="8950293">The decision in Elledge v. State supports the respondent's argument here, because the Elledge court in construing Proffit read something in there, I believe, that is not there, but rather than to go into that, let's take Elledge the way it stands, and Elledge simply holds that a non-statutory aggravating factor will not vitiate a death penalty where there are other statutorily enumerated factors and there are no mitigating factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.890" offset="9138479">That is the holding in Elledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.545" offset="9145062">I would like to tell you how they came to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.872" offset="9162407">From the record in Elledge, there was a non-statutory enumerated aggravating factor, and of course there was a statutory aggravating factor, and the trial judge had alluded to something that could have been construed as being a mitigating factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.065" offset="9263240">Well, now, what the Florida Supreme Court wanted to do, and what they did do, was to be sure that a non-statutory aggravating factor would not be used to offset a mitigating factor in the weighing process, but we don't have that problem here, because there were no mitigating factors at all unless you do as my honorable opponent would urge you to do, and that is substitute your judgment and reweigh all of the aggravating factors that were weighed by the trial judge and approved by the Florida Supreme Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2475.970" offset="10042838">He is the one that does the weighing under Florida law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.923" offset="10058616">The Florida Supreme Court simply on review looks at the evidence and determines if it is competent to support the aggravating factors that the trial judge has found.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.883" offset="10118489">They do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.915" offset="10122564">In fact, the duty is well stated in Songer v. State, which this Court referred to in Proffit v. Florida, and I quote:</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.582" offset="10173242">"Where the death penalty has been imposed, this Court has a separate responsibility to determine independently whether the imposition of the ultimate penalty is warranted. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.280" offset="10228099">And that is what they do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.858" offset="10234368">They don't reweigh in the sense, if you please, to determine if the death penalty is or should be initially imposed, but what they do on review is to determine if it has been lawfully imposed, if there is competent evidence cited by the trial judge in support of his findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.661" offset="10329558">I think, too, that the Florida Supreme Court standard of review in death penalty cases can be reviewed actually for what it is, and that is the application of the harmless error rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.762" offset="10401970">Now, there is nothing new in this, because more than 30 years ago in North v. State, decided in 1952, the Florida Supreme Court expressly held that the harmless error rule was applicable in capital cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.411" offset="10464559">And not only that, in the two Ferguson cases, which I cite in my brief, the application of the harmless error rule is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.406" offset="10524536">For example, in Ferguson, 417 Southern 2nd 631, the Court held that, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.622" offset="10557451">"Any error that occurred in the consideration of the inapplicable aggravating circumstances was harmless. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.493" offset="10600918">And again, in Ferguson 417 639, the Court held that any error that occurred in the consideration of the two inapplicable aggravating factors was harmless, based on the weighing process that the judge followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.453" offset="10684719">And interestingly, in the recent case of Ford v. Strickland, Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals en banc opinion filed January 7th, 1983, Chief Judge Godbold, in a dissenting opinion in part and specially concurring in part, stated that he interpreted the Florida Supreme Court to apply a harmless error rule in refusing to order resentencing, and that the Florida Supreme Court's actions so interpreted passed constitutional muster.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.530" offset="10853052">This Court, several Justices, I think, have opted for the application of the harmless error rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.386" offset="10900491">In Zant v. Stevens, Justice Powell, in a dissenting opinion, stated he would leave it open to the Georgia Supreme Court to decide whether it had authority to find that the instruction complained of was harmless error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.034" offset="10967051">In Drake v. Zant, Justice White dissents, dissenting to a denial of cert, stated that as a matter of general constitutional policy, he thought it essential that appellate courts be able to employ a harmless error rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.840" offset="11042283">In fact, this Court has employed the harmless error rule in several cases, Schnevel v. State, Meritan v. Wainwright, Harrington v. California, and in the well-known Chapman case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.630" offset="11109470">Now, then, looking at Petitioner's brief, the tenor of it is, of course, that the trial judge committed egregious error in failing to find any mitigating factor at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.232" offset="11175821">Well, really, this is understandable when viewed from where he sits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.042" offset="11199122">However, this claim has been made and rejected by the Florida Supreme Court in many cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.181" offset="11231619">They are cited in my brief, Lucas v. State, Sireci v. State, Mikenas v. State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.628" offset="11269444">And in that case... it's a good case on point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.423" offset="11292641">It says... The court there... Let me phrase this properly... rejected the argument that certain testimony should have been treated as mitigating factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.605" offset="11353349">There was psychiatric testimony at trial, and it was argued that the trial judge erred in refusing to regard that as mitigating.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.177" offset="11411655">Well, the Florida Supreme Court pointed out that the testimony was apparently permitted by the trial judge in an abundance of fairness to the defendant, but that the court was not required to give it weight as a mitigating circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.932" offset="11502665">Now, that is... they leave the weighing, initial weighing to the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.072" offset="11527220">This premise, I think, is supported... I don't think; it is... well supported by this Court's decision in Eddings v. Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.756" offset="11573927">There, this Court reviewed the Oklahoma death penalty statute which permitted a defendant to present evidence as to any mitigating factor that he so desired, and then stated that Lockett v. Ohio requires the sentencer to listen, but as to the weight to be given to the mitigating evidence, I quote the words of the court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.025" offset="11699002">"We do not weigh the evidence for them. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.554" offset="11717183">And in this connection, it must be pointed out that Lockett held that while the sentencing authority must not be precluded from reviewing anything offered as mitigating, it did not undertake to dictate the weight that the various factors are to be given by the trial court, and that actually Lockett v. Ohio does not claim, does not hold, and does not indicate that this Court would substitute this judgment for that of state courts in capital cases at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="3415.489" offset="13800918">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.816" offset="13810218">May it please the Court, in the few moments I have left, I would like to talk about how I see the harmless error concept coming into this case, and also say something about the Lewis case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.983" offset="13858910">I think a factual point to be made about how Lewis fits in here is that there were facts upon which the jury might reasonably have found that there were both statutory and non-statutory mitigating circumstances for Barclay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.788" offset="13934038">The argument of counsel was based on the record that he was a follower, he was not the leader of the group of people who were convicted of the murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.049" offset="13983149">His family status, that he had a wife and five children, that he had a job, that he was a young man, only 23 years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.641" offset="14013451">And a major factor that was emphasized to the jury was the disparity of sentencing, the disparity of punishment between Barclay and the other two people who got second-degree murder but who the jury knew had committed two murders, that were sentenced to terms of imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.149" offset="14087534">The jury also might very well have based its finding on either of four of the statutory mitigating factors, the age, the fact that the state did not prove the prior record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.799" offset="14146153">They might have found lesser participation, and they may have found domination by Dougan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.500" offset="14168931">Now, it seems to me that the state's distinction of Lewis is not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.028" offset="14191083">Lewis is an application of the Elledge rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.464" offset="14200801">It is an appellate level rule and not a trial level rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.900" offset="14218564">The Lewis case was sent back for resentencing, the same judge, and the same counsel representing the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.507" offset="14248971">Mr. Allbritton argued it, and Judge Olaff decided Lewis, and he made the same kinds of errors he did here, and the Court of Appeals reversed Lewis because three of these same kinds of aggravating circumstances were reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.938" offset="14310724">And the ground for a remand in Lewis was merely that there was a jury, the remaining aggravating circumstance had to be weighed against a jury's life recommendation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.604" offset="14365372">Now, turning to the harmless error point, this is not really a harmless error case in the ordinary sense, in the Chapman sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.007" offset="14402989">There is no submission by the state... there is no inquiry by the state into the question of prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.942" offset="14434649">Certainly the court below didn't rely on harmless error.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.112" offset="14447397">They didn't acknowledge that there was any error at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.940" offset="14454711">So whether you call it the Elledge rule or harmless error, it is really the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.859" offset="14478326">It is harmless error principles attempted to be used in justification for a presumption, a legal rule, the Elledge rule, and our four objections to the Elledge rule, I think, pertain whether you call it harmless error or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.791" offset="14550110">The counsel did not in argument and in his brief disagree with our characterization of Elledge as ignoring, Elledge and Ford, ignoring non-statutory mitigating circumstances, and the only exception to that is Lewis, is the Lewis case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.374" offset="14644464">Lewis is the law, as I said before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.983" offset="14650838">There is no non-arbitrary application of the law that would convict Barclay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.214" offset="14679782">But even examining this case under... if we ever got to trying to apply the Chapman v. California doctrine to this case, considering the special care and reliability required in capital sentencing, the fact that the death sentence was by no means foreordained in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.330" offset="14772255">There is no way that you could say beyond a reasonable doubt that the error, the multiple constitutional errors, we submit, that were the basis of the sentence of Elwood Barclay could be harmless.</text>
