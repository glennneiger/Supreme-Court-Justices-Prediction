            <label>Mr. John F. DePue</label>
            <text syncTime="10.856" offset="188399">This case presents the question whether a federal appellate court may summarily reverse a conviction because of the prosecutor's improper comment on the defendant's failure to present evidence, without first making an assessment for prejudice under the constitutional harmless error standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.233" offset="261960">Briefly summarized, the government's evidence showed that during the early morning of October 11th, 1979, three teenaged girls and a male companion were driving in the vicinity of East St. Louis, Illinois, when their car was forced off the road by five men driving a turquoise Cadillac.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.945" offset="336775">After both cars had come to a halt, the girls were pulled from their car.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.647" offset="359554">One of them was raped.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.099" offset="365405">The men then forced them into the Cadillac, drove them across the interstate boundary into St. Louis, Missouri, where they repeated their sexual assaults at three different locations.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.073" offset="413261">Following the girls' release, one of them led the police to the apartment where she had been taken by her abductors.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.410" offset="442623">There, the officers arrested respondent Stewart and found items of clothing belonging to the victims.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.812" offset="472194">They also located the turquoise Cadillac, learned that it was registered to respondent Williams, and found Williams' latent prints on the car from which the girls had been taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.605" offset="515452">These developments also resulted in the apprehension of the remaining respondents, each of whom was identified by at least one of the victims during a lineup the following morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.913" offset="556621">At their ensuing trial for rape and a Mann Act violation, each of the victims again identified each respondent as a participant in the abductions.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.720" offset="603851">The defense did not put on the defendants themselves as witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.624" offset="627465">Instead, their defense was calculated to discredit the girls, their credibility and the accuracy of their identifications by reference to the girls' activities just before and just after the abductions took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.717" offset="683890">For example, they elicited testimony from the girls during cross examination that they had been out drinking, in violation of parentally-imposed curfews and that they'd gotten lost on the way home from a tavern.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.292" offset="730179">And that just after the abductions, their initial identifications and descriptions of respondents were not very accurate and were confused.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="154.630" offset="763511">Well, that's a fairly standard tactic, isn't it?</text>
            <text syncTime="157.166" offset="773647">How does that bear on the issue here?</text>

            <label>Mr. John F. DePue</label>
            <text syncTime="158.849" offset="780334">It bears, Justice Rehnquist, on the argument that we will see that the prosecutor presented subsequently, because we maintain it was a direct reference to what the defendants were actually doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.224" offset="829862">In addition, respondents presented witnesses of their own who testified that just before and just after the alleged abductions, the physical appearances of respondents were not at all correspondent with those as described by the victims.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.354" offset="902378">The prosecutor in his summation first discussed the posture of the government's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.957" offset="932785">He then turned to respondents' case and he made the following statement, which appears at page 21 of the Joint Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.250" offset="961937">And I'm going to quote it verbatim from the record because of its centrality to these proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.171" offset="981686">He said,</text>
            <text syncTime="209.763" offset="983985">"Let's look at the evidence the defendant put on here for you so that we can put that in perspective. "</text>
            <text syncTime="214.419" offset="1002688">"I'm going to tell you what the defendant did not do. "</text>
            <text syncTime="218.288" offset="1018153">"Defendants on cross examination and-- "</text>
            <text syncTime="222.161" offset="1033617">When respondents objected on the ground that they didn't have to testify at all, the prosecutor continued,</text>
            <text syncTime="227.016" offset="1053052">"That's right, they don't. "</text>
            <text syncTime="228.002" offset="1057023">"They don't have to. "</text>
            <text syncTime="229.094" offset="1061412">"But if they do put on a case, the government can comment on it. "</text>
            <text syncTime="232.130" offset="1073532">"The defendants at no time ever challenged any of the rapes, whether or not that occurred, any of the sodomies. "</text>
            <text syncTime="238.368" offset="1098505">"They didn't challenge the kidnapping, the fact that the girls were in East St. Louis and were taken across to St. Louis. "</text>
            <text syncTime="244.688" offset="1123687">"They never challenged the transportation of the victims from East St. Louis, Illinois to St. Louis, Missouri, and they never challenged the location or whereabouts of the defendants at all relevant times. "</text>
            <text syncTime="255.330" offset="1166319">"They want you to focus your attention on all the events that were before all of the crucial events of that evening. "</text>
            <text syncTime="261.750" offset="1192024">"They want to pull your focus away from the beginning of the incident in East St. Louis after they were bumped, and then the proceeding events. "</text>
            <text syncTime="269.340" offset="1222326">"They want to focus to the events prior to that. "</text>
            <text syncTime="273.724" offset="1239880">Following this, the defense moved for a mistrial on Fifth Amendment grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.545" offset="1267152">The trial judge denied the motion, commenting that to his view, this was simply a commentary of the posture of the cases and didn't implicate Fifth Amendment issues at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.686" offset="1307694">The Seventh Circuit, however, disagreed, characterizing the remarks as a pointed allusion to respondents' failure to take the stand, and held that they constituted a clear violation of this Court's decision in Griffin versus California.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.661" offset="1363596">Although the court acknowledged that the crimes were heinous and that the evidence of guilt was clear, it refused to assess for prejudice under the constitutional harmless error standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.153" offset="1413647">Instead, after alluding to the fact that prosecutors in the Seventh Circuit had continuously disregarded admonitions not to make arguments that implicated Fifth Amendment rights, they stated that to their view, application of the constitutional harmless error standard would impermissibly compromise the defendants' Fifth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.436" offset="1514688">It's the government's position that this reasoning is in direct violation of this Court's decision in Chapman versus California, violates the federal harmless error statute and contravenes broader rules regarding the formulation of remedies in criminal cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="436.279" offset="1890120">Oh, certainly, Chief Justice Burger.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.306" offset="1902241">And as a matter of fact, they presented witnesses of their own who said that they saw these people shortly after midnight and approximately at 6:00 o'clock in the morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.502" offset="1934946">And in addition to this, one of respondents' mothers, respondent Stevens' mother actually saw Stevens and the girls and testified that to her observation, everything that was going on was consensual.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.976" offset="1988863">So in fact, these were challenged to a certain extent, and there were people who could have testified to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.546" offset="2011119">Now, of course, in Chapman versus California, a state prosecutor, relying on a provision of the state constitution, directly and repeatedly commented on the defendant's failure to testify and the inferences of guilt that could be extracted from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.544" offset="2091158">The trial judge followed suit in his instructions to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.579" offset="2111325">Following that trial, however, this Court in Griffin versus California held that the provision of the California Constitution upon which he had relied was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.886" offset="2160540">When Chapman's own case came before this Court, Chapman held, argued that all errors of a constitutional magnitude, and Griffin errors in particular, should be deemed reversal per se, and thus not subject to review under the harmless error standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.896" offset="2220517">This Court, however, squarely rejected that proposition.</text>

            <label>Mr. John F. DePue</label>
            <text syncTime="541.576" offset="2311318">Now, when the case came before this Court, the Court rejected that argument, and held that Griffin violations, just like any other non-constitutional violations, could be deemed harmless and thus not a basis for reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.835" offset="2372340">It reversed Chapman's conviction, but only after first satisfying itself that given the less than overwhelming posture of the evidence, it could not be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the prosecutor's pointed and repeated allusions to the defendant's failure to testify was not harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.698" offset="2455828">In the wake of Chapman, and prior to the decision of the court below, this Court and the courts of appeals have virtually without exception held that the constitutional harmless error standard applies to violations of Griffin.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.592" offset="2511312">They have therefore reversed convictions only when after canvassing the evidence in its totality, looking at the argument in its proper context, they couldn't be satisfied that it didn't contribute to the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.816" offset="2564288">This approach, we maintain, is not only mandated by the Chapman decision itself, but by broader principles of revenue recently articulated by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.505" offset="2603054">In United States versus Morrison, the Third Circuit dismissed an indictment because a government agent had made improper remarks to the defense counsel about the competency of her own lawyer, to the defendant about the competency of her own lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.169" offset="2685705">This Court, however, reversed, finding that dismissal was unwarranted absent any evidence that the alleged Sixth Amendment violation could have prejudiced the defendant and the proceedings in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.594" offset="2755400">In doing so, the Court admonished the courts of appeals that after identifying a constitutional error, the proper approach was to assess the damage, and to tailor a remedy that was commensurate to the injury received as a result of that violation, and then a broader approach would impermissibly infringe upon other legitimate interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.126" offset="2853516">In the context of a Chapman violation... of a Griffin violation, this means that once the court has determined that the violation occurred, it has got to look at the amount of prejudice that resulted in determining whether other events at trial offset it.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.920" offset="2924674">It cannot summarily reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.837" offset="2936376">Of course, harmless error principles are not simply a matter of judicial self-restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.776" offset="2960096">The federal harmless error statute and Rule 52(a) of the federal rules of criminal procedure both expressly prohibit a court of appeals from reversing a conviction on the basis of errors or defects that do not substantially affect the nature of the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.670" offset="3039612">Respondent argues, however, that the harmless error statute and Rule 52(a) are inapplicable to this case because the error involved is of a constitutional magnitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.347" offset="3098336">This Court has, however, squarely rejected this reasoning in Chapman itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.068" offset="3117248">There, the Court accepted the policy embodied by the federal harmless error statute which was to require an assessment of prejudice in all cases without regard to whether the error was of a constitutional or non-constitutional magnitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.780" offset="3188092">Respondent's principal contention, however, is that the Court in the exercise of its supervisory power was free to disregard the Chapman standard and fashion a remedy of its own as a prophylactic measure because of the alleged repeated violations of the Griffin standard within the circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.495" offset="3282969">In the first place, nothing in the decision of that court even suggests that it was in fact relying on its supervisory power.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.417" offset="3322675">The court's language that it felt the application of a harmless error standard would impermissibly compromise the defendant's Fifth Amendment rights suggests that it simply didn't believe that the harmless error standard was sufficient, a sufficient mechanism to protect the defendants against Fifth Amendment violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.628" offset="3403446">But be that as it may, there are three reasons why the Seventh Circuit could not adopt a reversal per se rule in the exercise of its supervisory power.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.304" offset="3462169">In the first place, as Justice Frankfurter stated in Sherman versus United States long ago, the supervisory power entails the formulation of standards for the administration of criminal justice when Congress has not specifically legislated to that end.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.484" offset="3542940">Where, however, Congress in the exercise of its constitutional power to regulate the courts has expressly articulated a standard that is applicable to the issue, here, the federal harmless error statute and Rule 52(a) of the federal rules of criminal procedure, the courts of appeals are not free to disregard that standard and fashion a remedy of their own in the exercise of their supervisory power.</text>

            <text syncTime="1296.265" offset="5330029">It is not surprising, given the highly subjective nature of this assessment, that appellate courts will frequently reach different conclusions on very similar factual situations and arguments.</text>

            <text syncTime="1339.925" offset="5504736">Indeed, while it is true that the prosecutor did use the word "defendant", no objective person could have viewed his argument as a commentary upon the defendant's personal failure to testify.</text>

            <text syncTime="1659.398" offset="6782541">Like Chapman, it involves comments on the failure to testify, and like Chapman, for purposes of review, the error was conceded, but there are significant differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.837" offset="6824337">In Chapman, at the time the comment was made, the courts had not yet found that that type of comment, at least in the state court setting, was constitutional error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.443" offset="6862789">However, in this case, long before the comment had been made, the courts of appeals had found that this type of comment was in fact constitutional error.</text>

            <text syncTime="1719.687" offset="7023704">Chapman involved the question, of course, of whether a Fifth Amendment comment could ever be harmless error, and the Court said it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.758" offset="7048050">This case questions... this case questions the power of the federal courts of appeals, whether they have the power to refrain from applying Chapman in an appropriate case in order to deter misconduct which stands in violation of repeated decisions by the courts of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.875" offset="7120461">I think it is very important to recognize that last point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.373" offset="7134463">The federal court of appeals in the Seventh Circuit has repeatedly dealt with this problem, the exact problem, indirect comments that a defendant didn't contradict or deny or refute evidence, and it has repeatedly held the same thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1834.709" offset="7483772">It was repealed because of the enactment of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="2008.986" offset="8180928">So, we contend that there is still... there is still... the statute is inapplicable, and furthermore, nothing in the legislative history, in fact, nothing in Chapman itself would seem to indicate that the harmless error rule itself was meant to take away the supervisory powers of the court to deter repeated misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.351" offset="8278417">That is a point I think that has to be brought out in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2802.089" offset="11353343">In fact, in Bruno, the statute involved was the present day 304.81, commenting on the failure to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.988" offset="11388974">It seems to me it very logically follows that if it doesn't apply to the statutes it wasn't meant to apply to the constitutional violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.347" offset="11418336">Even assuming, Your Honor, assuming arguendo that the statute could be applied, may be applicable, we contend that the harmless error statute was not intended to deprive the court of their traditional supervisory powers, powers that are recognized in McNabb, powers that are recognized in Donnelly versus DeChristoforo, for instance, to deter prosecutorial misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.651" offset="11507570">Those powers, we believe, are still there, and absent something much clearer that would indicate that the Congress meant to take away that power, that supervisory power is there.</text>

            <text syncTime="3104.964" offset="12564798">To support this proposition, in both the decision in this case and the preceding Rodriguez decision, they cited a total of eight cases, I believe, that occurred over some 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.188" offset="12609728">In only one of these cases was there an actual comment on the defendant's failure to testify which the Seventh Circuit found was inadvertent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.758" offset="12644001">In two of the cases, they found that there was no violation of Griffin.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.912" offset="12660615">In the remaining cases, they found that remarks like "undisputed" or "uncontested" transgressed this indistinct line that I have discussed previously, and therefore constituted what I would term technical violations of Griffin.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.006" offset="12721010">You simply cannot use a supervisory power as a prophylaxis, assuming it was otherwise amenable, as a prophylaxis for prohibiting unintended misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.809" offset="12780256">This was the essence of Judge Larson's dissent in Rodriguez.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.138" offset="12797496">Inadvertent remarks aren't subject to a didactic lesson.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.621" offset="12811498">In response to Justice Stevens' question concerning whether the phrase "substantial rights" would preclude application of the Constitutional harmless error standard in this case, or in any other case involving Constitutional errors, no, the substantial relates not to the nature of the right but to the nature of the injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.385" offset="12898538">If substantial right were construed to implicate the nature of the right involved, no Constitutional error could ever be deemed harmless, because they are all substantial.</text>

            <text syncTime="3203.077" offset="12957261">It would mean no Constitutional error would be covered by the harmless error statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.574" offset="12975234">It could still be deemed harmless under Chapman against California under the reasoning of that opinion, which did not rely on the harmless error statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3215.518" offset="13007103">No, it didn't rely on the harmless error statute, but it certainly said, let the statute and the principles embodied in that statute apply to errors of a Constitutional magnitude, which are invariably substantial rights.</text>
