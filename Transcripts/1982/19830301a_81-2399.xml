            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="138182">We will hear arguments first this morning in Metropolitan Edison against People Against Nuclear Energy.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.089" offset="186456">Mr. Bator, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_m_bator" startTime="17.132" stopTime="167.367">
            <label>Mr. Paul M. Bator</label>
            <text syncTime="17.132" offset="206623">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case involves Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear power reactor, TMI 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.657" offset="252807">TMI 1 is one of two units at Three Mile Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.672" offset="272869">It was in the other unit, TMI 2, that the Three Mile Island accident occurred in March of 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.309" offset="307351">When that accident occurred, TMI 1 happened to be shut down for routine refueling, and it has been shut down ever since, and this case involves its restart.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.615" offset="360641">The question before the Court is whether the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, before it may begin... before it may permit TMI 1 to restart, is required by the National Environmental Policy Act, NEPA, is required to make an inquiry in order to predict whether and to what extent psychological stress will occur on restart because of the fear and anxiety of neighboring residents that there may be a second accident at Three Mile Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.555" offset="500344">The government's central contention is that NEPA does not require administrative agencies to conduct an inquiry for the purpose of predicting fears that their proposed actions may engender.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.269" offset="563246">The central purpose of NEPA is to require the government to take a hard look at the impact of its proposed actions on the natural environment, and on the direct consequence of those interventions, and we argue that stress caused by fear and anxiety that government action may be harmful to you is not an environmental impact, and is therefore not cognizant.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.490" offset="676095">Now, I may give a humble example to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.299" offset="691351">If the government proposes to put massive amounts of fluoride into the water, of course, the government must make a scrupulous inquiry whether the fluoridation will be harmful or helpful to health.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.435" offset="759896">But our contention is that Congress did not contemplate that a separate and distinct inquiry be made into whether fluoridation will cause popular anxiety.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="167.367" stopTime="184.111">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="167.367" offset="807648">Well, isn't the question here whether the Act of Congress and Congress itself intended that that be a subject of the inquiry, rather than whether in fact anxiety is aroused by these problems?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_m_bator" startTime="184.111" stopTime="234.462">
            <label>Mr. Paul M. Bator</label>
            <text syncTime="184.111" offset="874626">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.063" offset="878388">Our contention is that the statute, properly read, does not require the Commission to make such a subsidiary and distinct inquiry into the question of stress.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.667" offset="928752">On the other hand, the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia in this case held that it is not enough to do what the Commission in this case did, which is to engage in an extensive, an exhaustive inquiry into the question of the safety of restart, taking into account for that inquiry the painful lessons of TMI 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.467" offset="1028017">Rather, the Court ruled that apart from the actual safety issue, stress resulting from fears about safety is an independent factor.</text>

          <turn speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="234.462" stopTime="254.062">
            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="234.462" offset="1075978">Mr. Bator, can I ask you about your hypothetical?</text>
            <text syncTime="237.773" offset="1089248">It seems to me that is different from this case, because there you are assuming an environmental impact, namely, the fluoridation, and psychological impairment of health as a result of an environmental impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.421" offset="1135851">Is that correct?</text>
            <text syncTime="251.391" offset="1143687">Are you saying that wouldn't be something you would look at?</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="255.045" offset="1158316">Then you are arguing that psychological health is not health.</text>

            <text syncTime="259.028" offset="1174198">We readily concede that psychological health is health.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="263.369" stopTime="271.929">
            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="263.369" offset="1191648">And you are saying you don't have to look at it even if it's caused by a change in the environment?</text>
            <text syncTime="269.773" offset="1217248">That's a different argument than your brief makes.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_m_bator" startTime="271.929" stopTime="309.583">
            <label>Mr. Paul M. Bator</label>
            <text syncTime="271.929" offset="1225816">No, our argument, Justice Stevens, is that there are two sorts of health impairments, including mental health impairments, that must be kept distinct.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.157" offset="1286734">If the government intervenes in the environment, and the intervention itself directly causes health effects, including mental health effects, then that consequential impact must be considered in the NEPA process.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="309.583" stopTime="313.693">
            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="309.583" offset="1376491">Well, that is your fluoride case.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.304" offset="1379312">It seems to me that's your fluoride case.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.911" offset="1385790">I think you may have picked a bad hypothetical.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_m_bator" startTime="313.693" stopTime="322.720">
            <label>Mr. Paul M. Bator</label>
            <text syncTime="313.693" offset="1392895">No, our argument, Your Honor, is that the... maybe I... maybe another illustration would help.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="322.720" stopTime="323.219">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="322.720" offset="1429049">I think maybe--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_m_bator" startTime="323.219" stopTime="373.839">
            <label>Mr. Paul M. Bator</label>
            <text syncTime="323.219" offset="1431034">Because the role in which mental health can come in is if there is a direct, almost a traumatic consequence.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.481" offset="1468024">That is, if the government proposes to build an airport, and there would be a tremendous amount of noise which would drive people mad, or if the government licenses an emission of lead that will cause retardation among children, then it seems to us that that kind of mental health effect is like other health effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.019" offset="1558198">The crucial distinction between that and this case and the fluoridation case is the proposition about fear and anxiety.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.186" offset="1598845">We don't think that anxiety produced by the fear of an environmental impact counts as an environmental impact.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="373.839" stopTime="393.067">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="373.839" offset="1633535">--What you are saying, I take it, is that you don't need committees and parades and pickets to draw attention to the vibration and the noise of an airplane going over at 300, 400, 500 feet or 1,000 feet, and that that is quite a different thing.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_m_bator" startTime="393.067" stopTime="612.582">
            <label>Mr. Paul M. Bator</label>
            <text syncTime="393.067" offset="1710440">Yes, we believe it is quite a different thing really for a number of very, we submit, very profound reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.656" offset="1740742">I would like to take it back to the statute, because it seems to me that the key to this case is to ask the question, what was the central concern, what was the central focus of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.621" offset="1784628">This statute instructed the government to pay more attention than it had heretofore done to the impacts that governmental action has on the natural environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.443" offset="1843873">Now, that's not because Congress was in some abstract way worried about the land and the water and the air and plant life and animal life.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.858" offset="1897581">Of course, the ultimate purpose in worrying about those phenomena was to safeguard human health and human welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.996" offset="1930078">But the central finding of NEPA was that insensitivity to the natural environment was dangerous, might produce dangers to man's health and welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.003" offset="1986189">And Congress created a statutory structure that rather insistently says that you must focus your attention on the environmental impact of what it is you do.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.640" offset="2048673">The statutory structure, as it were, puts two hurdles before the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.232" offset="2071034">It says that the impact statement is required only if the proposed action has a significant impact on the human environment, and then, importantly, the statute does not just stop there.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.410" offset="2127772">It doesn't say that all the effects of that impact must be studied, only the environmental impact effects of that action must be studied.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.000" offset="2174166">Now, we concede, Your Honors, that there is a sense in which the restart of TMI 1 changes the environment, and Respondent in this case argues from that, well, they will restart TMI 1, and that is an impact... that is a change in the environment, and that causes stress, but there is, we submit, a very critical muzzle in that argument, because the stress is produced not by the harmful consequences of the environmental impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.189" offset="2330900">There is no argument here that there will be a change in the water or the air which then produces stress in any kind of traumatic way.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.543" offset="2372278">The point that is being made is that the stress is a product of people's anxiety and fear that there may be a second accident here.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.493" offset="2416060">That is the impact that they are worried about.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.568" offset="2440406">Now, we think that the statute does not require for the government to make this separate and subsidiary inquiry, and we think it would be extremely undesirable from the viewpoint of the purposes of the statute to require this subsidiary impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.575" offset="2516474">We submit that it would really dilute and confuse the environmental impact process if this second order, rather confusing question... see, you go through the first inquiry, and you say, is this plant safe?</text>

          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="612.582" stopTime="618.830">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="612.582" offset="2588468">There is no question, is there, that the impact statement would have to consider the possibility of another accident?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_m_bator" startTime="618.830" stopTime="997.963">
            <label>Mr. Paul M. Bator</label>
            <text syncTime="618.830" offset="2613441">Yes, and in fact, did.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.205" offset="2618979">If Your Honors will look at the impact assessment that was conducted in connection with this restart in the joint appendix, there was an elaborate inquiry made into the question of risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.090" offset="2670492">That is, it is not our argument that only certain impacts count.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.713" offset="2685016">They have to, and we do consider the question of whether restart creates the possibility of a second accident, and that counts, because if there is such an accident, there would be a dreadful impact on the environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.424" offset="2739873">But we sharply distinguish between that inquiry and the question whether on restart people will be simply frightened of that accident, whatever actual risks there are.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.356" offset="2787521">That is, our submission, Your Honor, is that the intelligent way to deal with anxiety about accidents is to do everything possible under the sun to prevent them from happening, that is, that the rational way to deal with anxiety is to make this unit safe beyond a reasonable doubt, and to do it as openly as possible so that everybody understands the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.205" offset="2902982">But to underlay that inquiry with a separate inquiry into the question of what people's subjective perceptions with respect to safety are seems to us to dilute the central inquiry, and we further submit that it really has very little to do with the environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.900" offset="2977692">That is, anxieties are not... about safety are not identical with, they are not even necessarily parallel with concerns about the environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.535" offset="3024295">There are human anxieties about government interventions that are relatively benign environmentally.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.704" offset="3056895">And there may be huge human anxieties about interventions that are not at all benign.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.544" offset="3096288">In other words, there isn't a tracking between the anxiety issue and the environmental issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.416" offset="3119798">Furthermore, the very process of the rule announced by the Court of Appeals in this case, that there must be... that there is a legal rule that administrative agencies must make a formal inquiry in order to predict stress seems to us to create a confusing and diluting side issue into the real business of these agencies, including their concern for the environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.590" offset="3232438">That is to say that what will happen here is a fiercely controversial struggle about proper methodologies.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.682" offset="3264830">We don't make the point that stress can't be measured, but it is difficult, and it is controversial, and the methodologies for doing it are extremely controversial, and what will happen here as the opinion of the Court of Appeals stands, Your Honors, we believe, is that there will be very, very elaborate batteries of experts quarreling here, and a very rich opportunity for complicated procedures and complicated litigation about whether the proper methodologies were used, and whether the predicted stress was correctly and fairly measured.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.138" offset="3410698">Your Honor, I will take only one more minute of your time.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.712" offset="3428984">I want to draw the attention of the Court to the actual procedural history of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.752" offset="3473183">This is not a case where shortly after the accident the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said, well, let's start up this other plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.220" offset="3502962">That plant shut down in 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.185" offset="3518845">Since that time, there has been an immense administrative proceeding devoted to the question whether it is safe to start it again.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.541" offset="3552282">There were hearings, interventions, written submissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.678" offset="3580807">The oral hearings themselves took nine months.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.223" offset="3595018">They generated a 26,000-page transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.894" offset="3613722">These hearings were devoted to the central problems of this case, the questions whether it is safe to restart TMI 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.265" offset="3651233">These were questions of the design, of management, of technical capabilities, of emergency planning, all the other questions which the accident raised for TMI 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.478" offset="3708076">It was in connection with these proceedings that the Commission did... was quite aware that it had to... take account of compliance with NEPA, and it was clear from the beginning that the stress question would be a question here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1061.705" offset="4384961">The statute says, the environmental impact statement must consider the environmental impact of government interventions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1089.443" offset="4495929">On the other hand, we would argue fiercely that the fluoridation anxiety is not the kind of health effect that has independent status, because a stress effect that is produced simply by anxiety about the environment is not directly caused, as the statute requires, by an impact on the environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.602" offset="4596553">In other words, we really think that the statute contemplates the wise policy that this strung-out subsidiary mental health effect be restricted to those situations where it is pretty clear that there is an actual change in the water, or the land, or in the air, that directly propagates some kind of mental health change.</text>

            <text syncTime="1348.521" offset="5532259">May it please the Court, quoting to the Presidential Commission on the Accident at Three Mile Island,</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.377" offset="5567681">"That accident was the worst crisis yet experienced by the nation's nuclear power industry. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.922" offset="5589833">"It resulted in the evacuation of tens of thousands of people who lived in the area surrounding Three Mile Island. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.683" offset="5616895">And the President's Commission found that the most serious health effect of that accident was severe mental stress to that population.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.433" offset="5647824">PANE, my clients here, is an organization of local citizens who have lived and worked in the Three Mile Island area for many years, often for generations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.319" offset="5691397">PANE has alleged before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that the restart of TMI 1 would cause further health damage to this traumatized, sensitized population.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.437" offset="5743851">The factual allegation has never been challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.216" offset="5759002">The Court of Appeals ruled that NEPA requires the NRC to consider the health damage in the unique circumstances of Three Mile Island in reaching a decision on the restart of TMI 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.932" offset="5809888">Indeed, the Commission itself has issued a policy statement implementing the Court's decision in which the Commission interprets that decision to require consideration of psychological health damage only where there has been a nuclear accident, and where there has been a traumatized population, circumstances directly comparable to those now before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.341" offset="5903511">They are discussed at Page 42 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.156" offset="5914796">We believe the Commission's interpretation and application of that lower court's decision is entirely reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.512" offset="5940187">In fact, we would be satisfied if the Commission would simply implement its policy statement here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.588" offset="5956487">But this case turns on the language of Section 102(2)(c) of NEPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.915" offset="5977803">That section requires environmental... federal agencies to prepare environmental impact statements with respect to major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.</text>
