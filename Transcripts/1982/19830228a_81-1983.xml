            <text syncTime="52.523" offset="354005">She had been born in Panama where she was educated through the sixth grade, and moved to the United States in 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.692" offset="394652">Between that time and the time of filing her claim, she had worked as a maid in a hotel and as a seamstress and had injured her back moving a laundry truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.326" offset="445225">Her claim was denied initially and on reconsideration by the State agency, and she then requested a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.166" offset="492559">The Administrative Law Judge took evidence on her medical claims, on her back impairment and her other claims, and concluded that she was capable of doing light work as that term is defined in the regulations which are at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.082" offset="560268">The Administrative Law Judge also took evidence on respondent's age and education, and on her work experience and training, and after consulting the guidelines in Appendix 2 of the regulations, concluded that she was not disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.416" offset="637591">The respondent then sought review in the District Court which upheld the Secretary's determinations and respondent then appealed to the Second Circuit which reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.004" offset="687955">The Second Circuit held that in cases which can't be decided on the basis of medical evidence alone where the claimant is incapable of doing her prior work, the Secretary is required to show two things in order to find the claimant not disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.231" offset="776876">The first thing the court said the Secretary must demonstrate is what the claimant can do, that is to say, what kinds of physical activities like lifting and walking, and what sort of skills she may have acquired in her past work.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.084" offset="836226">With respect to that issue, the Court of Appeals concluded that the Secretary's determination that respondent was capable of doing light work was supported by substantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.127" offset="888471">The Court of Appeals said that the Secretary must also introduce evidence on a second question.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.717" offset="914802">The Court said that the Secretary must show what kinds of jobs are available for a person who is capable of doing what the claimant is capable of doing.</text>

            <text syncTime="221.941" offset="1031726">Respondent contends that the Court of Appeals was concerned about giving notice to claimants of the issues which are at stake in disability hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.826" offset="1079269">The Secretary understands the Court of Appeals to have done something more radical than that.</text>

            <label>Mr. John H. Garvey</label>
            <text syncTime="343.812" offset="1519171">As I understand the Court of Appeals, what it was concerned about was that, the Secretary had not complied with the procedures which the Courts had used to interpret the statutory term before these regulations had been passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.568" offset="1586149">Before the regulations were enacted, at disability hearings, the statute provided that where the case can't be decided on the basis of medical evidence alone, the Secretary was required to consider, under Section 223, the claimant's age, education, and work experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.875" offset="1663472">That job of considering those vocational factors, along with the claimant's medical impairment, in order to decide what kinds of jobs are available for the claimant, had been performed largely with the assistance of vocational experts.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.698" offset="1718747">These were people who were rehabilitation counsellors or directors of employment agencies, and under contract with the Social Security Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.675" offset="1762632">They would take the stand, after all of the evidence about the claimant's medical factors and vocational characteristics had been taken, and would be asked hypothetical questions by the Administrative Law Judge about what sorts of jobs would be available for such a claimant if the Court determined that he was able of doing light work.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.591" offset="1842254">The Court of Appeals, as I understand it, said in this case that the Secretary was required to continue to do that in order to give the claimant an opportunity to dispute the suitability and the availability of the jobs that were noticed.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.631" offset="1910485">I think the Court's decision is very much like, in fact I think it is identical to claims raised under 405(g) decided by the First, Third, Fifth, Seventh, and 11th Circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.827" offset="1963253">In each of those cases, what the claimant contended was that the Secretary's decision wasn't supported by substantial evidence if the Secretary didn't put on evidence about what kinds of jobs were out there that were suitable for a claimant of this sort.</text>

            <text syncTime="475.319" offset="2045173">Your cert petition treats it as though the Court had invalidated the grid system in some kind of regulations promulgated by the Secretary, and yet the Court didn't expressly do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.764" offset="2102956">Are you telling us, then, that it really is a case of sufficiency of the evidence?</text>

            <text syncTime="496.026" offset="2128033">You will notice in the Court of Appeals' opinion that at page 7-A it says, on the question of what this claimant can do, the record as a whole supports the Administrative Law Judge's finding that Ms. Campbell had the residual functional capacity to perform light work.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.254" offset="2196997">Then the Court goes on to say that there is a second question which must be decided, that is to say, what kinds of jobs are out there and what their demands are.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.595" offset="2230329">With respect to that, the Court said the Secretary's decision was not supported by substantial evidence because he had not introduced any evidence on that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.139" offset="2272438">But what the Secretary contends in this Court is that it is unnecessary for him to introduce any evidence on that question because the issue has already been resolved by the regulations.</text>

            <text syncTime="565.312" offset="2405140">What the Secretary concluded was that those issues are really legislative facts most appropriately determined in the course of rulemaking proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.389" offset="2437532">I might add that that conclusion corresponds to what this Court said in Matthews against Eldridge.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.541" offset="2462087">What the Court there said was, resolution of the inquiry as to the types of employment opportunities that exist in the national economy for a physically impaired worker with a particular set of skills would not necessarily be advanced by an evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.644" offset="2522482">Then the Court went on to quote a passage from Professor Davis's treatise dealing with legislative facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.750" offset="2546933">Then the Court concluded that the statistical information relevant to this judgment is more amenable to written than to oral presentation.</text>

            <text syncTime="640.721" offset="2706802">At the top of 9-A what the Court says is that in future cases, in past... before and after adoption of the guidelines, this Court has required the Secretary to identify specific alternative occupations, supported by a job description clarifying the nature of the job and demonstrating that the job does not require exertion or skills not possessed by the claimant.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.115" offset="2804396">The Court then goes on to say that in the past this has been done largely through the use of vocational testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.082" offset="2828219">Then the Court says at the top of page 10-A that if the Secretary is going to dispense with the use of vocational experts, what he has got to do is provide a similar degree of specificity, and concludes</text>

            <text syncTime="761.885" offset="3191426">I should add that with respect to all of the facts that are unique to any given claimant, with respect to that claimant's medical condition, physical impairments, mental impairments, the claimant's age, what kind of training the claimant has, what kind of education she has got, what work she has done in the past, on all of those questions, once the disability inquiry reaches the last stage, the Secretary still maintains or still shoulders the burden of proof showing that the claimant is capable of engaging in activity, all of that notwithstanding, and the regulations specifically provide that all of those issues are open to rebuttal at the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.789" offset="3351086">It might be useful for me just to describe briefly the reason for adopting these regulations and say a few words about the way they work, and then say a little bit more about what it was that the Secretary believes the Court of Appeals decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.589" offset="3442306">Until 1978, before these regulations were adopted, indeed today, most disability cases can be decided on the basis of medical evidence alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.804" offset="3499148">It will either show that the claimant is so impaired that she is unable to do any work regardless of what her vocational characteristics are, or it will show that the claimant's impairment is not sufficiently severe to warrant further inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.985" offset="3559857">In cases which can't be decided simply on the basis of medical evidence, the promulgation of the regulations was designed to displace the use of vocational experts at hearings in determining the question of what kinds of jobs were available and suitable for claimants who are described by the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.665" offset="3646583">The general theme of the regulations is this: For claimants whose impairments are not sufficiently severe to warrant the conclusion of the question right there, among people who have similar impairments, what the regulations do is to say that the older you are, the more likely it is that you will be impaired, that you will be disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.216" offset="3748774">Or, the less education you have, or the less training you have, for people who have similar impairments, the ones who are less educated, less well-trained, have no skills, it is those people who have an easier time proving disability under the regulations which are at stake in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.755" offset="3818992">What the tables... At the conclusion in Appendix 2, what those tables do is to classify jobs according to their gross physical demands.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.235" offset="3864863">For example, the table that deals with light work in this case assumes that people who are able to do light work are able to undertake such activities as carrying more than ten pounds frequently, and occasionally 20 pounds, that they are able to do a good deal of walking or standing or, if the job involves sitting, they are able to do such things as pushing or pulling of arm and leg controls.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.646" offset="3970502">For people whose impairment is only of that sort, only in the kinds of gross physical demands of which the tables take notice, the Secretary has said that for those who are capable of doing light work, that there are some 1600 jobs, different types of occupations in the national economy, which can be performed by people of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.775" offset="4067050">These are simple jobs that anybody can learn to do in less than 30 days.</text>

            <text syncTime="2367.162" offset="9612533">--Your Honor, but the problem is that the regulations do not contain a list of the jobs, and that's the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.987" offset="9635834">In order to find out what jobs the Secretary is assuming that a claimant who fits a grid structure can perform, the claimant would have to go to other more difficult and less available sources, such as the Dictionary for Occupational Titles, and several publications of several agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.872" offset="9711380">So even if the claimant is told that her claim will be decided under the medical and vocational regulations, and that she should read those regulations, assuming that the claimant can't understand the regulations and can't travel to the District Office, the claimant would not know what jobs the Secretary is assuming that she or he can perform.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.658" offset="9798525">Your Honor was absolutely right earlier in this argument when he said that the claimant should be given an opportunity to testify about those factors which limit the grid applicability, and the Secretary stated in his argument that grids come into play only where claimant has limitations in terms of his or her ability to meet strength requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.586" offset="9922241">They do not come into play if the claimant has a significant non-exertional limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.910" offset="9947527">If the claimant has significant visual or auditory problems, problems in terms of environmental conditions, if inability to tolerate gases, fumes, anything, any limitation that is not measured out in terms of strength would limit the application of the grid to that claimant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.948" offset="10023700">In this case, Mrs. Campbell was not told that she had to testify about these types of limitations because they would be relevant in determining whether the grid was applicable to her.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.335" offset="10069258">So that this record, even less the evidence which was necessary for a determination of whether the grid was applicable at all, the determination by the Second Circuit that Mrs. Campbell did not have an meaningful chance to present her evidence because the Secretary had not given her notice, I think is entitled to affirmance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.371" offset="10165388">It is a factual determination that is amply supported in the record of this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2912.831" offset="11795220">But this statement was made by the ALJ at the beginning of the hearing when he was explaining to Mrs. Campbell all the relevant procedures... all the relevant Social Security procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.794" offset="11855093">He explained her appeals right.</text>

            <text syncTime="2983.891" offset="12079537">If you look at the record of the transcript where Mrs. Campbell is in fact testifying about her capacities, that is only two pages in the transcript, it appears on page... basically on page 50 and the first half of page 51, she, for example, stated:</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.607" offset="12162397">"I cannot sit too long. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.198" offset="12168771">"I cannot stand too long. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.104" offset="12176294">That is at the bottom of page 49.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.729" offset="12186848">Instead of the ALJ asking her, how long can you sit?</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.679" offset="12202626">How many pounds can you lift?</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.693" offset="12214747">because that was critical to the determination of her claim, the ALJ changed the line of her testimony by asking "Can you bend"?</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.456" offset="12245780">"I cannot bend. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.766" offset="12251005">"The doctor warned me not to lift weights. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.108" offset="12264379">There the ALJ again changes the line of her testimony and says,</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.792" offset="12283083">"I notice that you have stood up several times. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.055" offset="12296144">Further down the page, she is again testifying about her limitations, and she is saying:</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.351" offset="12325297">"I cannot raise. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.943" offset="12331671">"I can't do anything too much. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.131" offset="12340448">The ALJ instead of trying to elicit her testimony with any specificity, which was required for application of the grid, the ALJ again changed around her testimony by asking about her medical treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.109" offset="12388409">This record clearly establishes that Mrs. Campbell did not put into the record the evidence which was necessary for the determination of her claim under the grid, and that she did not present her evidence because the Secretary never informed her of what it was that she needed to prove.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.789" offset="12471060">I would like to clarify a statement by the Court of Appeals which has been relied on by the Secretary in his papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.923" offset="12519648">The Secretary says that the finding by the Court of Appeals that there was substantial evidence to support the finding that Mrs. Campbell could perform light work is very important, and in fact shows that Mrs. Campbell was in... that Mrs. Campbell's ability to work was properly considered by the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.319" offset="12625183">It should be pointed out that there are two different purposes for judicial review in disability determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.254" offset="12668964">One is whether the Secretary's determination is supported by substantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.297" offset="12685160">The other one is whether the Secretary followed proper procedures in determining the claimant's application for benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.498" offset="12725911">By saying that considering whatever evidence was already in the record of Mrs. Campbell's proceeding, the determination that she could perform light work may have found some support, the Secretary was not sanctioning the way in which the ALJ arrived at that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.692" offset="12810652">On several occasions the Second Circuit has remanded cases to the Secretary despite finding the determinations, the specific determination supported by substantial evidence precisely because the claimant was not given an opportunity to introduce contrary evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.590" offset="12882332">All that the Second Circuit did in this case was to determine factually that Mrs. Campbell did not have notice and did not have the opportunity to present evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.850" offset="12935308">That determination is amply supported by the record of the case, and should be affirmed by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.442" offset="12965715">Furthermore, the determination... the direction to the Secretary that he has to give meaningful and informative knowledge to Mrs. Campbell on the remanded hearing is consistent with the Secretary's own regulations, with the Secretary's own argument, and should also be affirmed by this Court.</text>

            <label>Mr. John H. Garvey</label>
            <text syncTime="3234.134" offset="13080445">I have a couple of brief points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.741" offset="13086923">The first is with respect to the contention that the respondent had no opportunity to put on evidence regarding her non-exertional impairments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.599" offset="13126316">As Justice Stevens pointed out, at the beginning of the hearing, the ALJ informed respondent that any non-exertional impairments that she might have would be issues in the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.232" offset="13168843">In our reply brief, at pages 11 to 14, in the notes we indicate the passages at which each of those contentions was addressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.653" offset="13198518">I should add that in those kinds of cases where non-exertional impairments are present, then the question is what kind of work somebody can do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.634" offset="13226417">The tables are not used, as I emphasized before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.134" offset="13236448">What will happen in those kinds of cases most often is that the Secretary will call a vocational expert to see what kind of work is available for people who can do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.505" offset="13269989">With the respect to the question of her representation by counsel, I might just add a point which does not appear in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.908" offset="13307605">A Senate Finance Committee report, CP-9716, issued just in August of '82, indicates that, contrary to what Professor Davis thinks, in disability cases, 71 percent of claimants are in fact represented by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.805" offset="13367165">I might add that for those claimants who are not represented by counsel, the notice which they receive in advance of hearing tells them, as they told respondent in this case, that</text>
