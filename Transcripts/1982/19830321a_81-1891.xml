            <text syncTime="2.328" offset="155401">We will hear arguments next in Morrison-knudsen construction against the Director.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.700" offset="184867">Mr. Larson, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready now.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="arthur_larson" startTime="63.209" stopTime="211.446">
            <label>Mr. Arthur Larson</label>
            <text syncTime="63.209" offset="398862">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="67.442" offset="415789">The question in this case is under the Longshoremen's Compensation Act should employer contributions into union trust funds for health and welfare, pensions and training for the first time in history be included in the concept of the individual's average weekly wage for purposes of calculating his benefits, adding on the average of 30 % to 40 % to those benefits which now stand at 88 % of take-home pay?</text>
            <text syncTime="112.282" offset="595198">The legal issue, of course, is the intent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.297" offset="611185">Unfortunately, all the three major indicators of that intent, the clear language of the statute, the legislative history of the Act and of its amendments, and above all, the fact that Congress could not possibly have intended an interpretation of the Act that would severely damage the functioning of the Act and its ability to carry out its purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.597" offset="728423">First, I would like to say just a word about why this case came as such a bombshell to the compensation community.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.688" offset="764785">Workers' compensation has been with us for 70 years and the Longshoremen's Act for 55.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.231" offset="798953">During that time literally tens of millions of cases have been disposed of on the understanding that wages meant wages along with traditional non-cash wage substitutes such as board and lodging.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.802" offset="873245">Now, suddenly we are being told that all those thousands of judges and administrators and lawyers and employers and employees and unions were wrong all along in what they thought wage included and overnight we are supposed to accept a new meaning of wage which, believe it or not, will raise benefits above pre-injury take-home pay and all this by judicial, not legislative action.</text>

          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="211.446" stopTime="221.568">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="211.446" offset="991841">Mr. Larson, would you tell us what happened to the legislation that had been introduced in the Congress, I guess, to overrule the decision below?</text>

            <text syncTime="222.115" offset="1034473">There is a bill pending in Congress right now... There was a bill last year which passed the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.361" offset="1063521">The bill pending in Congress now has a small clause in there which in effect would undo the effect of this for the future.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>

            <label>Mr. Arthur Larson</label>
            <text syncTime="240.795" offset="1109183">So far this year I don't think anything has happened.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="242.669" stopTime="245.294">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="242.669" offset="1116707">And last year the House took no action?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="arthur_larson" startTime="245.294" stopTime="295.930">
            <label>Mr. Arthur Larson</label>
            <text syncTime="245.294" offset="1127260">No, they took no action last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.106" offset="1130499">Now, of course, there are two reasons at least why this doesn't really affect this decision very much.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.055" offset="1166235">The first is, as we all know, it is a long distance between introducing a bill, especially on workers' compensation, and getting it passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.381" offset="1199567">But, the other is that even if it were passed, enormous damage would be done just in cases now pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.470" offset="1231959">A lot of them are hanging fire right at the moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.953" offset="1241885">But, even more seriously, under the very permissive reopening provisions of the Longshoremen's Act, tens of thousands of cases would be reopened on the theory that there was a mistake of fact in the determination of the benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.322" offset="1311371">So, most of the damaging consequences, as we have outlined in our brief, would happen.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="295.930" stopTime="309.689">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="295.930" offset="1329761">Assuming you are correct, what happens to things like medical insurance premiums that might be paid to a fund by the employer in the future?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="arthur_larson" startTime="309.689" stopTime="369.758">
            <label>Mr. Arthur Larson</label>
            <text syncTime="309.689" offset="1384828">There are, of course, all kinds of benefits under this plan and the various others that occur and under some plans the medical payments go on during disability and others they don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.512" offset="1440103">Of course, in the case of death cases, they would not go on.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.683" offset="1452746">But, what we keep coming back to in this case is, of course, the intent of Congress and the intent of Congress is very well expressed in this case in the short but very specific definition we have been provided which is that wages means the money rate at which the service rendered is recompensed under the contract of hire in force at the time of injury, including the reasonable value of board, room, housing, lodging, or similar advantage received from the employer and gratuities received in the course of employment from others than the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.103" offset="1614496">Now, the simplest way for the Court to dispose of this--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="369.758" stopTime="383.551">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="369.758" offset="1625050">Of course, that is the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.961" offset="1629856">So, if you are right, how do we distinguish in the future between payments such as rent and board and, on the other hand, medical insurance?</text>
            <text syncTime="382.129" offset="1674578">I mean, what is the line?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="arthur_larson" startTime="383.551" stopTime="435.389">
            <label>Mr. Arthur Larson</label>
            <text syncTime="383.551" offset="1680220">--The principal distinction... This is the one that has always controlled these cases of so-called similar advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.922" offset="1709686">There are two things: Similar advantage means, if it means anything, having a clear and present cash value now and also being paid directly by the employer to the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.511" offset="1760050">Those are the distinctions under which... For example, vacation pay is included and overtime and under certain circumstances transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.413" offset="1799652">Well, obviously, the fund payments aren't the money rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.020" offset="1826088">That, in the common term, is the cents per hours paid to the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.581" offset="1848344">It certainly isn't board, it isn't lodging, it isn't housing, and, as I have just indicated, it isn't similar advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.202" offset="1882826">Now, there is another way this Court--</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="435.389" offset="1887632">Mr. Larson, I suppose that some payments by an employer of board or lodging might not be paid directly to the employee at all.</text>

            <label>Mr. Arthur Larson</label>
            <text syncTime="447.899" offset="1937683">--Well, I think in almost every case it is either furnished directly or the money is furnished directly, but it has a present cash value and this is a traditional thing and it is written, of course,... It is written right into the statute so it can't be controversial.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="460.598" stopTime="464.315">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="460.598" offset="1988465">Would certain medical benefits have a present cash value then?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="arthur_larson" startTime="464.315" stopTime="673.325">
            <label>Mr. Arthur Larson</label>
            <text syncTime="464.315" offset="2003303">They might, yes, but they are not paid by the employer to the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.688" offset="2020752">That is one of the difficulties.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.641" offset="2028589">And, they are not written into the statute as part of the definition which makes a crucial distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.606" offset="2056488">I think another... A simply way the Court could dispose of this case would be by direct application of the rationale of Potomac Electric Power Company against the Director decided by this Court just two terms ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.960" offset="2117928">There this Court held that since the Longshoremen's Act was copied verbatim from the New York one and since it employed terms which had accepted meaning in 1927 when the Longshoremen's Act was passed, Congress should be deemed to have intended the meaning that prevailed at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.029" offset="2210192">Now, to carry out over to the present situation, it is only necessary to observe that when the Longshoremen's Act was first passed the meaning of wages that we are talking about was not only dominant, which is the word in Pepco, it was absolutely universal.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.882" offset="2277588">But, now I think we can carry this down to the present more cogently by applying the Pepco principle to the 1972 amendments which were in effect, the re-enactment... they were such massive amendments... particularly because the central concern of the 1972 amendments was exactly what we are talking about here, the benefit level.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.901" offset="2397647">The remedy chosen by Congress to deal with that benefit level problem was to make the ceiling flexible and, indeed, the benefits went from $70 a week to $500.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.878" offset="2465565">Now, as you recall, the heart of the 1972 amendments was a sort of trade off between the longshoreman giving up his rights of unseaworthiness against a ship in exchange for a dramatic increase in compensation benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.635" offset="2544560">Now, the point, for present purposes, is that in striking this balance everybody had to start from a common understanding of what wages included.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.709" offset="2584893">If it had ever occurred to anybody that a new meaning of wage was going to come along that would in itself raise the benefits 30 % to 40 %, can anybody suppose that this same balance would have been struck.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.702" offset="2648841">This was not an oversight.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.123" offset="2662529">By 1972, these fund contributions into union plans were a very conspicuous feature of the labor sea and Congress had just a few years before had to deal with it in connection with the Davis-Bacon Act which has a sort of parallel history to the Longshoremen's Act and it dealt with it by simply writing a detailed provision into the Davis-Bacon Act spelling out that union fund contributions are included in the concept of wage.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.905" offset="2809650">Now, in '72, Congress, in connection with the Longshoremen's Act, theoretically could have done the same thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="718.135" offset="3018630">Now, as to the third and final part of the congressional intent, I am going to take again as my text a passage from Pepco in which this Court said it is not to be lightly assumed that Congress intended the Act to produce incongruous results.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.049" offset="3090205">Well, the decision below would produce results that are not only incongruous but severely damaging to the entire functioning of the system.</text>

            <text syncTime="1114.678" offset="4604785">Well, as for being fixed, they won't be fixed at all because there is going to have to be an individual, tailor-made calculation for each employee in relation to each employer as to each fund, and some employers have ten of them, against the backdrop of controversy about what kinds of benefits should go in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.232" offset="4698930">We just have a small sample here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.215" offset="4702901">There are many, many others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.919" offset="4705722">And, the worst controversy of all is how do you evaluate all these assorted plans?</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.057" offset="4734248">Some are on a per-hour basis, some are on a per-tonnage basis, some of them are on an arbitrary actuarial basis in which the employee simply pays in whatever is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.600" offset="4772491">So, far from being immediate, the benefits would be delayed by years, and as for being without litigation, of course, litigation will be enormously increased.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.563" offset="4816272">There is another very direct way in which the worker is going to get hurt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.733" offset="4840932">Let me just say here I think everybody realizes that this whole system of compensation is all about the worker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.901" offset="4877608">It is not about insurance companies, it is not about employers, it is about the worker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.165" offset="4898715">And, if the system gets undermined, the worker and his dependents are going to be the ones that ultimately lose and this is one of the ways they are going to lose, by the delay in their payments for years, whereas now, at least so far as this item is concerned, they are virtually automatic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.660" offset="4960677">But, there is another way that could even be more seriously damaging to particular employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.078" offset="4982411">In New York Harbor, for example, the compensation premium is $84 to $87 per hundred of payroll.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.685" offset="5012818">In some Canadian ports that are competitive, it is $3.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.933" offset="5037791">Three to four thousand jobs have already been lost from New York Harbor to Canadian points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.322" offset="5063286">Now, that may partially explain the fact that neither the International Longshoremen's Association nor any other union of longshoremen has joined in this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.208" offset="5114904">In the District of Columbia, about 15,000 jobs were lost in six years largely for the same reasons which may explain the fact while the &lt;AFLCIO&gt; [=AFL-CIO] District Council filed a brief in a petition for certiorari, they have not filed a brief on the matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="1308.869" offset="5381562">This premise is false.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.494" offset="5388041">In fact, common sense does not dictate that these contributions must be covered and that is particularly true in the workers' compensation context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.771" offset="5425134">Such contributions are generally not treated as wages in other contexts and they have never been so treated under the Longshoremen's Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.112" offset="5458467">This is so, because the contributions, even as viewed in the abstract, are quite different from ordinary wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.952" offset="5489814">They are paid to union administered funds and they benefit particular employees only in an uncertain and indirect way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.590" offset="5520429">Moreover and more important, in the specific workers' compensation context, they are unlike wages in that they generally do not represent income loss to the employees' beneficiaries by reason of his disability or death and, therefore, income that must be made up by the longshoremen's benefit in order to pay expenses that the widow will have to pay later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.737" offset="5613007">I would like to speak first to Justice O'Connor's question earlier about whether there is really value to some of these things that must be replaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.779" offset="5665148">One thing that is important to note is that the Court of Appeals itself never attempted to value these benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.354" offset="5687508">It is true that something like medical insurance does have a value to the worker and to his family, but the Court of Appeals never made any effort to assess that value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.132" offset="5726588">It just arbitrarily picked these contributions that are made by the employer to these funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.020" offset="5750098">These contributions are not made to the benefit of a particular employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.034" offset="5770160">They are just made to the funds in general.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.595" offset="5780400">Now, the fund invests those contributions in a way that does rebound to the benefits, to the benefit of employees as a whole but not in a way that rebounds the benefit of a particular employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.513" offset="5832122">I think that can be seen by looking at the pension plan involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.635" offset="5864619">Employees make contributions or... Excuse me, the employer makes contributions for every hour worked by and employee, but an employee does not necessarily receive pension credit for each of those hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.584" offset="5912370">There is a certain minimum level he must reach before any pension credits are accrued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.082" offset="5930343">He may receive the same pension credit for different levels of hours that he works and unless he vests, which in this case, I believe, requires ten years of service, something Mr. Hilyer never had, he does not ultimately receive any pension.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.311" offset="5987290">Now, as far as... in the specific longshoremen's context, whether it makes sense to consider these contributions within the wage base, I think it is important to look at the question of whether there is going to be a double recovery by including these benefits in the wage base.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.207" offset="6082898">The fact that they may have value to the employee at the time he is working for the employer does not necessarily mean that his beneficiaries need money to cover those expenses once he has become disabled or died.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.609" offset="6136501">I think it would be instructive to look at each of the benefits on their own in assessing this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.091" offset="6162414">Life insurance is the most obvious example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.167" offset="6178715">It is true that Mr. Hilyer received a benefit when the union-administered funds were used to purchase a life insurance policy on his life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.867" offset="6217481">But, now that he has passed away, there is certainly no need for his beneficiary here to receive a benefit to cover the expenses of purchasing such a policy on her own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.768" offset="6253112">There is no need to have a policy on Mr. Hilyer's life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.893" offset="6265650">In fact, she has already received the benefits of that policy which was paid out when he died.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.453" offset="6287907">The same is true of other types of benefits that are purchased by these employer contributions through the union-administered funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.465" offset="6323956">Disability insurance, unemployment insurance, there is certainly no need for Mrs. Hilyer to go out and purchase on here own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.743" offset="6356974">The training fund that is specifically referred to in the Court of Appeals' opinion is certainly not for the benefit of Mrs. Hilyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.881" offset="6385605">Indeed, it seems to be not for the benefit of particular employees at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.128" offset="6410578">The same is true of pensions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.268" offset="6415071">And, I would like to focus on pensions to some extent, because the Court of Appeals specifically mentioned pensions as something that Mrs. Hilyer would have to go out and purchase on her own later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.030" offset="6454150">The purpose of a pension fund is to provide for the replacement of income upon retirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.184" offset="6478810">Now, the need to receive these pension payments is triggered by a specific event, retirement or the ending of a person's employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.900" offset="6513605">That has already happened in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.852" offset="6521441">Mr. Hilyer is not going to retire in the future and the death benefit that he received under the Longshoremen's Act begins upon his death and will continue up through the period that he would have been working and beyond the period when he would have retired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.422" offset="6587688">So, in that sense, the death benefit itself is its own pension.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.234" offset="6602943">So, there is no reason for Mrs. Hilyer to go out now and invest in an annuity or something like that to provide a pension.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.935" offset="6625827">The Longshoremen's Act has already provided that pension for her.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.996" offset="6638052">So, for her to receive an additional benefit by including the pension contributions in her wage base is nothing more than a double recovery.</text>

            <text syncTime="1686.972" offset="6893948">I would like to speak to Justice O'Connor's question about whether rent payments, which are specifically authorized by the statute should perhaps, under the theory propounded by Petitioner, really ought not be considered in the wage base either if they are paid, say, directly to the apartment building rather than the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.038" offset="7018186">I think there is a big difference between that situation, where there is essentially a shortcut taken in the payment, rather than paying the money to the employee who then passes it on to the apartment building, the money is paid directly to the apartment building.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.016" offset="7070117">That is nothing more than a shortcut, but what we have here is a detour and a very long and uncertain detour.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.515" offset="7088090">The money is not paid directly to the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.232" offset="7098957">It is paid to these funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.247" offset="7107002">But, as we explained in our brief, the funds are not simply a channel like the Court of Appeals said, for the money to be passed on to the employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="1751.961" offset="7153918">Well, in a case like this where the employee has died and if the union had given him an insurance policy to cover the medical benefits for his entire family, that probably is an expense that the beneficiaries would have to pick up afterwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.689" offset="7228837">In a disability case I am not sure that would be so because these insurance policies often continue for disabled employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.825" offset="7257363">I think my answer to that question has to be that you have to look at the Act as a whole and at these benefits as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.447" offset="7287874">There is no way under the statutory definition really to distinguish between life insurance, medical insurance, training funds, et cetera, et cetera.</text>

            <text syncTime="2770.954" offset="11229856">You see, an employee now can deduct, defer is the right word, the income from these benefits until he retires, until he actually receives them.</text>

            <text syncTime="2830.087" offset="11466421">Now, the Title 26 is very clear about this.</text>

            <text syncTime="3409.275" offset="13783169">Let me go back for a moment to Davis-Bacon as a matter of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.976" offset="13805948">As part of the general exaggeration of these facts, we have a very curious happening in Davis-Bacon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.517" offset="13856103">Remember, you were told that the amendment to this Act went back to 1964 and that it had a parallel history to the Workmen's Compensation Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.919" offset="13905735">It was never amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.449" offset="13915871">It was supplemented but never amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.510" offset="13928096">You see, there never was a definition that kept out fringe benefits in the Davis-Bacon Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.789" offset="13953174">Congress was intent on seeing that they were, in fact, put in to the Act and, therefore, supplemented it in 1964, almost 20 years ago which shows that Congress is really not behind the times.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.423" offset="14019734">Let me take the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.952" offset="14033840">I have already mentioned the fact that the benefits are negotiable and that leads, of course, to the Labor Management Relations Act which created employee trusts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.370" offset="14079502">Apparently Congress distrusted the unions on these funds to the extent that it created the trust form of handling, gave the right to the union and to the individual to make sure that the contributions were put into it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.364" offset="14143554">And, in Section 17 of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act it is provided that whatever you have received from one of the union benefit plans you may have to return if you get workmen's compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.308" offset="14223280">You may have to put it back into the trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.870" offset="14237490">Now, nothing, I think, could be clearer than to show that what is paid into these trusts, if paid out without compensation, must be put back if you get compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.645" offset="14300602">The interrelationship of the two is fascinating.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.955" offset="14321918">By the way, there is a typo in the Hilyer brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.344" offset="14335397">It says it is Section 7 when in fact it is Section 17, but it has been identified two or three other places as 17.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.403" offset="14363610">That is on page 24.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.278" offset="14371133">Let's come down to the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.667" offset="14392762">As I have already mentioned, you have to offset both disability and compensation and pension trust benefits from what you receive under Medicare and under ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.114" offset="14446470">You have in tax... I have already talked about the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.627" offset="14472592">I take it that this Court is fully familiar with Section 501(c) of the Title 26 which in Section 5 exempts all labor organizations from tax, which in Section 17 exempts benefit plan trusts such as these three from tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.571" offset="14552318">In Section 22 also exempts government retirement funds from tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.788" offset="14577187">And, Congress passed a law, as you probably know, in the Economic Recovery Tax Act that forbids the Internal Revenue Service from issuing any regulations on how to tax these benefits and this runs through the end of 1983 and probably... And, since this is the third extension, I am sure it will be extended again or it is reasonable.</text>
