            <label>Mr. Larry E. Forrester</label>
            <text syncTime="45.043" offset="322172">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="48.853" offset="337428">In January of 1978 the Petitioner Belknap employed approximately 400 people in a bargaining unit represented by the Teamsters Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.037" offset="382150">On February 1st of 1978 the Teamsters called a strike of the bargaining unit because the parties were unable to agree upon the terms of a new collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.045" offset="426140">On that same date Belknap advertised in the local newspaper for permanent replacements for these striking employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.981" offset="465950">Simultaneously, Belknap implemented an across the board wage increase for all employees in the bargaining unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.245" offset="498969">During the course of the strike there were unfair labor practice charges filed against Belknap and by Belknap against the union for conduct occurring on the picket line.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.660" offset="540661">In April of 1978 the National Labor Relations Board issued a complaint against Belknap, contending that their unilateral wage increase at the inception of the strike was an unfair labor practice and that it violated Belknap's duty to bargain with the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.966" offset="609833">In July of that year, before a hearing on these unfair labor practice matters before the Labor Board occurred, the regional director for the Labor Board in Cincinnati directed the parties to the labor dispute to attend a meeting at the regional's office in Cincinnati and encouraged the parties to resume negotiations to resolve the labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.287" offset="699172">As a result of this meeting, concessions were made by both parties concerning the terms of their collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.280" offset="731145">There were compromises made by the union and by the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.077" offset="750267">The ultimate issue between the parties that separated them was the status of the strikers vis a vis the status of the strike replacements.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.479" offset="787883">It was Belknap's position that the strike replacements would be retained.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.838" offset="805333">The union, of course, contended that the strikers should be returned to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.818" offset="825291">The parties were unable to make an agreement on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.741" offset="840964">The regional director for the Labor Board suggested a compromise whereby Belknap would agree to recall 35 striking employees per month, even though this may require that the replacement employees be laid off.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.890" offset="901568">On the basis of this compromise, the parties reached a strike settlement agreement and settled the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.528" offset="936050">Part and parcel of this settlement was the withdrawal of unfair labor practice charges by Belknap and by the Teamsters Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.211" offset="966874">Also, related state court litigation concerning strike violence during the course of the strike was dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.738" offset="992892">All pending litigation was dismissed in conjunction with the strike settlement agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.270" offset="1019015">After this settlement agreement was consummated, the replacements, represented by Respondents herein, sued in state court, contending that their layoff occasioned by the terms of the strike settlement agreement constituted breaches of state law concerning misrepresentation with regard to offering them permanent employment in the first place, and also breaches of contract with regard to terminating their employment after they had been offered permanent employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.131" offset="1150463">The trial court dismissed these state claims upon the grounds that they were preempted by the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.003" offset="1185990">The Court of Appeals of Kentucky reversed, contending that the subject matter concerned a matter of compelling state interest and was of only peripheral concern to the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.496" offset="1235936">The Supreme Court of Kentucky ultimately denied discretionary review, and it raises the issue for this Court whether or not the state court claims are preempted under the National Labor Relations Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1962.380" offset="7991514">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.051" offset="8002172">Let me answer a couple of inquiries if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.001" offset="8025996">The rules of procedure in the State of Kentucky are paraphrased in 1954 from the Federal Rules and with very few exceptions are the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.809" offset="8073225">And this was a motion for summary judgment, which is the same as it is under the Federal Rules, or the interpretation is the same in Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.615" offset="8124425">And this was therefore an appeal from that summary judgment of the Jefferson Circuit Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.316" offset="8147204">This case was first removed to U.S. district court, then remanded back to state court, then upon a motion for summary judgment, before very little proof was taken... only one deposition had been taken... to test the pleadings and test the law, the motion for a summary judgment was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.887" offset="8229542">It was sustained in the Jefferson Circuit Court and thereupon it was appealed to our Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.601" offset="8256396">Our Court of Appeals reversed the Jefferson Circuit Court and held in the opinion that has been referred to that it was only a peripheral concern to the national scene and the national Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.019" offset="8310104">I believe the thing that bothered me concerning this case, and it's bothered me for some couple of years since we have been going through this process, and I think that was finally answered here today, and I feel more at ease.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.745" offset="8384919">In our bowing down to the holy grail of National Labor Relations Board preemption and unusual policy of handling labor law, we have lost sight of the very most important thing, and that is the 400 replacements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.749" offset="8492961">What happens to them?</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.891" offset="8497559">Do they fall through the crack in philosophical theories of the best way for the best and largest good to handle the overall peace?</text>

            <text syncTime="2097.982" offset="8533921">Mr. Davenport, could I ask you, suppose the federal labor law said that in a strike, during a strike until it's... at least up until a certain point in a strike, an employer may hire replacements, but he may not hire anybody on a permanent basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.301" offset="8607168">Just suppose the federal law said that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.128" offset="8618453">Then the employer nevertheless, in hiring replacements, promises a permanent job.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.892" offset="8641545">Now, you wouldn't say that that contract would be enforceable if it's just... if it's an illegal contract, would you?</text>

            <text syncTime="2170.730" offset="8824925">Now, it's tough on the 400 replacements, but nevertheless they made an illegal contract with the employer.</text>

            <text syncTime="2255.510" offset="9163994">Well, apparently under the overall policy and regulations laid down by the Board, the offer of a wage is an unfair inducement to entice off the picket line those back in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.502" offset="9227942">But the hiring of replacement employees per se would not likewise be an inducement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.500" offset="9260021">I mean, it might be a threat to them, but it is certainly not an inducement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.139" offset="9278515">What we have here is attempting to broaden the scope and the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board under the guise of the broad terms "arguably protected" or under the broad terms of the necessity to give economic weapons and create a detente, so to speak, a philosophical theory of governing the labor peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.377" offset="9399514">Now, this has been going on for a long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.125" offset="9410486">But it is inconceivable to us that in this process, if the theory of the NLRB were taken and if it were sanctioned by this Court, it is inconceivable that there could be 400 people in these United States that would not be treated in the same substantial fashion as the rest of the population.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.631" offset="9508497">How are these people, for instance, to know that they must govern themselves in dealing with an employer in an entirely different situation if he has a strike going than they would be correspondingly required to deal with that same employer when there is no strike in evidence?</text>

            <text syncTime="2537.331" offset="10291335">And may I point out where that is in error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.519" offset="10300008">We've relied greatly upon Linn versus United Plant Guard Workers of America, and let me quote from that, page 663 of that opinion:</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.064" offset="10342221">"Nor should the fact that defamation. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.373" offset="10355492">--this was a tort; this was a defamation action between a manager of a plant on the employer after the strike was over against the union for libel and slander with regard to leaflets, et cetera, and this Court says:</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.272" offset="10419021">"Nor should the fact that defamation arises during a labor dispute give the Board exclusive jurisdiction to remedy its consequences. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.348" offset="10451413">So just because... and that's what they're really saying, that tort actions, which the states have had original jurisdiction since the inception of the Constitution, has been diminished, or jurisdiction over those torts and/or contracts, has been diminished to the extent that it has been preempted by the provisions of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.372" offset="10539498">And all we are saying is that this could never arguably be of any problem to the Board in extending its jurisdiction to mediate the peace of a labor industry as long as you require the employer simply to tell the truth and be honest about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.786" offset="10613163">It doesn't afford any harm to the overall administration of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.547" offset="10632181">And torts have been brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.688" offset="10640749">I think we have to, if I may, analyze the cases that have been decided by this Court previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.934" offset="10677738">The principal case is that of Linn versus United Plant Guard Workers of America, and this was a case in which the manager of the employer's plant after a strike brought suit for defamation of character, libel and slander against the union for the dissemination of leaflets and scandalous material in those leaflets concerning him during a strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.376" offset="10803439">And the Court held that that tort could be litigated by state court under two or three different theories, number one being it was such a complete concern to the respective states that it was not arguably within the purview or would not disturb the overall policy of the labor movement by allowing the states, which had a greater concern than did the labor movement with regard to that particular type of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.658" offset="10944605">Now, let's consider... and there are only two... there are only really four cases on which torts have been allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.937" offset="10977728">Two of those, they were allowed; two of those, they would have been allowed except the facts were not appropriate, the Linn being the principal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.636" offset="11004478">Now, let's consider what the similarities are between the Linn case and this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.290" offset="11027152">There were torts committed in both cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.694" offset="11040736">There was misrepresentation in both cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.647" offset="11060589">The injury... there was injury in both cases, except in our case it's a lot greater.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.502" offset="11087965">It's 400 to one greater.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.080" offset="11098310">There are 400 people here who were just summarily discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.124" offset="11114505">There were many of these workers who took, in pursuance to that advertisement, jobs at lesser pay because the current jobs they had were seasonal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.247" offset="11154943">There were people who left secure jobs to go because of the advantages advertised and guaranteed by that advertisement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.849" offset="11189425">And they have been work... some of them have been out of work ever since.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.944" offset="11205725">The same... in the Linn case and in our case, in both cases the action was... the Defendant's action was not protected in either one of these cases by any constitutional provision, and in both of these cases the National Labor Relations Board, which so desperately wants jurisdiction of these particular items, can neither give any remedy or offer any relief to the parties that they ostensibly say they intend to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.163" offset="11338636">Now, there were some dissimilar factors between the Linn case and our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.038" offset="11366117">One, in that, in the Linn case, the NLRB does take recognition of libel and slander, at least to a limited degree, because it will consider those items in election cases and set aside elections if there has been misrepresentation with regard to libel and slander.</text>

            <text syncTime="3015.122" offset="12202453">There is one other item that I would like to reply to, and that is, this question about the union being the obligative representative of all of the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.629" offset="12268491">I would simply like to refer again to the contract, that the union, in secret, without the other employees, that theoretically, if that were true, they would be inclined to represent, sat down with the company, when the company had made a decision that it had made a bad choice, and made a contract which was detrimental to the 400 that it was in a fiduciary position and obligated to represent fairly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.160" offset="12394610">Now we contend that they are not, they are not the representatives, but that is fair statement of what position they were in, if that theory would be bought.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.765" offset="12433062">They were not the representatives, if they were the representatives, they did everything in their power to enter into a written contract which on page 10 of the brief of Belknap Inc., says that:</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.024" offset="12494084">"The company and the union further agree that in the event it is necessary that the company terminate replacement employees, in order to comply with this recall schedule, such terminations shall not be subject to grievance and arbitration provisions of the contract. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.718" offset="12560853">So they wrote the 400 out of the contract, and that is fair representation?</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.730" offset="12584886">I would think not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.966" offset="12589797">There are four cases which predominantly deal with torts that have come before this court: Linn v. United Plant Guard, Machinists v. Gonzales, Motor Coach Employees v. Lockridge, San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon, and Farmer v. United Brotherhood of Carpenters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.295" offset="12743188">In the Linn case upon which we rely, state court was allowed in that case to take jurisdiction of and adjudicate differences of a plant manager of an employer who sued for libel against the union, a tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.711" offset="12804837">In Machinists against Gonzales, Gonzales sued his own union, and the Court in that case said there was no infringement of any apparent wrong or any apparent deviation of the power of the National Labor Relations Board, because the state court had only to consider the elements of the union constitution and nothing to do with the strike, and he recovered in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.762" offset="12929075">In Motor Coach Employees versus Lockridge, a union member sued the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.992" offset="12957914">Relief was denied and overturned by this Court, with fair comment that had the state court been able to consider only the constitution of the union that it would have been a matter which they had jurisdiction of; however, they had to consider a security clause of a contract and had to rely upon that for adjudication, and the Court felt that that was arguably within the purview of the NLRB.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.835" offset="13105350">So Motor Coach Employees versus Lockridge favorably commented upon the right of Lockridge to sue, but denied his right to have it adjudicated by a state court, on the theory that in order to do so they would have to consider and comment and adjudicate a plant... a contract security clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.856" offset="13189359">In San Diego Building Trades Council versus Garmon, the holding of that Court extensively argued the theory of state court adjudication and decided that the state court could not award damages for peaceful picketing, a matter which was arguably within the purview and preempted by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.832" offset="13309314">In Farmer versus United Brotherhood of Carpenters, a union officer sued in tort for damages and the Court in that case favorably commented upon his right to sue in tort, however, reviewed the proof and decided that the proof called for the state court to rely upon apparent unemployment discrimination... I mean employment discrimination... and therefore, while the Court sanctioned the right of the state court to adjudicate pure tort, if in doing so the state court had to pass upon an employment discrimination matter they felt that that was arguably within the jurisdiction of and preempted by the NLRB.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.855" offset="13517353">I'm citing these because I think that these five cases graphically set forth what the Court's progress up to this time has been, and that in two of these cases state courts were allowed to adjudicate tort; in two other of these cases the state court... the ability of state court to do so was approved, however, the case was overturned because there was reliance on matters which was arguably under the preemption doctrine of the NLRB.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.324" offset="13687253">So I'm saying it is our position that tort has been allowed before, tort has been allowed under, for a better expression, thinner cases and circumstances than this; and that our only position is one which could probably be summed up by arguments that have been made by questions from this Court far better than I would ever have the ability to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.516" offset="13796027">But essentially we must, I feel, give some attention to simple propositions of law which I learned in law school, and that is, for every wrong there must be found a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.258" offset="13859034">State courts have never been preempted from adjudicating tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.179" offset="13878679">That is matters which were reserved to the state court by the Tenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.085" offset="13898323">Now, to the extent that the National Labor Relations Act may have carved out areas of that--</text>

            <text syncTime="3469.149" offset="14018590">And essentially all of the relief which these people are asking is, as simply put forth by the questions, it's no imposition upon a employer to go out and hire employees and tell them the reasonable, the satisfactory circumstances under which they will be employed, and that they may have to be terminated at such a time in the future, or to say nothing, for that matter; but not to overtly advertise something that it knows full well it cannot fulfil.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.635" offset="14152546">The depositions in the record in this case show that on February the 1st, at the time the strike began, and prior to that time there had been meetings with their attorneys and the plan to hire replacement employees had already been put into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.475" offset="14207926">The employer was present and in meeting with their attorneys when the language of the advertisement was put into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.064" offset="14246274">So it cannot be said that the employer was saying something he didn't know the consequences of.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.860" offset="14265395">The employer was well represented at that time, by one of the most prestigious law firms in the State of Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.716" offset="14300817">And that therefore, when you overtly go out of your way, when you also are planning to give a raise, when you most assuredly must have been advised that to do so is to create an unfair labor practice, and then to hire a complete set of employees knowing that you may not be able to fulfil those obligations, we submit is a matter which is not even arguably within the preemption area carved out by Congress.</text>
