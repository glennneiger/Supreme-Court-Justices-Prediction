            <text syncTime="6.456" offset="118172">This case is here from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.430" offset="141996">Texas law requires a school district to provide tuition free education for all children who are residents of the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.343" offset="181702">The law permits charging tuition to children whose presence in the district is for the primary purpose of attending the free public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.883" offset="223811">Petitioner is a custodian of a child, an American Citizen of Mexican parentage, who was living in the Texas school district primarily for the purpose of attending school there.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.276" offset="277414">The custodian brought this suit to challenge the Texas law on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.428" offset="302074">Both the District Court and the Court of Appeals upheld a law we now affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.839" offset="327674">A State may limit its free public school education to residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.334" offset="349617">Thus, a bona fide residence requirement neither offends the Equal Protection Clause nor burdens the constitutional right of interstate travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.797" offset="399459">Residents traditionally require physical presence and the present intention to remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.009" offset="428298">Therefore, Texas were justified in requiring more than a presence in the school district, where there presence was primarily to attend free public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.915" offset="475945">We decide only that the statute is valid on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.353" offset="493708">Justice Brennan filed a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.005" offset="504366">Justice Marshall has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
