            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="144047">We will hear arguments first this morning in Pickett against Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.243" offset="188978">Mr. Horne, you may proceed.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harold_w_horne" startTime="17.334" stopTime="297.529">
            <label>Mr. Harold W. Horne</label>
            <text syncTime="17.334" offset="213324">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.350" offset="229415">The issue in this case is whether Tennessee's two-year statute of limitations governing paternity and child support actions for illegitimate children violates the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.327" offset="281347">In Gomez v. Perez, this Court held that once a state posits a judicially enforceable right of children to support from their natural fathers, that the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the state from denying the same right to illegitimate children.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.837" offset="343309">Last year this Court, in the case of Mills v. Habluetzel considered Texas's response to Gomez and found that Texas's one year statute of limitations was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.176" offset="388658">In Mills the Court considered two criteria, the first being that any period for obtaining support must be sufficiently long in duration to present a reasonable opportunity for those with an interest in the child to assert the child's right to paternal support and second, that any period of limitation on that opportunity must be substantially related to the state's interest in avoiding the litigation of stale and fraudulent claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.583" offset="494297">This Court found that in the Mills case, the Mills statute, the one year statute of limitations failed on both criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.269" offset="517076">And the same reasoning which applied in Texas's case applies in Tennessee's, or to Tennessee's two-year statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.517" offset="550094">But in addition, in Tennessee, we have three additional factors which further the conclusion that Tennessee's two-year period of limitations is nothing less than invidious discrimination toward illegitimate children.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.574" offset="598264">The first is that in Tennessee's two-year statute of limitations the statute applies only to illegitimate children who are not receiving support from the state or who are not, in terms of the statute, a public charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.522" offset="646120">Thus, a two-year, nonwelfare, illegitimate child whose mother fails to file an action before the child reaches his second birthday will find his right to legitimation and to receive paternal support forever terminated, unless the child sometime in the future goes on welfare, receives AFDC or any other form of state assistance, and becomes a public charge, at which time the statute which purportedly had run, then terminates and the child can then, on behalf of any person, have an action filed, or any person can file the action on behalf of the child to seek the paternal support.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.303" offset="785196">Thus, the Tennessee legislature itself has considered that claims involving paternity and paternal support do not, in and of themselves, become stale prior to 18 years, or the reign of 18 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.141" offset="848517">The second item, and it comes out of a number of cases this Court has previously decided, this Court has held that involving the death of a father, that the claim of a state or the right of a state to legislate discriminatory treatment can be rationally related or substantially related to the state's interest in the orderly disposition of estates.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.022" offset="944125">However, in Tennessee, were the defendant Braxton Brown to die today, young Pickett could go into the Tennessee court and sue his father's estate and if he could meet the heightened standard of proof, being now more than preponderance of the evidence and less than beyond a reasonable doubt, that his father had, in fact, the defendant or the decedent was his father, he could proceed... could get a judgment and could be allowed to receive part of his father's estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.945" offset="1067737">Now if the issue in today's case were the right of young Pickett to proceed against a decedent's estate, I would have to agree with the Court that perhaps the claim could be stale and certainly would possess the potential for being fraudulent, yet again, the Tennessee legislature, or the Tennessee courts have decided that the mere death of the father, of the purported father, does not cause a claim to be stale or so possessed with the problems of being fraudulent as to terminate that cause or right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.059" offset="1192184">Third additional consideration is that in Tennessee the statute itself says that the purpose is to provide for the support, education and welfare of illegitimate children.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.789" offset="1239100">On the front end of Tennessee's statute, they again say that the fathers are responsible for the welfare and support of their illegitimate children.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.470" offset="1281836">Now obviously, one of the purposes of this statute is to prevent the likelihood that the illegitimate child will be placed upon the... or placed in need of support from the taxpayers of the state of Tennessee.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="297.529" offset="1334081">Mr. Horne, why did the mother wait so long in this case to bring her suit?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harold_w_horne" startTime="302.590" stopTime="346.600">
            <label>Mr. Harold W. Horne</label>
            <text syncTime="302.590" offset="1354352">You won't find it in the record, Your Honor, because I didn't come into this case until the statute of limitations issue has already been raised and we went straight from that issue to the Supreme Court, but in this case, Mrs. Pickett, when she became pregnant was so embarrassed, she told me, that she immediately left the town that she was living in, Memphis, moved down into Mississippi with her child to give birth in a community where nobody knew her and where she could hide her shame.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.595" offset="1454349">She told me that she filed this lawsuit when her child reached about nine years of age, he started saying well, who's my father and how come I don't have his name and why isn't his name on my birth certificate and it was at the request of her son that he be given an opportunity to have his father's name that she filed this lawsuit.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="346.600" stopTime="361.111">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="346.600" offset="1530418">Is it your position that no statute of limitations can be applied to an illegitimate child during the minority for establishment of paternity?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harold_w_horne" startTime="361.111" stopTime="388.099">
            <label>Mr. Harold W. Horne</label>
            <text syncTime="361.111" offset="1588409">Well, certainly in Tennessee I would agree that that is my position because of the other factors, but I would argue, likewise, that in any state irrespective of what factors were considered, that there is no logical reason for denying an illegitimate child the right to seek paternal support where the legitimate child is provided that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.574" offset="1662284">And I would go further and say, if a state were to say, well, legitimate children don't have the right to support from their fathers, I would find constitutional flaw with that argument as well.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="388.099" stopTime="403.565">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="388.099" offset="1696347">Well, Mr. Horne, what about a state which doesn't toll any statute during minority?</text>
            <text syncTime="393.941" offset="1719753">That is, the statute runs against minors, not just on legitimation claims, but on contract claims, tort claims and the like.</text>

          <turn speaker="harold_w_horne" startTime="403.565" stopTime="432.444">
            <label>Mr. Harold W. Horne</label>
            <text syncTime="403.565" offset="1758205">Well, I haven't given as much consideration to that possibility as I have in this case, but my initial reaction, Your Honor, is to say that any statute of limitations which affects a child's right to know his father, to have his father's name, the name on the birth certificate, and the right to receive support from both parents would be an unconstitutional deprivation of both equal protection... equal rights, rather and due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.711" offset="1862800">The reason, the only--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="432.444" stopTime="438.189">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="432.444" offset="1873771">It wouldn't be a equal protection violation, would it, if all causes of action of minors are treated the same?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harold_w_horne" startTime="438.189" stopTime="531.352">
            <label>Mr. Harold W. Horne</label>
            <text syncTime="438.189" offset="1896759">--I think it would, Your Honor, because in the context of paternity, and let me say I'd have more difficulty with it, it's something I haven't thought about in great depth, but in the context of child support, the only purpose for which a state can pass a limitations period on an illegitimate child's right to support would be the prevention of stale and fraudulent claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.319" offset="2001249">I think that was the position taken by both opinions in the Mill case.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.022" offset="2020057">And I see no potential for stale claims, or I don't see a child support claim becoming stale during the minority of the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.597" offset="2054434">It certainly doesn't become stale for a child that's presumed to have a father.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.764" offset="2075018">One way of looking at it is this, perhaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.806" offset="2087244">If a couple is married, and this happens all the time nowadays, they get a divorce and the father's trying to avoid his obligation of support, he disclaims the child and says this isn't my child anyway, even though it was born during the course of this marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.524" offset="2134055">He takes an HLA blood test.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.318" offset="2141265">The blood test comes back and says he's not the father.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.036" offset="2152132">He then has a right to avoid the child support obligation there.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.300" offset="2173239">The child is, in essence, bastardized by that process and if you have a period of limitations on the child's right to seek support from whoever his true father turns out to be, you've afforded a man a right to avoid supporting his illegitimate children without affording the illegitimate child an opportunity to locate his real father and seek support from the real father.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="531.352" offset="2269369">Well, that's not an equal protection claim, though, I wouldn't think.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.149" offset="2280550">Well, at any rate, does Tennessee have a general tolling statute for causes of action accruing to minors until they come of age?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harold_w_horne" startTime="543.395" stopTime="569.681">
            <label>Mr. Harold W. Horne</label>
            <text syncTime="543.395" offset="2317539">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.941" offset="2319734">Every action which a minor child has during his minority is tolled for the period of the minority plus the period of limitations after the child reaches minority so that, in Tennessee, this was going to get toward the end of my argument, but the only action which is terminated for the illegitimate child, or for any child rather, is the action of paternity or seeking paternal support.</text>

            <text syncTime="583.957" offset="2479812">There is a bill presently before the state legislature which I understand two weeks ago made it out of committee to the floor, but has not been passed yet, last I heard, which provides that the Department of Human Services in contested paternity cases, is to provide to defendants an HLA blood test, which would be paid for by the state initially, with cost to be allocated based upon the abilities of the parties to pay for it thereafter, and the results of the blood test would be made admissible in the court proceedings either to exclude paternity or to prove a probability of paternity.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harold W. Horne</label>
            <text syncTime="619.255" offset="2620978">It is admissible to disprove paternity.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.408" offset="2629650">It is not admissible to prove a likelihood or plausibility of paternity.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.470" offset="2645846">Now Tennessee's statue... two-year statute of limitations, which purportedly has for its purpose, the intent to prevent the child from becoming a public charge to the state, actually has the reverse effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.010" offset="2708018">A mother such as Miss Pickett, in this case, who finds that her cause of action is terminated by the two-year statute of limitations need only swallow her pride a little bit and go down to the welfare office and apply for state assistance to find that her child then has a right.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.320" offset="2761307">The state will then pay for the litigation, file a lawsuit and proceed for her child without a statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.237" offset="2780951">So the effect is to encourage women who find that the statute has already run to place their children on the welfare roles and seek additional support from the state, which is the opposite intent of the statue.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.342" offset="2825360">The intent of the statute is to see to it that fathers support their offspring.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.889" offset="2843541">The Tennessee Supreme Court's response to this was also somewhat surprising.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.569" offset="2878231">Relying upon an old New York case in the matter of Mores v. Feel, the legislature... Tennessee Supreme Court, relying upon their opinion, found that the legislature's only interest was to see to it that some one person supported an illegitimate child, as opposed to what the statute purportedly claims on the front end, that there is an intent that both parents should be equally responsible for the support of their illegitimate offspring.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.639" offset="2978542">This amounts to an open declaration and acknowledgment, I believe, of invidious discrimination flying in the face of Gomez.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.215" offset="3008844">Tennessee is saying, on the one hand, well, both parents are responsible for the support of their illegitimate children, but on the other hand, illegitimate children must be supported only by some one person, that's all we're really concerned about, and if that one person can't provide the support, then we'll set the statute of limitations aside and allow the state to proceed to litigate the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.317" offset="3093271">What Tennessee, in reality, is saying is that it's the woman's fault she became pregnant.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.688" offset="3110721">Let her take care of the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.969" offset="3119916">The man didn't have anything to do with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.201" offset="3124827">It's a blatant declaration of male supremacy and I believe it's a throwback to the days when state laws were made by male legislatures to and for the protection of male legislatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.525" offset="3170071">As I mentioned just a moment ago in response to your question, and the same as in the Texas case, Mills v. Habluetzel, in Tennessee this is the only cause of action which is not tolled for the minor illegitimate child.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.881" offset="3223570">Every other cause of action will be... the period of limitations will be tolled and the child will be allowed to proceed after it reaches its minority.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.877" offset="3259515">The only apparent answer then, I think, is that in child support cases is concerned, and we've got to ask that why is it only in child support cases that we have the statute not tolled in Tennessee and I believe the response is, it's the legislature's intention to visit society's condemnation for the illicit relationship outside the bonds of marriage upon the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.681" offset="3350734">It's a statement of policy that we do not approve of you fathering children, or mothering children outside the bonds of wedlock and lacking an ability, perhaps, to punish either of the parents, the legislature determined that it's the child that should bear the brunt of society's disapproval.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.267" offset="3425027">All considered, then, I argue that the two-year statute of limitations cannot be justified as being substantially related to the state's interest in preventing stale and fraudulent claims and, in fact, even under the reasonable relationship test, there is no reasonable relationship... or reasonable support for the argument that the two-year statute of limitations is going to prevent stale or fraudulent claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.552" offset="3534218">One last point is that in a number of this Court's opinions, I've noticed references to a state has a right to make some legislation to take care of the problems, the difficult problems of proof in paternity cases, I think that's the way it's referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.312" offset="3601196">I've, in the past five years, handled probably a little better than 2,500 paternity cases and I've failed to understand what the difficult problems in proof of paternity cases is really referring to.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.119" offset="3648426">In those cases where we're referring to the purported father having passed away, I acknowledge that there are some difficult problems of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.445" offset="3673817">The man ought to be given an opportunity to come in and defend himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.581" offset="3690326">But where the man is around, there is only two people that know whether relations occurred.</text>

            <text syncTime="2255.072" offset="9164233">As this Court has acknowledged this morning, the state also has an interest in limiting litigation, having litigation end at some point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.944" offset="9199760">And we believe that two years is a reasonable time within which litigation should end in paternity actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.082" offset="9220344">Also, the state has an interest in the welfare of its children and we believe that two years... within two years the relationship which can be established between the mother and the child is significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.779" offset="9271126">If paternity is established within two years, the mother is then afforded the financial assistance which she can gain from the father of the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.744" offset="9306966">Thus, the child is... gets the benefit of those financial advantages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.805" offset="9331208">In addition, the child is not forced to endure the emotional and psychological difficulties which are often associated with the illegitimate status.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.675" offset="9378646">We believe that two years is a reasonable time within which that relationship should be established and that that, in fact, is in the interests of the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.391" offset="9409575">I believe the Tennessee statute, based upon this Court's analysis in Mills, is reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.385" offset="9449490">In Mills, this Court stated that procedures by which illegitimate children are afforded in opportunity to obtain paternal support need not be coterminous with those afforded legitimate children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.426" offset="9501735">This Court held that limitations on paternity actions would be upheld as constitutional if they are sufficiently long in duration to afford persons with valid claims a reasonable opportunity to assert them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.687" offset="9554711">We believe that two years is a reasonable time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.342" offset="9569340">This Court addressed several concerns which were raised by the Texas one-year limitation which we believe are alleviated by the Tennessee two-year limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.650" offset="9622630">Within two years, a woman is likely to have sufficiently recovered from the physical and emotional difficulties associated with childbirth and be in a position where she can assess she and her child's situation reasonably and realistically.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.176" offset="9680726">Within two years after the birth of a child, a mother is not likely to endure the same financial difficulties which she may face within one year after the birth of the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.356" offset="9725448">It's not unreasonable to assume that within two years after the birth of the child the mother has returned to work and can afford to seek legal advice with respect to her responsibilities and obligations and those of the fathers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.961" offset="9779887">We also believe that two years is a reasonable time within which to require the establishment of the relationship of the father and the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.991" offset="9811965">I also believe that Tennessee's two-year limitation addresses the practical obstacles which were raised by this Court in the concurring opinion of Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.922" offset="9863688">These concerns included the emotional and psychological difficulties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.390" offset="9881556">As I've just stated, these are sufficiently alleviated by the two-year limitation and the financial difficulties which were raised by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.637" offset="9914574">We would also submit that the pressures from family and the community which may affect the mother's bringing an action within one year are sufficiently alleviated by Tennessee's statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.193" offset="9968805">I would submit that these pressures would bear more heavily upon a minor child than upon an adult.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.784" offset="10003182">Under Tennessee statute the two-year limitation is tolled for minor plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.732" offset="10030871">Thus she has two years after reaching her majority within which to bring those actions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2484.588" offset="10082385">I would submit that it is not so easy to go on welfare, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.241" offset="10100984">I believe that the record before this Court will show that the plaintiff has substantial assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.194" offset="10128778">She owns property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.598" offset="10134421">I believe that she earns approximately $1,000 a month.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.924" offset="10147691">It would be very difficult for her to qualify under the welfare laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.609" offset="10170470">We would also submit that the scheme of our welfare benefits... the scheme of our welfare system is such that we could easily detect any fraud which may be perpetuated or encouraged by these actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.589" offset="10226372">In summary, I would just like to state that we believe the Tennessee statute affords a reasonable opportunity within which persons with valid claims may assert them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.756" offset="10283005">Further, that the two-year limitation is substantially related to several legitimate state interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.269" offset="10309023">These include the state's interest in avoiding stale and fraudulent claims; the state's interest in repose; and the state's interest in the welfare of the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.655" offset="10346640">The practical obstacles to bringing an action which were applicable to the Texas statute are not present under Tennessee statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.668" offset="10386659">We would submit that this Court should affirm the decision of the Supreme Court of Tennessee.</text>
