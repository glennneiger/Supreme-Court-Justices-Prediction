            <label>Mr. Thomas M. Genovese</label>
            <text syncTime="61.410" offset="392029">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="63.394" offset="399970">This case involves construction of Section 4F(b) of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act of 1976 and Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.936" offset="438214">We believe there are two inter-related questions:</text>
            <text syncTime="75.249" offset="447409">First, whether the investigative files or other materials of the United States Attorney General also includes materials covered or encompassed by Rule 6(e);--</text>
            <text syncTime="84.448" offset="484189">And second, if so, what is the discretionary standard to be followed by a district court in determining whether to release materials covered by Rule 6(e) pursuant to request by a state attorney general under Section 4F(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="98.615" offset="540927">Very briefly with respect to the facts, in the late 1970's the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice conducted a complex and lengthy investigation of the piping and sheet metal industries in Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.187" offset="599128">That investigation focused on conspiracies among competitors in those industries to rig bids on public projects, mostly school projects in the Chicago area.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.387" offset="643954">After the State of Illinois had received notice under Section 4F(a) that it had a potential cause of action, it made a request to the United States Attorney General for all relevant investigative files or other materials under Section 4F(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="139.568" offset="704662">In response at that time, we were provided with 19 pages of preliminary memoranda generated long before the grand jury had been transferred to the Northern District of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.094" offset="750847">Everything else, we were informed, was covered by Rule 6(e), and that the Government would support our request for a court order releasing the materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.447" offset="792225">Subsequently the State of Illinois and the Chicago Board of Education filed two class action treble damage lawsuits on behalf of the public entities in the area seeking to recover the overcharges suffered by those entities as a result of the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.520" offset="852516">The criminal actions have long ago terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.739" offset="869338">The civil cases are still proceeding with discovery, and in that regard a few of the transcripts in one of the cases may be disclosed to us pursuant to Rule 6(e) because those transcripts were previously disclosed to the Defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.247" offset="939451">Turning to the first question, I believe it takes great liberties with the very broad expansive language of that statute to conclude that information relating to matters or occurrences before an investigative grand jury is somehow not contained in a prosecutor's files or other materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.348" offset="1023774">We believe the statute plainly includes all materials compiled by an Assistant United States Attorney General to prepare and prosecute his case.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="230.138" offset="1066929">Suppose the Attorney General came back and said, we don't have a transcript of the... what happened before the grand jury any more.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.325" offset="1103709">Maybe we had it once, but we don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.416" offset="1116039">But we'll be glad to... to support your request before the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.976" offset="1142370">Do you think the standard then when you went to the judge would be Rule 6(e) or would you say, the statute has made this material available to us on a lesser showing?</text>

            <text syncTime="1206.430" offset="4972130">Section 4F(b) of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act embodies a Congressional determination that, in order to promote state-sponsored litigation as a vital aspect of national antitrust enforcement policy, the United States Attorney General should to the full extent permitted by law disclose to the states any investigative files or other materials that are or may be relevant or material to a potential state antitrust enforcement action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.639" offset="5084979">Notwithstanding this evident policy, evident Congressional policy of disclosure, the court below declined to allow the State of Illinois access to 5500 pages of grand jury transcripts that are relevant to two class action lawsuits filed by the state under Sections 4 and 5 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.428" offset="5156137">It did so based on two propositions:</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.115" offset="5166899">First, it doubted whether Section 4F(b) included grand jury materials in the possession of the Attorney General; and second, it concluded that the statute had no impact on its balancing test under Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure as to whether it should allow those materials to be used in another judicial proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="2131.908" offset="8674099">If I can begin by addressing myself to Mr. Justice Stevens' question concerning particularized need, and Mr. Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.728" offset="8725299">I understood the state attorney general to state in the beginning that he had recently filed with Judge Layton in the district court a request, according to particularized need, for some of the transcripts of some of the witnesses having appeared before the grand jury, and that he told him at that time that some of the Defendants had possession of those transcripts already.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.079" offset="8826759">So it seems to me that an important consideration here is the fact that there is no evidence in this record and there is nothing in the legislative history to indicate that the particularized need test or so-called particularized need test is frustrating the antitrust enforcement that Congress has mandated in the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, or that indeed the law enforcement efforts of any county or state are somehow being frustrated by that test.</text>

            <text syncTime="2352.316" offset="9555680">In the context of the argument that was presented here, it is assumed that under 4F(b) that the request will not be made until after the criminal proceeding and after the investigation is completed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2752.136" offset="11155000">During the course of the debate in the Senate there was, in the words of one commentator, "fierce opposition" to the possibility that grand jury materials would be disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.754" offset="11205469">That opposition consisted of Senators Laxalt, Tower, Allen, Hruska and others, and they voiced strong objection to the question of availability of grand jury material, not to whom it was going to be disclosed but to the fact it was going to be disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.919" offset="11286135">Senator Allen went so far as to introduce an amendment to the Senate version of the bill that included 4F(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.430" offset="11324169">That was defeated, but the fact that he went to that effort to introduce into the Senate 4F(b) and was an objector, a strong objector, to the disclosure of grand jury materials shows that Congress was aware of the distinction between investigative files generally and grand jury materials specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.136" offset="11434929">The question really, in dealing with any change, gets down to the importance and the significance of the grand jury as a body.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.571" offset="11484666">This Court when it changed Rule 16 in 1966, the Congress when it enacted Section 3500, dealt with that concept directly and specifically, and that was a recognition of what the grand jury is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.047" offset="11558645">In the staff interview that the Antitrust Department lawyer might have with a potential witness, he's probably represented by counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="2865.994" offset="11610367">In the grand jury he's in a secret room, literally, with 24 or 25 strangers, without a lawyer... an intimidating sight at best.</text>

            <text syncTime="3069.052" offset="12422671">They said they gave them everything.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.632" offset="12428940">The fact is that after Respondents' brief was filed, that at least two or three more pages, according to the State of Illinois' reply brief, were made available to them in September of this year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.143" offset="12475020">But there's no... our system of justice is based on an adversary system, and I don't think that between the State of Illinois and the Government of the United States you have this adversary flavor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.277" offset="12535520">I know there was a question earlier, but truthfully, according to the manual... and I don't know who looked at that beforehand amongst the State of Illinois lawyers... there were some materials that the Government says in the manual they retain the discretion to give or not to give.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.613" offset="12608871">It seems to me that the State of Illinois should pursue that before saying to this Court, you should include grand jury materials in this general phrase because we only got 19 pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.123" offset="12654951">I think that the important point to be made when you get down to the nitty-gritty, as they say, is there is a distinction between grand jury materials and other materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.319" offset="12719735">There is a distinction and there is a uniqueness about the grand jury system and the institution of the grand jury, and when Congress or this Court have dealt with that question they have dealt with it specifically, not by implication.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.705" offset="12785250">The State of Illinois and the Government would have this Court believe that merely because the Congress passed legislation which was directed at antitrust violators and authorized the filing of parens patriae actions which had previously not been allowed, that that was an indication that 6(e) was to be changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.710" offset="12873231">When you get to the question of changing 6(e), you get to all sorts of other questions which 4F does not address itself to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.957" offset="12906249">There is nothing in 4F to indicate a Congressional dissatisfaction with the way that the court's discretion is working.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.550" offset="12936656">There is nothing in 4F to determine that the courts in determining the amount of disclosure, the time of disclosure, and the conditions of disclosure, as the rule enunciates, is somehow inadequate or is somehow frustrating the antitrust efforts of the State of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.931" offset="13010112">And this Court should not adopt that position, that Congress by implication, without any reference to grand jury at all, changed the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3228.660" offset="13061103">Senator Abourezk's comment stating that materials could not be turned over absent a court order, that the only materials that could be turned over under 4F(b) were those that had been provided the Government voluntarily... those are his words.</text>

            <text syncTime="3276.203" offset="13251275">Congress wanted the states to have valuable information prior to the institution of a lawsuit, because Congress understood that in order to have local and national antitrust enforcement it was essential that the states, and because the states lacked the resources, it was essential the states have this information in order to bring these kinds of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.928" offset="13334135">Respondents' interpretation I think creates a kind of inverse relationship between need and disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.785" offset="13357541">The more significant and valuable the information in the Government's file, under the Respondents' interpretation, the less likely that it could ever be produced to a state attorney general.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.657" offset="13401009">And the reason for that is that it is only the significant and valuable information which is presented to an investigative grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.437" offset="13432147">What is left is uninformative, whether it's 19 pages or however many, and it could also be misleading and grossly inaccurate to a state attorney general who has to make a decision of whether he's going to undertake the resource drain of filing these kinds of actions in accordance with Congress' intent.</text>
