            <text syncTime="6.236" offset="117158">The first of these is Marshall against Lonberger which comes here on a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.718" offset="147146">A vast majority of the criminal trials in our country occur in state courts and some limited situations a person convicted of a state crime by a state court may request a federal court issue a writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.499" offset="198242">This writ which orders the release of the person from imprisonment can be obtained only when the prisoner's right under the United States Constitution had been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.256" offset="229275">The power of federal habeas courts to release a prisoner subject the requirement that a federal habeas court give a high measure of deference to the factual conclusions of the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.693" offset="266996">In this case, an Ohio jury convicted Robert Lonberger of a brutal murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.292" offset="285386">Many years after his trial in state court, Lonberger asked the federal court to issue a writ of habeas corpus ordering his release from prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.507" offset="314225">His argument rested on the claim that the prosecution introduced evidence at his murder trial relating to a plea of guilty in 1972 to a charge of murder -- attempted murder in Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.572" offset="358529">Lonberger claimed that his conviction for attempted murder based on his guilty plea was invalid because he really intended to plead guilty to the charge of attempted murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.816" offset="395518">Although the Ohio state courts have rejected Lonberger's argument, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit accepted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.065" offset="420491">In order to do so, however, it had to reject at least one of the implied factual findings of the Ohio courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.834" offset="447554">The Ohio trial court decided that Lonberger was not being completely truthful in claiming that he had not meant to plead guilty to attempted murder in 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.002" offset="484230">The federal court even though it had never observed Lonberger disagreed with the state court and chose to believe his testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.028" offset="508367">Where a factual question such as whether a particular person is telling the truth is involved, federal habeas courts must accept the findings of state courts unless they are not fairly supportable.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.395" offset="545775">Because the Court of Appeals did not observe this rule, we reverse its judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.070" offset="564478">Justice Brennan has filed a dissenting opinion joined by Justice Marshall.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.827" offset="579525">Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion joined by Justices Brennan, Marshall and Blackmun.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.955" offset="600109">Justice Blackmun has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
