            <label>Mr. Warner W. Gardner</label>
            <text syncTime="92.598" offset="508975">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="96.333" offset="523917">This case involves the crash of a C-5A aircraft which was delivered to the Air Force by Lockheed in September of 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.199" offset="591417">In March of 1975 the plane was stationed at the Travis Air Force Base in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.131" offset="639169">On March the 16th it was cannibalized and two tie rods were removed for the benefit of another plane.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.079" offset="686921">Eight days later the tie rods... other tie rods were replaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.155" offset="711267">At the time the rigging of the lock which held the aft cargo ramp was not fully rigged.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.074" offset="754944">On April the 1st the plane left Travis, went to Georgia where it picked up 50 tones of howitzers.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.772" offset="801651">From there it went to Saigon with some trans-Pacific way stops and arrived at noon on April the 5th, 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.252" offset="855567">That was one or two days before the final fall of Saigon.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.313" offset="879914">Within a space of three hours the howitzers were unloaded and 301 passengers somehow put aboard the plane, most of whom were Vietnamese orphans.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.275" offset="939682">Shortly after takeoff the locking mechanism on the door to the aft cargo ramp gave way.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.098" offset="978970">The ramp fell, severing the control lines of the plane.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.456" offset="1000390">In an unsuccessful effort to regain the Saigon airport it crashed with heavy loss of life and injury to almost all of those who survived.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.560" offset="1048874">Several hundred product liability suits were filed against Lockheed.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.043" offset="1078758">They were consolidated by the Multidistrict Panel in the District of Columbia courts here.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.898" offset="1106239">In each case Lockheed joined the Unites States as third party defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.647" offset="1137167">After extensive discovery, the United States and Lockheed produced an agreed statement of material facts and further agreed between themselves upon a percentage division of any recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.306" offset="1231835">That last agreement reserved, however, the rights of the United States under the so-called exclusive liability provisions of the Federal Employees' Compensation Act in respect of civilian government employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.673" offset="1309262">There were about 33 suits filed involving civilian government employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.249" offset="1335594">This is the lead case.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.171" offset="1343326">The case was filed by Mr. Thomas as administrator of the estate of a deceased civilian government employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.464" offset="1396511">He was paid an award under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act and brought suit against Lockheed on product liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.271" offset="1443741">That suit has been settled with the agreement of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.300" offset="1459832">There remains open only the claim of the United States to immunity or absence of liability because of the provisions of Section 8116(c) of Title V.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.338" offset="1536005">That exclusive liability provision is printed at page 2 of the blue brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.864" offset="1582085">The Government insists that its plain words provide that the Government should be liable to no one in respect of an employee covered by the Employees' Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.593" offset="1648959">We would be inclined to agree with the Government if the statute stopped at the fifth line as we have printed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.261" offset="1687620">It would then read:</text>
            <text syncTime="389.683" offset="1697337">"The liability of the United States or an instrumentality under this subchapter with respect to the injury or death of an employee is exclusive and instead of all other liability of the United States or the instrumentality. "</text>
            <text syncTime="413.624" offset="1793154">If there came at that point a period, as I have indicated, we think the Government would be right.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.607" offset="1825024">Instead, the statute goes on for another eight lines, all of which would seem to be surplussage in the Government reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.727" offset="1865566">Moreover, those eight lines themselves contain a second, inexplicable redundancy under the Government's reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.768" offset="1913631">If suit is barred by all persons, why ever did the Congress enumerate the employee, his legal representative, spouse, dependents, next of kin?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="466.479" offset="2004537">Well, Mr. Gardner, isn't that a fairly rational drafting of a sentence that starts with the noun "liability" and then is talking about the liability... what liability, the liability to, and then starting in the sixth line, to the employee, his legal representative--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warner_w_gardner" startTime="483.051" stopTime="607.110">
            <label>Mr. Warner W. Gardner</label>
            <text syncTime="483.051" offset="2070784">Yes, sir, I think it's an entirely rational statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.016" offset="2078725">I think this has three times been so read by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.018" offset="2094712">It is barring the liability of the employee and those who claim through the employee because of the injury or death.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.654" offset="2141210">The Government in its reading would exclude the limiting clauses which I have summarized as saying those who claim through the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.414" offset="2192305">In the Government's reading all they need is to bar liability with respect to the death to any person, period.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.207" offset="2235460">If, as I insist, this is surplussage, it is important to note that it did not arise because of hasty drafting on the floor just prior to enactment of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.306" offset="2315812">It has deliberately been enacted by four legislatures, all using virtually identical words: the New York Legislature in 1922 when it passed its Workmen's Compensation Act; the Federal Longshoremen and Harbor Workers' Act of 1927 when they copied virtually intact the words from the New York statute; the Congress again in 1949 when this act was passed; and again in 1966 when Title V was codified.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.164" offset="2479234">I would think the government should have some explanation for what by its reading must be a pervasive and persistent addiction to surplussage over a period of 60 years by four legislatures.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="607.110" stopTime="611.887">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="607.110" offset="2567006">--Well, as you read the statute I take it you don't find any of that surplussage.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warner_w_gardner" startTime="611.887" stopTime="612.792">
            <label>Mr. Warner W. Gardner</label>

            <text syncTime="618.809" offset="2613817">"any other person otherwise entitled to recover damages from the United States. "</text>
            <text syncTime="623.165" offset="2631267">that appears in, I think, the seventh and eighth lines, would you say that covered an individual or corporation like Lockheed in this case?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warner_w_gardner" startTime="631.132" stopTime="631.943">

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warner_w_gardner" startTime="632.832" stopTime="1193.557">
            <label>Mr. Warner W. Gardner</label>
            <text syncTime="632.832" offset="2669928">I would say that under the very familiar principles of ejusdem generis that coverall phrase is intended to refer to others of the same class.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.891" offset="2722173">For example, the draftsmen in looking to those who might be claiming through the employee could not know what varieties of persons under one state law or another would have that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.821" offset="2785912">For one of many examples one can take the guardian ad lidem for a minor dependent.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.145" offset="2823215">Obviously, to be safe you would want a coverall clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.707" offset="2841396">This Court has three times approached this language with consistent results, a consistency not shown by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.276" offset="2915688">In the Ryan case, Ryan against Pan-Atlantic Steamship Company in the 350th United States, the Court quoted these provisions in their almost identical form as they appeared in the Longshoremen and Harbor Workers' Act and said:</text>
            <text syncTime="716.001" offset="3002624">"The obvious purpose of this provision is to make the employer's compensation liability exclusive to anyone claiming under or through such employee. "</text>
            <text syncTime="734.231" offset="3075558">--that limiting phrase was repeated twice at page 129 of the 350th United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.677" offset="3109308">That interpretation was adopted at the urging of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.068" offset="3126862">Seven years later this Court considered Weyerhaeuser Steamship Company against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.236" offset="3163538">This time the words were those in this statute, the Federal Employees' Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.483" offset="3196557">Mr. Justice Stewart, writing for a unanimous Court, turned to these words and said that the Government's contention as to their plain meaning was not at all plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.084" offset="3270954">This time the Government was containing... contending that plainly the provision barred any third party claim over.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.504" offset="3312645">He referred to the principle of ejusdem generis in reaching that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.047" offset="3338767">He went on to examine the legislative history, and he found that that history was clear, that the remedy of the Compensation Act was made exclusive for the government employees and their representatives or dependents, and that there was no evidence, I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="823.178" offset="3431345">"no evidence whatever that Congress was concerned with the rights of unrelated third parties. "</text>
            <text syncTime="831.988" offset="3466559">Again this Court in Federal Marine Terminals against Burnside Terminal... Burnside Shipping Company six years later in the 394th United States similarly... similarly read the provisions as stating that there was no quid pro quo for third persons, and the statute was not to be thought to extend to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.628" offset="3629145">Quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="873.314" offset="3631861">"On the contrary, as emphasized in Ryan, the Act is concerned only with the rights and obligations as between the stevedore... stevedoring contractor and the employee or his representative. "</text>
            <text syncTime="892.929" offset="3710333">If the Court will forgive me, I will need a bit of water before I attack long words.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.115" offset="3751084">We see no occasion to retrace the legislative history which was covered in Justice Stewart's opinion in the Weyerhaeuser case.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.687" offset="3809390">We have printed the committee reports which are the sole explanation of these exclusive liability provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.041" offset="3846797">We do note, however, that in that statute, statutory history, the Court said that the statute was drawn from the Longshoremen Workers... Longshoremen and Harbor Workers' Act and from the New York statute in 1922.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.688" offset="3933314">In 1938, 11 years before this enactment, the New York Court of Appeals had decided the Westchester Lighting case.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.404" offset="3984201">There an employee of the development company was asphyxiated when another employee broke the gas main of the lighting company.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.054" offset="4034879">The employee received an award, then obtained a judgment against the lighting company which claimed over for tort indemnity against the development company.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.390" offset="4108126">The Court of Appeals allowed the claim, stating that the lighting company sued for its own injury and not for the injury to the deceased employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.648" offset="4169252">By 1949 when this statute was enacted, the New York rule had become firmly established.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.771" offset="4201644">It had been applied in a number of the lower New York cases once again by the Court of Appeals of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.300" offset="4235812">The lower Federal courts addressing the same words in the Longshoremen's Act had by a large majority allowed the claim, typically in reliance upon the Westchester reasoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.433" offset="4296312">The Government has not seen fit to address the impact of the New York rule upon this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.864" offset="4358065">If it did, so far as I could tell it would be forced to urge upon this Court that neither the members of Congress nor the Congressional committees or the staff or the committees or the lawyers at the Federal Security Agency, which drafted this statute by copying the provisions of the New York statute, had any idea how the New York statute had been interpreted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.930" offset="4482304">It seems to us most improbable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.711" offset="4493484">I'd like to return for a moment to the merits of the Weyerhaeuser case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.411" offset="4520234">There an Army dredge collided with the Weyerhaeuser liner off the coast of Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.095" offset="4555029">A civilian government employee was aboard the dredge, and after receiving award under the Compensation Act brought suit against Weyerhaeuser and received a judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.965" offset="4622425">The Admiralty Court found both vessels at fault and divided damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.195" offset="4647398">Weyerhaeuser presented in its bill the payment made to the government employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.332" offset="4675923">This Court sustained Weyerhaeuser's position unanimously.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.207" offset="4703404">I find no way to distinguish in terms of Section 8116(c) the admiralty claim for damages and the tort indemnity claim for restitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.104" offset="4779055">The Government's principal distinction as I read their discussion is that Weyerhaeuser dealt with an admiralty rule, that of divided damages, of ancient vintage and well established.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.299" offset="4859825">Well, so, too, tort indemnity is a remedy long established, found in decisions of this Court for more than a century past.</text>

            <text syncTime="1217.251" offset="5007574">It is to my mind something that deserves a great deal of comment, all of which should be adverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.264" offset="5031711">Nothing in Section 8116(c) draws any distinction between admiralty and law, between divided damages and tort indemnity, nor indeed any distinction between the government employee who travels on an Army dredge in contrast to the one who travels on an Air Force plane.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.830" offset="5149889">I come now to the independent duty basis of the decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.264" offset="5175698">The court's opinion seems to me to have been a quite remarkable one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.321" offset="5199940">It dutifully quoted the words of Section 8116(c) and never again referred to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.398" offset="5236198">It made no reference to the legislative history of the provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.239" offset="5259603">It paid no attention to the New York rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.812" offset="5281860">It made no meaningful citation of the Weyerhaeuser case and none at all of the Ryan case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.841" offset="5313938">Instead, it said that for Lockheed to recover it must show an independent duty, independent, that is, of the claim of the employee, and that Lockheed had not shown a duty which was so independent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.177" offset="5395336">In my view the term "independent duty" does nothing but to generate what might be called a metaphysical fog which obscures the true issue in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.500" offset="5452596">The true issue must necessarily be what did the legislature enact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.529" offset="5476733">The term is, moreover, inevitably and inherently question-begging.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.791" offset="5501811">Every third party claim will necessarily involve the death or the injury of the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.806" offset="5541830">That necessary ingredient to the action is in the but-for sense a cause of the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.160" offset="5571296">The observe side of this elusive coin is that every third party claim also involve another ingredient: the injury to the third party inflicted when it is required to respond in judgment because of the negligence of the Government or the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.104" offset="5663039">I know of no way in which these interrelated duties could be said to be either independent or to be derivative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.710" offset="5697416">That's not entirely accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.536" offset="5704730">I know one way, which is to look to the judgment and then go back and describe the duty as independent or as derivative according to the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.204" offset="5747466">The last thought which I would like to present to the Court relates to the policies which the Congress has uniformly followed in these exclusive liability provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.557" offset="5808802">It has never curtailed a right or a remedy without offering a compensating benefit called sometimes in the committee reports a quid pro quo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.365" offset="5864077">Thus, the employee, who is forbidden to bring suit against the Government in search of a jury verdict, is given a fast, fault-free, prompt award, which at least in the years close to the enactment of the provision is a generous one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.122" offset="5947146">The Government, stripped of its customary defenses, or the stevedoring employer in the other act of contributory negligence, assumption of risk and so on, gains a ceiling, a definite, assured limit to its liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.300" offset="6043799">In 1972 the Congress amended the Longshoremen's Act in two respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.014" offset="6078699">First, it eliminated the liability without fault of the vessel based on the unseaworthiness doctrine to the longshoremen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.760" offset="6125615">Having done that, and only because it did that, it went on to eliminate the claim over by the vessel against the stevedore on the ground that if the vessel was now liable only for its own negligence, there was no occasion to limit the claim over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.032" offset="6210774">The Government here asks the Court to do to the same words in this statute what the Congress was required to do to the same words in the Longshoremen's Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.368" offset="6272110">It asks, moreover, that this Court act without the sensitivity to the equities of the third person held liable without fault which the Congress betrayed in the 1972 amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.536" offset="6336789">We suggest that the Government's request that you usurp the power to the Congress exercises more harshly than the Congress would should be denied.</text>

            <text syncTime="1698.177" offset="6931336">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.269" offset="6963727">The section that is at issue in this case is a portion of a major workers' compensation program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.218" offset="6991522">It was enacted by Congress in 1916, and it covers virtually all Federal civilian employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.200" offset="7023391">Under the program, an employee who is injured on the job receives compensation, and that compensation occurs promptly, it occurs without regard to the fault of either the employer or the employee, and it occurs without litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.050" offset="7098833">It is an administrative scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.019" offset="7106670">Thus, in the present case the Federal employee, Ann Nash Bottorff, was aboard the C-5A when it crashed and who died in that crash, had survivors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.295" offset="7155780">Those survivors applied for death benefits under the Federal Employees Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.152" offset="7179185">It was concluded that Ms. Bottorff was in the course of her duties at the time of the crash, and the survivors received death benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.636" offset="7209174">Benefits are paid out of the Employees' Compensation Fund within the Treasury Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.255" offset="7239581">Benefits paid out at the present time are running around $1 billion per year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.861" offset="7266016">Payments to the employees under the Federal Employees' Compensation program essentially take the place of tort damages that an employee might otherwise be entitled to recover.</text>

            <text syncTime="1807.290" offset="7367790">The Government has entered into agreements with Petitioner under which, as Petitioner's counsel indicated, there will be payment of a portion of the settlement liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.238" offset="7415541">The payment of the compensation to the Federal employees who were a part of the group that died in the C-5A crash, as I said, takes the place of tort damages, and in essence what that creates is a ceiling for the Federal agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.994" offset="7510627">The agency can look to a ceiling that allows it to avoid the uncertainty of potential tort damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.472" offset="7544482">In addition, the agency can avoid the constant litigation that would arise if work-related injuries were always settled in the courts under the tort system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.827" offset="7589935">Now, this creates what has been referred to as a limited liability feature: a limit on the liability of the employer, in this case the federal agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.574" offset="7640926">This is something that Congress was particularly concerned about in 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.961" offset="7658480">The legislative history does show that Congress was quite concerned about complaints from federal agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.850" offset="7690036">The agencies had found that they were facing suits by... facing suits concerning these work-related accidents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.503" offset="7724622">They saw that they were being opened to potential tort liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.078" offset="7742908">They saw that they were facing litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.652" offset="7761194">They would be forced to expend time and resources on this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.153" offset="7779270">Congress did mention frequently in the legislative history... and we've cited some of the portions in our brief on page 36... Congress expected that by enacting Section 8116(c) there would be an end to this sort of litigation; that agencies would be free to proceed with their business, that they would not be tied up in litigation, and that there would be savings that could in turn by applied as compensation for the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.794" offset="7893791">Virtually all workers' compensation programs include this sort of limited liability feature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.964" offset="7926496">And this Court on several occasions has acknowledged in the context of other compensation statutes that the limited liability feature creates a protective mantle for the employer, the federal agency in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.302" offset="7991803">Under the Longshoremen's statute this Court stated in Cooper Stevedoring that there was a protective mantle created by limited liability and that that mantle extended to third party claims against the employer which had arisen out of the claim of the employee against the third party based on the work-related injury.</text>

            <text syncTime="2025.651" offset="8241220">The indication under the state laws governing private employers is that the employer is immune from this sort of third party suit; that in addition to the liability, limited liability vis-a-vis the employee or any dependents or whatever, in addition, any sort of third part suit of the sort that Petitioner is urging here also is barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.109" offset="8339022">Now, Petitioner's counsel raised the New York law and suggested that we had not addressed the New York law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.310" offset="8363891">I believe we've indicated at least at one point in our brief that there is some question as to what the New York law in fact was at the time of passage in 1949 of this section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.773" offset="8413732">I think it's important to note that both the House and Senate reports on this legislation do not refer to the New York law; rather, the language that Congress used was state workmen's compensation laws in general have this sort of provision, referring to the exclusive liability provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.701" offset="8497429">There is some mention of New York laws... Petitioner has referred to it in its brief... but that mention is in the hearings, and it is in the context of mentioning that this legislation is based on the Longshoremen's statute, the New York statute and other workers' compensation statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2115.864" offset="8602023">This is in 1949 when Congress was looking at this problem that the Federal agencies had brought up to it, and there was realization that in fact there were models for this sort of provision around, that states had it, that the Longshoremen's statute had it, and in fact that this was something that might fit the bill for the Federal agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.887" offset="8682167">Now, I suggest that New York was one among many and that if there was any model, perhaps it was the Longshoremen's statute, which as this Court has observed is very close to the language here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.506" offset="8732635">The New York situation in 1949 was simply not that clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.178" offset="8751339">Petitioner's counsel has referred to the Westchester Lighting case in 1938.</text>

            <text syncTime="2784.980" offset="11278529">Ryan very specifically turned on the implied contractual indemnity that the Court found in that case and that the Government urged on the Court to find; that really the focus was is there something other than tort liability here; can we look to the relationship between the parties in Ryan and find a service relationship, a contract to perform a duty and to perform it well, and can we read into that some sort of obligation to indemnify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.575" offset="11408932">The Court concluded in that case that yes, it could, and it specifically stated that it did not address the problem that Petitioner presents; that of this noncontractual indemnity, the purely tort-based indemnity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.852" offset="11465984">I think that this Court and the lower courts looking to this Court's decisions have been rather careful to distinguish that sort of contract, whether it be express or implied, from the kind of pure joint tortfeaser situation that we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.486" offset="11528573">Now, I don't know exactly why Congress chose the particular enumerations it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.216" offset="11555427">It may well have been that the thought was to give some notice to individuals that would be affected by this act to be sure everybody understood just who was excluded.</text>

            <text syncTime="2922.750" offset="11829608">You don't have Congress giving any indication that its expectations about the savings of money to government, and particularly the savings in litigation having to be in court all the time over these thousands of work-related accidents, you don't find any indication that Congress thought sometimes this will be the case and sometimes not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.413" offset="11912260">Rather, the statements were we believe this is going to keep the agencies out of the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.613" offset="11937024">So I think you have to read the statutory language in light of that expectation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.096" offset="11958967">You have to read it in light of the expectation that under a compensation scheme the limited liability feature is going to be an effective one; that it ought not be circumvented, as the Court has suggested, by the third party claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.043" offset="12018735">If it were, you would have the anomaly under which the mere fortuity of the involvement of a third party in an accident would break down the limited liability feature; that is, if you had the Government as the only party and individual tortfeaser that was one hundred percent negligent, under Congress' statute the Government... the Government's liability is confined to its compensation payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.877" offset="12130121">However, if somehow you have a third party that comes into the picture, then suddenly that breaks down.</text>

            <text syncTime="3291.304" offset="13303855">The compensation systems have been around for a long time, and I think that Petitioner is well aware of them in the state context; in fact, probably takes advantage of this limited liability in the states where it is an employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.142" offset="13363205">Petitioner is an experienced government contractor and is used to dealing with the government; in fact, could have anticipated that in this case the likeliest thing that could have happened would be the C-5A going down with a full complement of troops, military personnel; and under Stencel Aero this Court has said that there would be simply no chance of a third party claim in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.242" offset="13455574">So I think that Petitioner is complaining largely about the fact that the tort system allows a plaintiff to recover against single tortfeaser and sometimes another is not available to help share.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.563" offset="13508864">And this is the sort of thing that can be foreseen and planned against, particularly by someone in Petitioner's situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.264" offset="13539688">In sum, we urge that this Court protect the limited liability feature that we think Congress fully intended in 1949 to make clear to codify and incorporate into the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.395" offset="13608234">Petitioner's interpretation, we urge, is one that would break down that limited liability feature and would be contrary to the sort of scheme that Congress set up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.707" offset="13645432">We urge the Court to reject that interpretation and to maintain what we believe to be the intent of Congress ever since 1949.</text>

            <text syncTime="3499.577" offset="14136952">I think the New York statute, explicitly adopted by the Congress and firmly interpreted by 1949... the criticisms of the New York rule are those of the Second Circuit after 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.650" offset="14201213">At the time this statute was adopted there was not question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.287" offset="14219708">The tortfeaser point, whether or not we are claiming something like contribution, I think can be put aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.535" offset="14260772">As Justice Stevens explained in the Northwest Airlines case, tort indemnity is like the ancient chancery remedy coming into play when there is an inadequacy of the legal remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.763" offset="14321690">And it could well be in that one state or another there would be difficulties with a joint tortfeaser contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.898" offset="14370173">But the principle of restitution which underlies tort indemnity now, as in the 13th and 14th centuries, is expected to fill the need.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.924" offset="14418343">That was discussed very thoroughly in the New York and the Illinois cases which we've cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.374" offset="14444152">One last thought on the Stencel case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.183" offset="14471319">The Government naturally seizes upon one of the three factors which the Court in the aggregate found sufficient to bar recovery over by the contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.380" offset="14528162">Those three factors were the preeminence of the Federal interest and the undesirability of subjecting it to state law in the conduct of military operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.768" offset="14577690">The second factor was the compensation system which was in effect for the serviceman.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.061" offset="14606843">The third fact is the overwhelming factor, in my view, is the fact you can neither discipline troops nor conduct wars in terms of tort litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.432" offset="14644354">I would suggest that the Brown case, decided after Feres, and the Brooks case cited before it dealing with ex-servicemen and dealing with off-duty servicemen and finding Feres inapplicable even though there was a compensation system suggests that the military discipline factor is the preeminent one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3652.496" offset="14748635">Thank you.</text>
