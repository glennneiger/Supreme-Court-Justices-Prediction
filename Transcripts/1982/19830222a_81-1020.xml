            <text syncTime="664.200" offset="2804625">Thus, we submit that a lessor is a royalty owner and the... is a land owner, and the lessee is likewise a land owner under the jurisprudence of Alabama and most oil producing states.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.582" offset="2878185">There are three reasons for this.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.049" offset="2907965">The Alabama Code specifically provides that the tax will be levied in proportion to ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.999" offset="2935759">The Alabama Code specifically provides that producers shall include a royalty owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.245" offset="2976824">The Alabama Code specifically says that the tax is levied on the full stream of the well including that known as the royalty interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.631" offset="3018306">Furthermore, the Code provides... and this is not in any of the briefs and perhaps it should have been... The Code provides that the severance taxes in lieu of ad valorem taxes and ad valorem taxes, of course, being a tax on real estate and we say that the only reasonable, logical, fair classification is that of ownership of the production from the mineral fee and that there is no reasonable classification that can be... where it says four percent of the tax will be borne equally, but two percent will be borne unequally and disproportionate to the ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.626" offset="3218300">We submit to the Court that there is another reason that makes the tax regressive.</text>

            <text syncTime="839.097" offset="3504184">And, if that... the land owner should be the criteria for making a distinction between one molecule of gas and another molecule of gas; that the royalties' gas should be the same share of production as the working interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="879.676" offset="3666561">It simply is that some people prefer to invest on the royalty side and others invest on the working-interest side.</text>

            <text syncTime="931.170" offset="3872510">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="952.568" offset="3958087">Before Act 434 was adopted by the legislature of Alabama, the state had a very simple and understandable tax scheme for the severance taxation of oil and gas production.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.046" offset="4020050">The tax was imposed on all of the oil and gas produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.730" offset="4038754">There was a definition of who were the producers of that gas or oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.135" offset="4064354">It included both the royalty owner and the working-interest owner, each of whom bore the ultimate incidence of the tax in accordance with his or its ratable ownership of oil or gas produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.238" offset="4128719">When Act 434 was passed, however, we find a drastic change in the Alabama scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.452" offset="4165604">Because the legislature comes along and for the first time with respect to the two percent increase that was provided by that statute exempts the royalty owner... the royalty owner's share of production... from any portion of the tax increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.773" offset="4238956">The language of the statute was</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.491" offset="4249823">"any person who is a royalty owner shall be exempt from the payment of any increase in taxes herein levied and shall not be liable therefore. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.956" offset="4287648">To make doubly clear the intent of the legislature, they then proceeded with what is called in the briefing in this case the Pass-Through Prohibition in which they say,</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.092" offset="4336131">"the privilege tax herein levied shall be absorbed and paid by those persons engaged in the business of producing or severing oil or gas only. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.478" offset="4377718">"And the producer shall not pass on the cost of such tax payments either directly or indirectly to the consumer. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.444" offset="4409588">"It being the express intent of this Act that the tax herein levied shall be borne exclusively by the producer or severer of oil or gas. "</text>

            <text syncTime="1398.184" offset="5740579">The reason... a reason being, first that we think it is clear that the statutory prohibition and its conflict with the NGPA is not a severable item.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.803" offset="5795018">The legislature of Alabama never intended to say you cannot pass-through as to gas but you can as to oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.800" offset="5826992">So that if it is bad under the NGPA, it is bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.219" offset="5844651">And, it gets stricken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.719" offset="5850711">And, we think that is the easy, clear argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.843" offset="5863145">In the second place, two of my clients are engaged in the Tully litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.622" offset="5886342">It is their belief that the EPAA issues are properly addressed in the federal courts, the federal court system at Topeka.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.149" offset="5928451">If we were asked to express an opinion, and if this Court cares to pass on an EPAA thing, we certainly agree with the position taken by Amigee in its brief on that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.487" offset="5981741">But, we did not argue that in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.549" offset="5989996">What this act has done, is not only, you see, to tax the producer, the working interest owner, on his own share of production, but has required that he pick up the tax and pay it on the royalty owners' interest share of production.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.850" offset="6091247">Completely contrary to the definition of who shall be producers... completely contrary, we believe, to this Court's opinion in Barwise v. Sheppard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.971" offset="6139730">Now, it is interesting to see that when the state addresses the impairment question here, he makes no effort to try to meet the kinds of tests that the Court has laid down in Blazedale and his progeny insofar as the circumstances under which contracts may be impaired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.008" offset="6235860">All he does in substance is to say that the legislature probably was trying to avoid being perceived as levying a consumer tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.050" offset="6284030">Now, that may be a good political reason for a member of the legislature, but it certainly in our judgment does not express the kind of broad public general societal purpose that is required if you are going to have a constitutional impairment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.323" offset="6357069">And in this instance, our reasonable contractual expectations were certainly destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.789" offset="6386953">Even, Justice O'Connor, if the state were correct in rewriting the statute as they attempted to do, how do they take the part... what about the royalty owner?</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.081" offset="6436167">What do they say about that?</text>

            <text syncTime="2262.240" offset="9196788">Now, what they said is that under the Alabama law and a reading of the NGPA it is perfectly permissible for the first seller of the natural gas to include in the maximum lawful price the increase in the tax, just so long as he does not tack it on as a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.873" offset="9267318">Now, I take strong exception to something that Mr. Crowe said... I mean Mr. Arendall said... He said that the Natural Gas Policy Act requires clearly in its language that the tax be added to the maximum' lawful price as a tax.</text>
