            <text syncTime="7.839" offset="171647">Let's just give the crowd a minute or two to evaporate, Mr. Cohen.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.360" offset="417720">Mr. Cohen, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence M. Cohen</label>
            <text syncTime="84.417" offset="477907">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.322" offset="489505">In 1959 the Congress amended the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.963" offset="508104">They had two objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.913" offset="515941">One fundamental purpose was to strike from the prohibitions against secondary boycotts, close loopholes it had developed under the prior act, to preclude, as this Court indicated in Tree Fruits, coercion whether by picketing or otherwise, of a secondary employer to force him to cease doing business with the primary employer with whom a union had a labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.092" offset="604653">At the same time, however, Congress also sought to ensure that unions could appeal to the public for support.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.478" offset="634119">That they could disseminate information about a labor dispute, and that they could continue to place pressure not only on a primary employer, but on those secondary employers who chose to intertwine their fate, who had a unity of interest with the primary on the chain of production.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.989" offset="700156">The result as it was in many other labor parts... portions of the labor law... was a compromise.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.471" offset="722099">Some picketing was allowed, some picketing was prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.499" offset="738295">Some coercion was allowed, some collusion was prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.106" offset="752715">And some handbilling and other publicity was permitted, and some handbilling and other publicity was prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.934" offset="779987">This was spelled out in the publicity proviso, the Section 8(b)(4).</text>
            <text syncTime="164.618" offset="798690">Under that proviso handbilling could take... or any other publicity besides picketing is permitted if three conditions are met.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.881" offset="831813">First, the handbilling cannot be misleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.801" offset="847487">It must be for the purpose of truthfully advising the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.737" offset="859190">Secondly, it cannot result in a work stoppage at a secondary site.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.688" offset="879043">And finally, there must be a producer/distributor relationship between the primary and the secondary.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.949" offset="908091">If those conditions are met, and notwithstanding that the union's conduct is coercive, it's protected by the proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.277" offset="937348">If any of those conditions are not met, however, and the prohibitions of Section 8(b)(4) would otherwise be applicable, then there's an unlawful secondary boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.712" offset="979144">The issue in this case is whether an integral component of that compromise, a carefully established congressional balance, the producer/distributor relationship of the proviso is to be respected, and if it is respected, whether that deference is compatible with the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.672" offset="1050929">The facts of this case are generally stipulated and not in dispute and they're relatively simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.138" offset="1076842">We here have a company, a general contractor by the name of High, who is engaged to build a department store for a retailer by the name of Wilson.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.038" offset="1120414">The store is to be built as an addition to an existing shopping center that's already in operation, and it's owned by the Petitioner, DeBartolo.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.989" offset="1152179">The center has an 85 tenant stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.409" offset="1165867">It has two or three major retailers, Wards, Penneys, Belks, and Wilson's is going to be the fourth.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.816" offset="1191467">The union does not have any dispute with any of those tenants, does not have any dispute with DeBartolo.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.091" offset="1212574">Its dispute is with High, because High is not paying union standard wages and benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.793" offset="1235458">In order to pressure High, the union passes out handbills at all the entrances to the center and at various entrances to some of the tenant stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.836" offset="1271611">The handbills are not directed at High's.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.460" offset="1282060">They're not directed at Wilson's.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.774" offset="1287389">They're not confined to informing the public about the dispute the union has with High.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.504" offset="1306302">Instead, what they ask is that the consumers boycott all the stores at the center, in big bold capital letters at the top of the handbill which is at page 84, the Joint Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.033" offset="1348411">It says, don't shop at East Lake Square Mall.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.718" offset="1363144">The handbill specifically asks the customers not to patronize the tenant stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.730" offset="1387177">The board in the Court below held that that handbill was protected by the proviso, that even though it was otherwise a impermissible attempt to coerce secondaries, the tenant stores, it fell within the producer/distributor language of the proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.866" offset="1443706">The reasoning was that the product that was produced by High, the Wilson store, was not only being distributed by Wilson, it was being distributed by all the other tenant stores that were part of the shopping center.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.721" offset="1491144">Now we don't dispute here and have never disputed that Wilson's was distributing a product produced by High.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.014" offset="1520297">But under Servette that's a... and the other cases the board has decided since Servette... that was a distribution, the union could have properly passed out its handbill urging customers not to patronize Wilson's.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.385" offset="1573796">They could of course have picketed High.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.993" offset="1584244">That would have been primary picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.305" offset="1593440">They could have engaged in any kind of non-coercive activity they wanted, to publicize their dispute because then you would not have been under section 8(b)(4) at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.146" offset="1628862">Our disagreement is with the conclusion that the union could coercively handbill the tenant stores.</text>

            <text syncTime="733.742" offset="3075209">The reason we use the unity of interest test is because that was the term that was referred to in the Congressional debates arising out of the Goldfinger case.</text>

            <text syncTime="749.552" offset="3138426">What that test means is that a union follow through the chain of distribution to anyone in that chain who adds to the value of the product, and put pressure on anyone on that chain because they are enhancing the value of what the union is doing... I mean, what the primary is doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.134" offset="3216793">If somebody adds the value in the terms of the advertising, if somebody adds value in the terms of being a wholesaler like in Servette, they are helping the distribution of the product which the union has its dispute with.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.943" offset="3264022">So the union follows through the product and is able under the statute to handbill any of those people, and advise the public that they are assisting the practices which the union deems to be unfair.</text>

            <text syncTime="1440.493" offset="5902181">When Wilson's contracted with High to build its store at the East Lake Mall in Tampa owned by petitioner DeBartolo, the union passed out handbills at the mall appealing to the public not to shop at the Mall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.375" offset="5965711">The handbills are set out at page 84-A of the Joint Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.717" offset="5999147">I won't read it all, but, in essence, what the handbills pointed out was that the Wilson's department store was under construction on these premises and was being built by contractors who had paid substandard wages and fringe benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.303" offset="6077410">It explained that in the past, the mall's owner, DeBartolo, had insured that the mall and its stores were built by contractors who did pay fair wages and fringe benefits, and that the mall owner had departed from that requirement in the lease that it gave to Wilson's.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.153" offset="6172809">And the handbill ended up by asking the public in view of the fact that Wilson's was being built with allegedly unfair work standards, not to patronize the stores in the mall until the mall's owner publicly promises that all construction at the mall will be done using contractors who pay their employees fair wages and fringe benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.431" offset="6325991">And added that, however, if you must enter the mall to do business, please express to the store managers your concern over substandard wages and your support of our efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.770" offset="6383356">Now the Board did not decide whether this handbilling constituted restraint and coercion within the meaning of the operative part of 8(b)(4)ii(b) because it found that it was protected by the publicity proviso to the section which excludes publicity other than picketing for the purpose of fruitfully advising the public that a product or products are produced by an employer with whom a labor organization has a primary dispute and are distributed by another employer as long as such publicity does not have an effect of stopping deliveries, and there were no such work stoppages here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.148" offset="6656806">Now in Servette, decided 19 years ago, this Court, noting that the publicity proviso was the outgrowth of a profound Senate concern that the union's freedom to appeal to the public for support be adequately safeguarded, rejected a narrow reading of the producer/distributor language and sustained the Board's holding in Lohman that the terms as used in the proviso cannot be applied in a narrow literal manner but must be applied in a manner so as to effectuate Congress's concern in putting in the proviso which was, as I will outline in a moment, a concern that a ban on such publicity would present a First Amendment problem as Congress understood the cases under the First Amendment and the labor area in 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.944" offset="6984068">Now we submit that the Board's interpretation of the proviso in this case is faithful to the principles of Servette and to the legislative intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.659" offset="7038925">Now let me just briefly outline what was before Congress in 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.390" offset="7069854">As the Court may recall, the Landrum-Griffin bill passed by the House which embodied the Eisenhower Administration's proposals as to secondary boycotts was chiefly concerned with closing three loopholes that were perceived in 8(b)(4) as it then existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.927" offset="7147908">Direct inducement of a supervisor or secondary employer by a threat of labor trouble was not covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.769" offset="7179360">Appeals to individual employees were not covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.766" offset="7195347">Nor was inducement of employees of non-statutory employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.387" offset="7221782">There was no one in the Congress that thought that the amendments that were proposed would cover consumer boycotts until late in the debates on the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.506" offset="7290223">In August of '59, President Eisenhower delivered a radio address in which he pointed out that any new reform legislation should include a provision that banned consumer picketing by a union at a retail establishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.418" offset="7393877">On August 20, following the appointment of the House and the Senate conferees to work out a compromise on two versions of the proposed legislation, Senator Kennedy, who was to preside at the conference and Representative Thompson, who was one of the conferees, issued an analysis of the Landrum-Griffin bill which had by then passed the House, and criticized it in two respects that are relevant to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.854" offset="7551657">The first was that the House bill would prevent the union that had a dispute with an employer such as Coors Beer from picketing a restaurant with signs asking the public not to buy the product.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.207" offset="7613097">And the second concern was that the prohibition of the House bill reach not only picketing, but leaflets, radio broadcasts, and newspaper advertisements, thereby interfering with freedom of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.454" offset="7674014">Now, as this Court held in Tree Fruits, the first concern that picketing that just followed the struck product would be prohibited by the Landrum-Griffin bill was taken care of when they, the conferees, agreed that that would not come even within the restraints and coerce language in 8(b)(4)ii at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.653" offset="7846840">That the only picketing that would be covered would be picketing that cut off the neutrals' total business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.995" offset="7884248">And as this Court later held in Safco, in some circumstances where his business was only one product even following that product by picketing would be--</text>

            <text syncTime="1981.428" offset="8065956">And unless you interpret product so that it can include things other than physical products, whole industries would be not included within the scope of the proviso.</text>

            <text syncTime="2202.575" offset="8950566">"we were not able to persuade the House conferees to permit picketing in front of that secondary shop but we were able to persuade them to agree that the union shall be free to conduct informational activity short of picketing. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.178" offset="9008976">In other words, the union can hand out handbills at the shop and place advertisements in newspapers and make announcements over the radio and can carry on all publicity short of having ambulatory picketing in front of a secondary site.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.015" offset="9080342">Now as I indicated, shortly after the '59 amendments were enacted, and for more than two decades since, the Board has applied the proviso in the light cast by this legislative history and its basic purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="2845.951" offset="11524045">The fact of the matter is that when it became apparent that picketing, at least certain forms of consumer picketing, were covered by the restraint and coercion part of 8(b)(4)(b), the Senate conferees thought that out of an abundance of caution it was necessary to add the proviso to make doubly sure that this sort of publicity short of picketing would not be a violation of 8(b)(4)(b).</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence M. Cohen</label>
            <text syncTime="3241.416" offset="13105916">All handbilling... all do not patronize handbilling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.680" offset="13118978">The second point to make is, if incoercive, then we get to the proviso in the producer/distributor test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.725" offset="13151160">Now the Board admits in its briefs... it says very clearly... the Board has not read Servette to permit disregarding the producer/distributor language altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.252" offset="13185224">Producer/distributor has got to mean something.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.639" offset="13194837">Does it cover the type of attenuated relationship we have here?</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.686" offset="13211033">Well, let's take the example that the boycott the union sought here was totally one hundred percent effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.557" offset="13230468">Nobody came in to shop at the shopping center.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.088" offset="13240604">Would that have any effect whatsoever on High?</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.541" offset="13250426">The answer is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.808" offset="13255441">Now if that's what Congress intended by producer/distributor, that's not the way the act has been interpreted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.023" offset="13276339">And in any other law it's not the way that any member of Congress said it, not what Senator Kennedy was referring to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.004" offset="13300267">It's the exact opposite of any normal meaning of those words.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.739" offset="13319180">There's no way that the tenants here have any leverage over any of the... over Wilson's... or over High, excuse me... there's no way the tenants can effectuate his labor policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.841" offset="13359618">There's no way that they add in any way to anything that High does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.686" offset="13374978">And the pressure's being put on the tenants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.198" offset="13385009">So how are they part of the distribution/producer scheme?</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.822" offset="13403503">Finally, First Amendment argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.478" offset="13414161">Claiborne is the case that Mr. Come cites.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.648" offset="13426804">In Claiborne, this Court said secondary boycotts and picketing by labor unions may be prohibited constitutionally as part of Congress striking the balance, delicate balance between union freedom of expression and the ability of neutral employers and employees and consumers to remain free from coerced participation in an industrial strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.811" offset="13511441">That's the delicate balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.967" offset="13520114">That balance gives unions certain rights of expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.591" offset="13530563">Handbilling, as long as there's a producer/distributor relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.306" offset="13549476">Handbilling, as long as it's not misleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.837" offset="13559611">Handbilling, as long as it doesn't cause a secondary... handbilling or any form of publicity as long as it doesn't cause a secondary work stoppage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.603" offset="13586674">If those are met the union's got full freedom of expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.664" offset="13598899">The union's always got freedom of expression as long as it doesn't get engaged in coercion and restraint within the meaning of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.020" offset="13624290">Here, it engaged in coercion within the meaning of the act and it did not meet the terms of the proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.377" offset="13649786">Therefore there's a limited, narrow evil that Congress addressed, which is applicable here and this Court has held that just as in the case of secondary picketing it meets the narrow evil, any form of coercion as long as it's not too broad, and this is not too broad, may be regulated within the constitutional powers of the Congress.</text>
