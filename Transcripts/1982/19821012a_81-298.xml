            <label>Mr. Edgar F. Czarra, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="148.848" offset="769863">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this statutory construction case involves television programs for the deaf.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.936" offset="810196">Some background will establish the context for the specific facts and the narrow legal issue that is before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.781" offset="849589">Without visual aids, most deaf persons cannot understand the sound part of television.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.297" offset="879577">Government agencies and broadcasters have been working for more than a decade on ways to provide the deaf with suitable access to the sound part of television.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.615" offset="928896">Until early 1980, there were essentially two kinds of special visual aids that could help the deaf.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.259" offset="967453">One was sign language interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.482" offset="980305">The other was so-called open captions.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.515" offset="996501">While helpful to the deaf, both are visible on all television sets.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.251" offset="1023460">Because they are distracting and block part of the visual picture, both impact adversely on television service for the non-deaf majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.167" offset="1075078">Competing technologies to produce captions visible only to the deaf reached the developmental stage in the early 1970's, and have been evolving.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.716" offset="1125337">This is so-called closed captioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.720" offset="1141324">One system reached the marketplace in 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.180" offset="1155117">The other is not as far along, but it may offer more benefits in the long run.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.266" offset="1183538">Basically, both involve transmission of specially encoded signals that will produce captions only on television sets that have special decoding mechanisms.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.496" offset="1236410">Producing captions that fit the visual action is a sophisticated process involving skilled personnel and special equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.242" offset="1279355">It is far more complex than flashing a tornado warning across the bottom of the screen.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.678" offset="1309135">Some programs are not suited to captions at all, and caption is expensive, about $2,500 an hour, and public television's historic budget crunch has grown much worse lately.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.638" offset="1369007">Despite these difficult problems, great strides have been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.210" offset="1387293">Due to a combination of available approaches, deaf viewers throughout the country today have access to the sound part of many hours of television each week on both commercial and public stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.460" offset="1448315">Now, this case comes to the Court on a record that covers KCET's 1974 to 1977 license term.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.896" offset="1490007">This was long before closed captioning was in being.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.180" offset="1507143">Nevertheless, KCET had presented nearly 1,000 programs with special visual aids during that license term.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.225" offset="1547371">The Respondents requested the FCC to deny KCET's license renewal.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.950" offset="1574225">They claimed that KCET's programs for the deaf were not enough, and had not been presented in peak viewing hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.916" offset="1610065">Respondents focused on the comparatively new Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, that prohibits discrimination against handicapped persons by recipients of federal financial assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.088" offset="1682790">Respondents requested the FCC to use its license renewal processes to force KCET to provide more of the special services they believe that Section 504 required.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.996" offset="1746424">Three points made by the FCC in denying Respondents' complaint merit emphasis here.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.742" offset="1773383">First, the FCC found that KCET had offered special broadcasts for the deaf, and had not abused its discretion in scheduling them.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.000" offset="1822389">The only specific claims of KCET shortcomings were thus found baseless.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.545" offset="1852586">Second, the FCC reviewed the many steps it had taken under the general public interest standard of the Communications Act concerning television for the deaf, and some of these predated enactment of Section 504.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.477" offset="1920296">Third, the FCC concluded that it lacked Section 504 enforcement duties, because it did not dispense public funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.763" offset="1961464">The FCC deferred to the funding agencies to decide complaints of Section 504 violations, but the FCC made very clear that any finding of a Section 504 violation by KCET would be given weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.114" offset="2030846">Meanwhile, the Respondents went elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.655" offset="2041086">They filed a complaint against KCET at what is now the Department of Education, one of the funding agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.311" offset="2071701">They also brought a class action against KCET in District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.103" offset="2090823">Both complaints charged Section 504 discrimination, and both were eventually resolved in KCET's favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.311" offset="2131678">The Respondents then appealed the FCC's denial of their complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.104" offset="2150800">A panel of the D.C. Circuit, speaking through Judge Wright, with Judge McGowan dissenting, reversed the FCC.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.540" offset="2188625">Its decision ignored the extensive record evidence of KCET's service to the deaf, as well as the FCC's conclusions about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.217" offset="2227287">We ask this Court to reverse the D.C. Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.168" offset="2243064">The sole basis for the D.C. Circuit's decision was its belief that Section 504 expressed such a strong national policy in favor of the deaf that the FCC had to read the public interest standard in the Communications Act as if it incorporated the policy of Section 504.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.337" offset="2343793">The FCC thus was ordered independently to decide KCET's Section 504 compliance as part of the license renewal proceedings at the FCC.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.442" offset="2396247">The narrow issue this Court agreed to review is whether that novel incorporation theory is a legally correct interpretation of the intent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.711" offset="2445252">We say it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.052" offset="2454656">The mandatory incorporation theory is at war with this Court's holding that the FCC has very broad discretion to decide the scope of the public interest standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.621" offset="2504916">We have found no holding by this Court suggesting that the FCC must automatically read into the public interest standard policies expressed by the Congress in other statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.640" offset="2561027">The FCC is not required to incorporate the policy of another law unless the Congress directs it.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.335" offset="2595718">Of course, the FCC may and often does consider the policies of other statutes when it determines the scope of the public interest standard in the Communications Act, but that is an initial judgment that the Congress entrusted to the FCC.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.989" offset="2670428">The FCC exhibited leadership concerning television for the deaf.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.723" offset="2693311">The Court of Appeals acted as if the FCC had done nothing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1459.265" offset="6011489">The very structure of Section 504 points clearly in that direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.868" offset="6025909">504 is not applicable to all private entities or all that could be reached under the commerce clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="1473.755" offset="6069481">Congress merely attached certain conditions to the receipt of federal aid, and if one of those conditions is violated, then the most obvious and basic remedies are to cut off the funding or to enjoin the recipient from continued violation of the terms of the grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.596" offset="6132802">Now, the FCC and other licensing agencies, unlike the funding agencies and unlike the courts, lack the power to do either of those things.</text>

            <text syncTime="1507.779" offset="6205527">Beyond that, we believe that the legislative history of Section 504 clearly illustrates that Congress intended for that provision to be enforced by the funding agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.617" offset="6252860">There is nothing in Section 504 itself and nothing in the legislative history of that provision to indicate that Congress contemplated enforcement by agencies like the FCC.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.952" offset="6302284">And in our view, that is highly significant, for when Congress establishes a comprehensive administrative procedure for the enforcement of the statute, and commits that responsibility to a particular agency or agencies, and it says nothing about enforcement by other agencies, then we believe it may be fairly inferred that Congress intended... did not intend for those agencies to have the enforcement responsibility.</text>

            <text syncTime="1593.953" offset="6550238">Employment discrimination is different from captioning, for a number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.758" offset="6569464">First of all, probably the most important reason is that captioning, unlike refraining from discriminating on the basis of race or any other invidious classification, captioning is a problem of considerable technical complexity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.818" offset="6629651">The technology is in flux.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.508" offset="6636442">There are competing technologies at this time, and it is the Commission's judgment in the exercise of its discretion in bringing its expertise to bear on this problem that at the present time under its public interest standard technological progress may best be stimulated by refraining from imposing compulsory constraints, but the Commission has made it clear that it will continue to monitor developments in this area, and will not hesitate to impose mandatory requirements if sufficient progress is not demonstrated by the broadcasters, if the remaining technical and financial questions are not resolved, and perhaps after Section 504's meaning is clarified by the funding agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.626" offset="6812926">Let me address a bit more directly this question of employment discrimination, because it is central to Respondent's argument and also to the reasoning of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.014" offset="6854513">I think it is important to recognize that the Commission's treatment of employment discrimination and its treatment of the problem of captioning and making television understandable for the deaf is parallel in many respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.053" offset="6910624">The Commission does not enforce Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which deals with employment discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.687" offset="6941135">The Commission does not enforce Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.491" offset="6964436">The Commission has stated that under its public interest standard, it will take into account employment discrimination by licensees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.376" offset="6999962">Similarly, under its public interest standard, the Commission has long sought technically and financially feasible means of making television accessible to hearing impaired viewers, but it has reached the judgment that imposing mandatory captioning requirements at the present time under the public interest standard is not wise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.930" offset="7078121">The second point to remember is that the FCC voluntarily and in the exercise of its discretion decided to take on the responsibility for looking at employment discrimination by licensees.</text>
