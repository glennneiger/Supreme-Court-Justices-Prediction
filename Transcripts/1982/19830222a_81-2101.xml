            <label>Mr. H. Bartow Farr, III</label>
            <text syncTime="77.885" offset="465179">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.574" offset="471971">May it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="81.340" offset="478972">This case returns to this Court after a two-year absence.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.290" offset="494854">As the Court will recall, in 1978, the District Court, relying on federal constitutional, federal statutory, and state statutory grounds, ordered that Pennhurst State School and Hospital, a facility for the mentally retarded, be closed and that all of its residents be moved to community living alternatives known as CLAs.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.360" offset="587119">On appeal, the Third Circuit, relying on the Developmental Disability Act, the federal statute not relied on by the District Court, essentially affirmed the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.290" offset="630795">It did modify the order, however, to allow some residents to remain at Pennhurst.</text>

            <text syncTime="124.757" offset="652634">You will at some point address the question of mootness, possible mootness, will you not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="h_bartow_farr_iii" startTime="129.616" stopTime="311.040">
            <label>Mr. H. Bartow Farr, III</label>
            <text syncTime="129.616" offset="672069">The question of mootness, Mr. Chief Justice, goes to the particular issue of the Special Master and Alan Warshaw will discuss that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.441" offset="699445">I will discuss it first if you would prefer.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.034" offset="709790">The Third Circuit, on the initial appeal, ordered the District Court to make individual determinations about the appropriateness of an improved Pennhurst for each resident.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.823" offset="760885">It further ordered the District Court or Master to apply a presumption in favor of placing people in CLA's and said that unless Pennhurst was the only appropriate place for a resident CLA's must be provided&gt; ["].</text>
            <text syncTime="169.255" offset="830684">This Court reversed, finding that the DD Act did not impose such massive obligations on the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.438" offset="867360">It then remanded the case to the Third Circuit for consideration of the other issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.453" offset="887422">On remand, the Third Circuit issued exactly the same order, this time resting its decision entirely on state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.793" offset="920859">The Court rejected our argument that the 11th Amendment barred the order and, furthermore, that in the event the 11th Amendment did not bar it, the principles of Comity should do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.572" offset="963909">As a result we believe that the Third Circuit has expanded the power of the federal courts at the expense of state officials, state legislatures, and ultimately, state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.253" offset="1014691">Now, as I have explained, Mr. Chief Justice, I will particularly address the 11th Amendment issues on which there is no mootness point, and Allen Warshaw will discuss the other issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.733" offset="1052621">Before turning to the merits of the 11th Amendment issue, I would like to talk briefly about the relationship between the 11th Amendment and the Doctrine of Pendent Jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.946" offset="1101417">For the Third Circuit, in rejecting our 11th Amendment argument, placed considerable weight on the fact that the state law claim, on which all of the relief now rests, was a pendent claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.113" offset="1150110">Our position on this issue is straightforward.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.375" offset="1167142">The Doctrine of Pendent Jurisdiction is not sufficient to override a constitutional bar like the 11th Amendment any more than the exercise of diversity jurisdiction or admiralty jurisdiction or any other general grant of jurisdiction would be able to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.663" offset="1240284">For example, it would be inconceivable if the original claim in Chisholm v. Georgia, the very claim that prompted the passage of the 11th Amendment, could now be brought after the passage of the 11th Amendment in federal court simply by making it a pendent claim rather than a diversity claim as it was in Chisholm.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.563" offset="1327847">Without a valid basis of jurisdiction under Article III, of course, the issue of the 11th Amendment is never reached, but once valid jurisdiction under Article III is found, the question still must be answered, is a particular claim barred by the 11th Amendment?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="311.040" offset="1397855">How do you distinguish the holding of this Court about the 11th Amendment in Green v. Louisville Railroad case?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="h_bartow_farr_iii" startTime="321.379" stopTime="363.407">
            <label>Mr. H. Bartow Farr, III</label>
            <text syncTime="321.379" offset="1439128">The decision in Green does not ever address the question specifically, of course, as to whether the pendent claim has to be examined under the 11th Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.985" offset="1473610">I think that holding has been seriously undercut by the holding in Edelman, which the Court decided ten years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.076" offset="1497956">In Edelman the Court did exactly what we are saying they should do in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.042" offset="1513839">It first looked to see whether the Court properly exercised pendent jurisdiction, citing Hagans v. Lavine, the leading case.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.787" offset="1544768">It then, however, having found that the Court did properly exercise pendent jurisdiction, went on to conclude that the claim was barred by the 11th Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.129" offset="1582175">Now, to the extent that Green is inconsistent with that, we think Edelman is already undercut.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="363.407" offset="1607253">Edelman did involve just a federal statutory claim with what relief was ultimately granted on it, wasn't it?</text>
            <text syncTime="369.686" offset="1632435">It was not a state claim.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. H. Bartow Farr, III</label>
            <text syncTime="370.747" offset="1636614">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.998" offset="1641630">I think it is important though to keep these two issues separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.512" offset="1655736">Our position here is that the exercise of pendent jurisdiction does not affect whether the claim is barred by the 11th Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.631" offset="1688128">If you find that it is barred by the 11th Amendment, then the exercise of pendent jurisdiction doesn't make any difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.161" offset="1718325">Now, the second part of my argument, of course, is that this claim, although it is not a federal statutory claim, is barred by the 11th Amendment.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="399.205" offset="1750508">And, why it is barred?</text>
            <text syncTime="402.688" offset="1764405">Because it is against the state?</text>

            <text syncTime="404.295" offset="1770779">In this particular case, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.794" offset="1780810">The short answer, and I have a longer answer that I will give, the short answer is that it is a claim against the state and it is not taken outside of the 11th Amendment by the unusual principles of Ex Parte Young that apply only when--</text>

            <text syncTime="618.206" offset="2626446">That is correct, Justice Brennan.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.316" offset="2634910">The second principle is that the Amendment bars suits, not just for damages, but for injunctive relief as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.345" offset="2666988">The Court reaffirmed that principle last term in Cory v. White and the language of the 11th Amendment referring to any suit in law or equity would leave little doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.293" offset="2706799">The third principle, and the one which Justice White was alluding to earlier, the Amendment bars suits against the states, not just in name, but in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.491" offset="2747654">Although the Court took awhile to get around to that holding, originally holding that the state had to be named as a defendant, it is now clear, from the cases of this Court, that the Plaintiffs could not get around the 11th Amendment by naming state officials as the nominal defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.065" offset="2809930">In such cases, as in this one, the Court must look to the nature of the claim asserted and the nature of the relief granted to determine whether the state is, in fact, the real party in interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.652" offset="2860294">Now, the fourth principle is the principle of Ex Parte Young which, where applicable, puts a limitation on the second and third principles just discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.023" offset="2905747">According to that principle, a federal court may allow injunctive relief against a state official and may do so even if the result is to cause an expenditure of state funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.784" offset="2952768">The reason for this exception, as stated in Young, is that a state has no power to impart to a state official any immunity from responsibility to the supreme authority of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.760" offset="3008670">Thus, where there is a conflict with the Constitution or with supreme federal law, it is not necessary to ask, as you do in the normal case, whether the state official is acting within his colorable authority or whether the impact of the order is on the state treasury because it makes no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.971" offset="3089545">The state cannot confer an immunity from obedience to the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.499" offset="3115667">Now, while the logic of Ex Parte Young has been questioned, the doctrine of the case has long been thought necessary to the federal system, for without it, the ability of the federal courts to enforce federal rights would be greatly undercut.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.945" offset="3169375">But, the doctrine has been severely limited to suit that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.583" offset="3191945">For example, the Court has declined to extend Ex Parte Young to allow damages payable from a state treasury even though the claim is a constitutional one and the logic of Ex Parte Young conceivably could be stretched to fit that case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1207.691" offset="4984363">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.470" offset="4999514">If I may I will address the Comity issue first and then the master issue including the mootness issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.107" offset="5022084">Obviously, if you agree with us that the 11th Amendment bars a decision on the state law issues in this case, you need go no further.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.962" offset="5053535">However, even if the 11th Amendment permits such claims, principles of Comity do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.725" offset="5076523">Rather, those principles prohibit a decision based solely on state law when the likely result with be a federal court order requiring expenditure of state funds and controlling the operation of state programs solely to implement state laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.222" offset="5138485">In this regard, essentially three principles apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.625" offset="5156144">First, federal courts must display a strict regard for the independence of state government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.139" offset="5178191">Second, they must avoid needless friction with a state's domestic policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.121" offset="5198149">Third, they must be reluctant to interfere with the fiscal operations of a state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.226" offset="5218524">And, in addition, I would note that this Court has recently counseled federal courts to show a substantial deference to the judgments of qualified professionals chosen by a state to operate its mental retardation systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.818" offset="5268888">Each of these principles was violated in this case by the Third Circuit as it apparently solely or primarily, for reasons of federal court convenience, sanctioned a massive and ongoing intrusion into Pennsylvania's domestic policies, its fiscal operations and the judgments of its qualified mental retardation professionals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.996" offset="5345584">Specifically, in this case the lower courts have taken a vague right to treatment in the least restrictive environment, and have assumed the power to apply it in over a thousand cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.990" offset="5393649">More importantly, they have taken this supposed right from state cases involving one person where funding was not an issue and have tried to apply it on a state-wide basis where limited resources required difficult choices between competing needs, rights, and priorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.673" offset="5460314">In short, the court has essentially taken control of Pennsylvania's $160 million community program for the mentally retarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.981" offset="5489571">For example, in July of 1982, well after the Third Circuit had held that its orders were based solely on state law, the District Court roundly condemned Commonwealth officials for their failure to place more plaintiff class members in CLAs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.663" offset="5564281">It found wholly unacceptable... and I quote its word... the state officials excuse and explanation that they had expended available funds moving the residents of another institution into CLAs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.014" offset="5609734">In so doing it apparently found entirely irrelevant uncontroverted evidence, testimony by a number of state officials, that the reason they had given priority to the other institution was that its conditions were dangerously deteriorating.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.121" offset="5662084">It was about to lose federal approval, and it was about to lose substantial federal funding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.994" offset="5681623">In contrast, Pennhurst at that time and today has full federal approval, meets all applicable federal standards, and receives substantial federal funding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.020" offset="5721747">More recently, the Court has ordered the state to place over 270 class members in CLAs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.800" offset="5752885">It has done so despite clear evidence that anticipating funding would not be sufficient to fund those placements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.593" offset="5780053">It also ignored testimony by state officials that there were simply priorities in the mental retardation area that should have been given higher priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.451" offset="5811399">Thus, the District Court has imposed its policy, fiscal and professional judgment on defendants in a way which is given precedence to its decree to the exclusion of all other competing interests in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.599" offset="5864062">Moreover, it has done so without any regard for the many other mentally retarded people in Pennsylvania whose right is presumably identical and whose need was apparently greater.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.706" offset="5908471">This already massive intrusion has been exacerbated by the appointment of Masters, who over a five-year period at a cost of over $3 million have monitored and supervised in detail and on a daily basis the operation of Pennsylvania's programs for the mentally retarded.</text>

            <text syncTime="1490.401" offset="6115256">We have paid up until the time that the legislature expressed its will and forbade us from paying state monies for that purpose, which is the subject of a Contempt also pending before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.054" offset="6149842">I believe it is 81-2363 in a Cert Petition which is pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.991" offset="6177636">Yes, there have been substantial monies at issue, and at least Judge Garth in the lower court recognized that should we prevail on the Master issue, we would certainly be entitled, in a very real way, to the $300,000 which are still in the custody of the District Court as a result of the Contempt fines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.218" offset="6250466">Moreover, I should note that there are requests pending in the District Court to reinstate the Master.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.371" offset="6275125">And, in fact, throughout the course of this litigation, there have been so many disputes over implementation, I cannot imagine that if this case were to be remanded in its present form that the District Court would not be asked on a repeated basis to reinstate the now defunct Special Master.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.659" offset="6340327">But, I once again would contend, the issues are identical as to the Special Master and the Hearing Master, and we believe they are still alive through the Hearing Master and through the fines which are being held in the District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1567.919" offset="6425277">I do not think you have to reach the Comity issue or the Master issue if the Court should not have based its orders at all on state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.885" offset="6453176">Now, I would also note in relation to the Master issue that this is something that at best is necessary under extraordinary circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.896" offset="6489225">Yet, in this case the Court has utilized these Masters to supervise a community placement program which even Respondents conceded the last time we were before this Court... at Page 40 of the transcript and in addition at Page 66 of the Halderman brief... was a leader in the nation when this case was commenced, and certainly the testimony at trial was unanimous on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.058" offset="6573862">Moreover, as I have noted, any argument... and this has been made by Respondents in some respects... that the Courts were doing that which we wish them to do is belied by the fact that the legislature explicitly refused to fund these Masters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.226" offset="6630599">Certainly, the Masters at least had nothing to do with the will of Pennsylvania's officials or its legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.051" offset="6653796">Now I think it is our point that this kind of constant daily ongoing intrusion into wholly state programs, whether it is accomplished by a court, by itself, or with the assistance of Masters, is the kind of intrusion that should be undertaken only in the most extraordinary circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.887" offset="6725163">And, in this regard, I should note that the United States appears to agree with us, insofar as we are talking about the Master.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.447" offset="6751390">When, as in this case, it is based solely on state law and serves no federal purpose whatsoever, it is an unacceptable use of the federal judicial power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.177" offset="6806351">It is a use which this Court should terminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.237" offset="6818577">Thank you for your consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.312" offset="6826936">I would like to reserve our remaining time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="3050.553" offset="12355804">The United States suggests in its brief, and we agree and submit to the Court, that the Third Circuit in this case responsibly followed the guidelines long established by this Court in Gibbs, in Siler and in Ashwander.</text>

            <text syncTime="3189.902" offset="12913257">Now, the policy in Ashwander, as you suggest, Justice White, really derives from two considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.634" offset="12936141">One is the policy against... A constitutional policy like the one against splintered litigation, a policy against the unnecessary decision of constitutional question for its own sake, for the integrity of constitutional judgments, the avoidance of prematurity and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.142" offset="13006253">But, there is quite an independent policy of which Ashwander and Siler, which, of course, is the father to Ashwander, partake and that is federalism itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.606" offset="13048049">One of the reasons for avoiding constitutional decisions in cases involving state defendants is precisely that they are so intrusive and the constitutional decision binds the state officials forever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.069" offset="13097891">A decision on pendent state law grounds leaves state officials free to try to change state law rather than exercising that freedom.</text>

            <text syncTime="3538.447" offset="14307465">It also vacated the instructions to assist in the planning of relief, a function, a duty for which the appointment of a Master, I take it, is unexceptional when as here the state defendants twice refused to come forward to the court with a plan for implementation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.112" offset="14390116">In Swann, for example, such a Master was appointed and this Court, of course, affirmed generally there.</text>

            <text syncTime="3575.855" offset="14457094">Counsel seems to argue that the 11th... the 14th Amendment simply knocks over the 11th Amendment and then the pendent claims can follow in behind it without having been tested against the 11th Amendment and he cites Edelman for that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.848" offset="14528983">Edelman, as we discussed this morning, simply doesn't stand for that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.735" offset="14548627">The Court made exactly the inquiry in Edelman that we say should be made here, whether the particular claim at issue was barred by the 11th Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.229" offset="14586557">For the prospective relief in Edelman, the Court found that that claim was not barred by the 11th Amendment under the principles of Ex Parte Young which applied to that claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.914" offset="14629293">For the claim that dealt with retroactive relief, it found that it was barred by the 11th Amendment because Ex Parte Young does not cover that type of claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.191" offset="14666387">Our argument, as I said this morning, is that Ex Parte Young does not cover the kind of claim that we have in this case and, therefore, Edelman fully supports our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.298" offset="14706825">Secondly, counsel has said that state law... I believe Mr. Ferleger said... has been clear for 16 years and that this is a lawless effort by the state officials to ignore it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.887" offset="14753218">First of all, we don't think it was clear when the complaint was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.869" offset="14769101">We don't think it was clear when the District Court said state law required the closing of Pennhurst.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.946" offset="14789476">We don't think it was clear when the Third Circuit on the first appeal said that state law did not require the creation of CLA's, but only that to the extent that there are facilities being maintained that they provide adequate care and habilitation and frankly we don't think it is clear now because the decisions from the Pennsylvania Court do not deal with the issue of how to provide CLA's where the legislature has not provided funding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.419" offset="14891354">Those issues are not present in the state cases where a single individual is concerned and the issue of whether there is funding for one person is not an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3695.290" offset="14934822">Furthermore, the District Court, in rejecting a claim for damages, said there was no reason to think that the State Defendants were not carrying out the duties to their best of ability and had no reason to know that they were violating any law or any rights of the Plaintiffs at that time and that is at page 75-A of the original... of the Appendix of the original Petition for Certiorari--</text>
