            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="131885">We will hear arguments first this morning in the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency against the Sierra Club.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.681" offset="174517">Ms. Oberly, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Ms. Kathryn A. Oberly</label>
            <text syncTime="14.838" offset="191235">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.821" offset="203147">This is a Clean Air Act case in which the District of Columbia Circuit has ordered the government to pay respondents $90,000 in attorney's fees even though they were completely unsuccessful on the merits of their lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.251" offset="264796">The government challenges this fee award because we don't believe that Congress has authorized attorney's fees for totally unsuccessful parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.824" offset="303144">The case began in 1979 when respondents filed petitions for review in the Court of Appeals challenging EPA's new Source Performance Standards for coal-fired generating plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.054" offset="360091">EDF, the Environmental Defense Fund didn't challenge the substance of the regulations at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.830" offset="387154">Instead, it argued that EPA had had meetings with people outside of the agency after the close of the public comment period and that those meetings had resulted in a less stringent standard being adopted than would have otherwise been the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.248" offset="452773">The Sierra Club challenged EPA's statutory authority to adopt the type of performance standard that it did and it also claimed that the rule was unsupported by evidence in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.023" offset="503973">The Court of Appeals rejected each and every one of respondent's arguments and upheld the EPA standards in every respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.174" offset="544515">The court did write an extremely lengthy and comprehensive opinion on the merits, but nowhere in that opinion did the court suggest that its decision to uphold the regulations was a close one or that EPA had in any way acted improperly during the rulemaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.998" offset="607836">After the decision on the merits, respondents sought attorney's fees under Section 307(f) of the Clean Air Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.056" offset="644094">That section provides that in any judicial proceeding to review EPA regulations a court may award reasonable attorney fees whenever it determines that a fee award would be "appropriate".</text>
            <text syncTime="143.315" offset="705116">The dispute in this case is about what Congress meant by the use of the word appropriate.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>

            <text syncTime="160.355" offset="773243">We're happy to take that burden on, Your Honor, because we believe it was an abuse of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.697" offset="798634">When one looks at Congress's purposes in enacting this statute, it becomes clear that Congress did not intend or contemplate that attorney's fees would be awarded to losing parties, who neither prevailed in the technical sense of obtaining a final judgment in court, nor prevailed in the nontechnical sense of getting the agency to change its conduct, change the regulations or in any way alter its administration of the act.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="194.933" offset="911588">--What do you think Congress meant by the language when appropriate that fees should be awarded... when appropriate?</text>

          <turn speaker="kathryn_a_oberly" startTime="203.746" stopTime="362.210">
            <label>Ms. Kathryn A. Oberly</label>
            <text syncTime="203.746" offset="946801">We think the legislative history shows that Congress meant two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.915" offset="959444">There were two classes of plaintiff... of litigants that Congress was concerned about.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.646" offset="978461">The first class was prevailing defendants, which would include the government, who were subjected to frivolous or harassing litigation and the second class would be plaintiffs who either won in court in the traditional sense of obtaining a judgment or who achieved the result they set... or something close to the result they set out to achieve without obtaining a formal judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.919" offset="1067487">That could be done, for example, by a settlement or by EPA agreeing to change its regulations, by something short of a final judgment on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.164" offset="1108447">But there is no indication, Your Honor, in the legislative history that Congress understood that, or thought that it was authorizing fees to parties whose only contribution to the Clean Air Act was to have a court validate precisely what the agency had done.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.314" offset="1177096">The Court of Appeals standard in this case is that attorney's fees are appropriate whenever a party substantially contributes to the goals of the Clean Air Act and on its face, we don't have a real quarrel with that standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.401" offset="1237387">Our problem is with the standard as applied to this and other cases like it where the plaintiffs, or the petitioners, have failed to accomplish anything concrete for the purposes of the Clean Air Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.664" offset="1290468">The court found that the way respondents had contributed to the goals of the clean air act was by labeling judicial review itself as an express and an overriding goal of the statute and then it found that respondents had contributed to that goal here by making exemplary presentations on novel, important and complex issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.965" offset="1387643">Our problem with that ruling is that Congress has never said in the statute, which does set out the goals of the statute, that judicial review is an overriding goal, an express goal or any goal at all of the Clean Air Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.023" offset="1443963">It's quite clear from the purposes of the statute that the primary goal of the statute and the relevant one to this case is to improve and maintain the quality of the nation's air and when EPA fails to do that by not following Congress' instructions, then judicial review does help to further that goal.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.405" offset="1525465">But when EPA has already done what Congress told it to do, judicial review for its own sake is not a statutory goal and it's certainly not one that Congress had indicated it wanted to subsidize with attorney's fee awards.</text>

            <text syncTime="533.624" offset="2266298">But in none of those statutes is there, just like the Clean Air Act, there's no legislative history to indicate the Congress thought it was authorizing fee awards to parties who failed to prevail in court or out of court, and so they've not, in our opinion, added anything to the statute that you have before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.867" offset="2347278">They've added Congress using the same language in other statutes, but again, no additional evidence that Congress contemplated the idea of paying fees to totally unsuccessful parties.</text>

            <text syncTime="815.980" offset="3395728">See, we don't have such a statute.</text>

            <label>Ms. Kathryn A. Oberly</label>
            <text syncTime="817.369" offset="3401266">You would have to look to the guidance of your statute, if you had one.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.229" offset="3416731">And when you look to the guidance of the Clean Air Act, you don't find that Congress thought that the Justice Department needed assistance from self-volunteering public interest groups to help in defending EPA regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.035" offset="3475976">They may, in fact, provide such assistance in such cases, but it's not something that can go into expecting the government to pay the bill when we're already paying our own lawyers to defend these regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.203" offset="3520594">And in this case, EPA filed a 200 page brief on the merits and EPA felt, the Justice Department felt that it could defend its own interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.464" offset="3557687">We did not ask for help from the Sierra Club or the Environmental Defense Fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.524" offset="3573883">The fact that they wanted to offer it is their decision, but there's no indication that Congress thought that the government needed help from public interest groups in defending its own interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.426" offset="3621531">That's simply mentioned nowhere in the statute or the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.548" offset="3638040">An important point that I'd like to stress is that Congress has expressly considered legislation that would authorize fees for parties who don't prevail at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.576" offset="3690181">An early version of the Equal Access to Justice Act expressly had such a provision in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.776" offset="3714945">The Justice Department objected to that proposal as being radical and unacceptable and Congress immediately dropped it from the Act so that the Act as passed now requires a plaintiff to prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.287" offset="3761025">The fact is that Congress has never passed a statute that says the winning party is to pay the other side's attorney's fees, even though it has had the opportunity to consider legislation that would do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.391" offset="3817449">On the other hand, in several statutes cited in our brief, Congress has authorized the payment of attorney's fees just to allow citizens to participate in agency rulemaking proceedings, even when their views are not adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.194" offset="3876590">So, there's no question that Congress knows how to draft the kind of language that the Court of Appeals read into the statute in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.582" offset="3906161">But the obvious fact is that that language just isn't here.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.517" offset="3921939">Respondents claim that if the government's position were correct, there would have been no need for Congress to change from the prevailing party standard that it's used in other statutes and switch to an appropriate standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.935" offset="3987558">But what they've overlooked is that in 1970, which is the year that this type of standard was first passed, the courts were interpreting prevailing to mean that a party had to have a technical final, favorable judgment in his favor in order to be eligible for fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.507" offset="4057880">It wasn't until at least 1976 or 1977 that the courts started liberalizing the interpretation of prevailing party so that in 1970, for example, when the origin of this statute first came into being, a party who prevailed by way of settlement would not necessarily have been treated as a prevailing party for purposes of an attorney's fee award.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.511" offset="4165923">And it was, therefore, necessary in 1970 for Congress to adopt a different standard than the prevailing party standard in order to bring in to that group of plaintiffs eligible for fee awards plaintiffs who accomplish their result without getting a favorable final judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.065" offset="4236140">That situation, that state of the law is, as regards the meaning of prevailing party, continued up through 1976, 1977, in fact it wasn't until 1980 that this court held that a party who obtained relief by way of settlement could be deemed a prevailing party for purposes of attorney's fee awards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.447" offset="4321612">So, in our view, at the time this statute was first passed it was, in fact, necessary for Congress to adopt a different standard, the appropriate standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.647" offset="4366438">But that doesn't go as far as respondents would take it or as far as the Court of Appeals would take it to show that Congress actually intended or even thought about the notion of paying fees to parties who accomplish no tangible benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.060" offset="4428087">I would also remind the court that, given the country's long tradition against fee shifting, and given the fact that we're aware of no other situation in which a winning party has been ordered to pay a losing party's fees, it's simply not plausible to assume that Congress would have passed this type of legislation without mentioning it, without debating it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1114.311" offset="4589106">Here, this is the victorious party, EPA, paying the other side's fees and what's more important, or equally important, is that the statute is not limited to the government as defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.119" offset="4648352">Section 304 of the Act, the citizen suit provision, would have private parties being a defendant as often as the government and I find it implausible to think that Congress would have assessed attorney's fees against a winning corporate defendant without saying that it actually meant for the winning corporate defendant to pick up the other side's legal fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.419" offset="4753469">There's nothing in the legislative history to show that Congress contemplated that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.651" offset="4770396">As far as the government is concerned, the situation here is really quite similar to what the court had before it in Lehman v.

            <text syncTime="1201.290" offset="4936953">It's first a statutory construction case and then, did the Court of Appeals abuse the discretion once the statute is properly interpreted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.895" offset="4983451">I think it's really undisputed in this case by respondents that they didn't win any of their claims on the merits and so what we're left with is whether they still somehow helped to accomplish a goal of the Clean Air Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.778" offset="5054922">And again, we think judicial review is not a goal the Congress set in and of itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.667" offset="5078536">So all respondents can claim they did was get the Court of Appeals to render a decision validating what EPA had already done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.680" offset="5118556">Their lawsuit did nothing to change, improve, alter EPA's administration or implementation of the Clean Air Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.378" offset="5149381">They claim to have achieved certain public benefits, but as we have shown in our reply brief, those benefits are completely lacking in substance and there are just two of them that I'd like to mention here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.513" offset="5197864">First, EDF claims that it forced the government to disclose important documents that had never before been revealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.965" offset="5227643">That claim is simply false.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.903" offset="5235480">What EPA, excuse me, what EDF wanted was to depose high-ranking EPA officials from the administrator on down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.868" offset="5271320">That request was denied by the Court of Appeals as inappropriate and unnecessary and instead, what EDF got was affidavits describing what they already knew, the fact that meetings had taken place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.830" offset="5323147">So as far as we're concerned, this case isn't even as strong a claim for fees as Hanrahan v. Hampton, in which the court held that a victory on procedural issues that doesn't relate to the merits is insufficient for an attorney's fee award.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.761" offset="5382915">Here, EDF didn't even get the procedural victory that it wanted and it certainly didn't get any relief on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.367" offset="5409351">EDF also claims that the court's merits opinion changed the... caused the government to alter the way it handles ex parte communications in rulemakings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.958" offset="5451669">Again, that's not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.052" offset="5460029">The court found that EPA's procedures were just fine the way they were before this lawsuit was brought and EDF has not shown that those procedures have been altered in any way since the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.063" offset="5508094">As a final point, I'd like to make it clear that we're not downplaying the importance of allowing citizen plaintiffs full access to the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.758" offset="5550830">But our position does not mean that that access will be cut off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.040" offset="5567967">If the court holds that a plaintiff has to accomplish something concrete before it can expect to have the government pick up the bill, it will still be sufficient incentive, economic incentive, for plaintiffs with meritorious cases to bring suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.192" offset="5624600">That's all Congress ever indicated it was authorizing and we believe that anything going beyond that, such as the Court of Appeals decision in this case, is an abuse of discretion and inconsistent with the statute that Congress has written.</text>

            <text syncTime="1399.900" offset="5731389">Harold Tyler for the respondents, Sierra Club and Environmental Defense Fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.223" offset="5752705">Basically, our difficulties and disagreements with the United States in this case come down to a difference in reading in the statutory language and quite a substantial difference in our appraisal of the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.217" offset="5828669">Indeed, it seems to me that the government is taking a rather successively naive version of what actually happened in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.791" offset="5874958">To begin with, as you know, in 1970 this language did come into the Clean Air Act and some other statutes of an environmental nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.067" offset="5924068">In the year 1970 Section 304 was the area and the type of suit for which Congress did pass this statute saying that fees could be awarded when appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.511" offset="5989896">Unfortunately, the government tends to ignore what happened thereafter leading up to the 1977 amendments which, in very simple terms, we urge, made it very clear that Congress specifically was trying to address what had happened in the intervening years in terms of appropriate judicial review, particularly of rulemaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.938" offset="6095536">Congress was certainly aware that Section 304 did not specifically authorize petitions to review regulations or rulemaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.152" offset="6132421">In fact, prior to 1977 at least two courts, the Fifth Circuit and the D.C. Circuit, had held that the law was unclear and that even though Judge Levin Campbell, speaking for the First Circuit, had allowed with his panel a petition for review under Section 307, Congress thought that they should address that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.921" offset="6223536">And so they did by passing in 1977 very specific legislation underscoring a congressional tenet, we say, to encourage citizens and groups with expertise in the environmental field to seek review of EPA rulemaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.398" offset="6321443">Now, the government tosses this off as being a situation where they didn't ask for the Sierra Club to come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.987" offset="6351745">They didn't ask for the Environmental Defense Fund to come in, and all of this would have been resolved very much easily, more easily, much more timely, had there not been this petition for review, which you know about, was filed in this important case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.824" offset="6423111">Well, the fact is, we urge that what happened is that Congress illustrated very clearly that, contrary to what the government argues, they want 307 cases to keep EPA honest, to put it in simplistic, blunt terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.394" offset="6485387">But more importantly and more fairly, perhaps, they wish to encourage outsiders, particularly outsiders like these two organizations, who have competence to handle these complex cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1633.332" offset="6665109">But here's what they did say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.048" offset="6672006">The House and the Senate were aware that the First Circuit had reasoned that in a case, which as the government fairly points out, there the environmental groups were not total losers, in the old fashioned tort contract--</text>

            <text syncTime="1653.337" offset="6745149">But the rationale of Judge Campbell seems to us to be very clear and seems, more importantly than to us, to the Congress to have indicated, as Judge Campbell pointed out, that there should be an encouragement for citizen suits in this complex field where people just don't have the money or the competence or the expertise to, you know, just sort of come in and do it easily.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.136" offset="6872417">This is a case where not any doubt, I think, what Congress intended to do was not to reward counsel in the sense of giving restitution to counsel or their clients, such as the Sierra Club or EDF, but to encourage them to come in and speak their piece in judicial review proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="1711.346" offset="6977221">Well that's a perfectly understandable motive if Congress, indeed, did entertain it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.282" offset="6996969">But my question still remains, why didn't they spell it out to some extent, rather than simply using the word appropriate?</text>

            <text syncTime="1723.045" offset="7024032">Well, there is language in the legislative history, concededly, if I were standing here today and had a chance to rewrite what was said, I'd have it a lot clearer, I agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.585" offset="7074187">But there's a number of strands of evidence, if you will, Justice Rehnquist, indicating the Congress understood quite clearly that this isn't a simplistic situation, like the government argues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.596" offset="7130194">The results didn't clean our air in a measurable sense, ergo, nobody gets counsel fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.983" offset="7155794">I don't really think the government means to argue that ultimately.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.045" offset="7168019">The point is, the legislative history shows that it would be in the public interest, as Congress saw it, to permit judicial review of rulemaking on a timely basis, a 60-day statute of limitations, and they encourage private individuals and institutions with lawyers to come in and do this and to even get paid when they lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.144" offset="7280450">And the Court of Appeals, in this case, saw that point, as did the First Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.814" offset="7303124">Congress saw the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.749" offset="7310856">You see, the government keeps trying to tie us in to the legislative history of 304 in 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.450" offset="7341681">There's a good reason for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.294" offset="7348995">They don't want to see anything develop to indicate and anticipate and take care of what happened in the year 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.239" offset="7384835">They want to treat this as if it's an old fashioned, simple litigation, or even a fairly modern, simple litigation, like an abatement case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.160" offset="7432483">Of course this isn't an abatement case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.578" offset="7442096">They also suggest that private parties could be defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.579" offset="7458187">Section 307 suits, I'm sure Ms. Oberly misspoke.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.577" offset="7474174">She knows that you cannot be a defendant if you're a private party in a 307 petition for review unless you are brought in as an intervenor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.040" offset="7520045">So that, conceding that the history is not clear, as either the government would like or the respondents would like, we argue the balance tips in favor of what the Court of Appeals did in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.802" offset="7575007">Now, the government also likes to downplay this case and say, well you know, there really weren't that much happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.640" offset="7606354">It began, all in '79, it was routine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.404" offset="7629446">It's a little more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.373" offset="7637283">Back in 1973, groups out in the west began to be concerned about emissions of sulphur dioxide, particularly in the western coal-fired utility plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.116" offset="7688274">It is true, as the government says, that in 1975 was really the formal kickoff, but there's been a long and tortuous history, not only under the banner or case name of the case that we're here before you this morning, but in a case before Judge Skelly Wright in 1975, as I recall, brought by some of the Indian tribes, raising this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.124" offset="7788375">We're talking in this case about an issue that engendered a simply enormous, complex record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.338" offset="7817214">It's also a little bit disingenuous, it seems to me, to argue that these people who came in here for the Sierra Club, particularly in terms of the merits issues and then later EDF, in terms of the administrative law issues which were settled in this case, to say that nobody won anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.423" offset="7909478">Obviously there was the win in the sense that the public, in the broad sense, had somebody coming in to petition for review where you had a brand new Section 111 of the 1977 Act dealing with standards for emissions of sulphur dioxide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.507" offset="7997877">And one of the great issues that was resolved here, and it wasn't an easy issue, and the Court, contrary to the government's position, said it wasn't an easy issue, and that was the variable standards, west as opposed to east, for emissions of coal-fired utility smokestacks.</text>

            <text syncTime="2237.740" offset="9082794">I have to concede that, but if you analyze the interplay between what happened in 1970, particularly in courts, then what happened in the Congress, in such evidence as we have... obviously both Ms. Oberly and I both would agree we'd like, from our respective points of view, to have clearer statements, but we say the only fair construction is that Congress wanted to encourage this type of litigation and recognized that the way to do it was to hold out that in certain cases, not all, even if you lost, you'd get paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.707" offset="9250709">Now let me add to that something which I think is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.927" offset="9263562">The government may be arguing, among others, that it is poor policy to encourage suits by paying losers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.622" offset="9318314">Now, of course, none of us, I assume, certainly in our briefs we don't have any studies to show whether this is true or not, but let me say that I think that Congress was aware in 1977, and indeed even back in '70, that you'll get frivolous lawsuits no matter what you do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.052" offset="9412042">And my answer to that is, look, if judges can't smell out frivolous lawsuits, I will be surprised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.721" offset="9442762">So that the next step to go with, and I think the government may be trying to say this is, that if you have a statute permitting payment of losers, you may get more frivolous lawsuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.590" offset="9494171">I don't believe that's true and I think human experience proves it's not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.292" offset="9512979">It's better to encourage, particularly citizens and groups who know something about environmental problems, to come in and petition for review and get payment, in appropriate cases only, where they lose, than to discourage them totally so that they won't even bring petitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.548" offset="9598034">And finally, let me make another point here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.938" offset="9607542">The government says, with some plausible record basis for it, that the problem is that Congress didn't flesh out the words where or when appropriate and that, of course, is literally true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.664" offset="9682461">But our argument on that is understandable to you all, I'm sure, and it is simply that courts have long, whether federal, state or local on whatever issue, been able to exercise discretion with even less precision than this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.439" offset="9749544">And a good example is the cases here in this Circuit, which, of course, is where you're going to get most of the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.842" offset="9775248">Following our case, there was on the same day, an eloquent dissent by Judge Wilkey in Alabama Power in which he said that when appropriate was very vague and it put the court in the political thicket and so on and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.537" offset="9842017">Time passes and in a case which sometimes lawyers refer to as North Slope v. Andrus, or as in our briefs is called, Village of Kaktovik v. Watt, Judge Wilkey himself accurately summed up the holding of the panel in this case, applied those rules, if you will, or those criteria; came to the conclusion that in that case the losers did not deserve to win, parsing out all of the criteria that would make sense to any judge or court that ever has fixed fees on any basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.320" offset="10009096">Therefore, we sum up and say to Your Honors that this is a case where Congress clearly intended to say under the appropriate circumstances, subject to the sound discretion of the fee fixing panel or court, there can be fees paid in these environmental cases, even where there has been a technical loss on petitions for judicial review.</text>

            <text syncTime="2600.500" offset="10533844">A few points, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.672" offset="10542517">Mr. Tyler accuses the government of focusing on the 1970 Act and trying to ignore what happened between 1970 and 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.087" offset="10588179">But, in fact, the language of the two statutes is, word for word, identical, and the Senate report in 1977 indicates that all Congress wanted to do in 1977 was conform the two sections so that they would mean the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.156" offset="10660486">So, we think it's clear that the 1970 legislative history is the relevant legislative history that the court has to examine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.577" offset="10690161">There is one other final point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.702" offset="10698625">I'd like to say that we disagree strongly with respondents that Congress has evidenced an intent to encourage litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.449" offset="10733629">Congress has made it possible for citizen groups to litigate when they want to and has done so by providing that they'll be paid if they actually accomplish something, but we have read the legislative history in the statute from one end to the other and find no evidence that Congress was trying to increase litigation or to encourage litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.673" offset="10822549">I'd also point out that civil rights plaintiffs who have to prevail in their statutes have not been discouraged from bringing cases by the requirement of prevailing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.028" offset="10859957">To say that Congress wants to encourage litigation is really to say something that has never been said on the floor of the Congress.</text>
