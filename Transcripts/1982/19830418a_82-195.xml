            <text syncTime="682.399" offset="2878630">Although Minnesota points to a broad class that benefits in theory from the deduction, the deductible non-tuition expenses are plainly insignificant in relation to tuition.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.942" offset="2932756">As the First Circuit indicated in the Norberg case, they are a mere window dressing.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.580" offset="2955325">Any lack of evidence on this point results from the choice by the state not to require taxpayers to disclose the specific nature of the expenses deducted as the forms appended to the briefs make quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.494" offset="3022930">Even without that information, however, the facial availability of the tuition deduction only puts sectarian students into a very small number of non-sectarian private school students suffices to establish impermissible effect under Nyquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.956" offset="3088863">With regard to the lack of restrictions on the aid, the subsidy resultant from this deduction is without restriction and thereby falls afoul of the limits created in Lemon and Nyquist.</text>

            <text syncTime="883.194" offset="3681739">There is nothing in this statute that restricts the deductibility of field trips, tests, maps, globes, instruction materials or religious instruction itself through the tuition deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.484" offset="3746940">To allow this pirouette around Lemon and Nyquist is to render them meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.436" offset="3766689">Just as states may not provide direct aid to religious schools, they may not provide such aid indirectly by tax deductions and credits, as I believe Nyquist so firmly held.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.197" offset="3809739">With regard to the fee for service, I believe that the Court held in Nyquist the deduction of fees for services is a direct subsidy of the service, as I indicated previously, in effect, a discount or rebate.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.752" offset="3879956">This is, I believe, directly analogous to the medical services deduction which parenthetically Congress has recently reduced in order to reduce the amount of medical care consumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.639" offset="3931574">The comparison would be to take the other forms of medical subsidy and compare them to that form of subsidy for religion present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.242" offset="3977967">That is to say Medicare and Medicaid are direct subsidies of health services.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.787" offset="4004090">If the State of Minnesota were to fund a program similar to Medicare and Medicaid for religious education, quite clearly under the Lemon case this Court would strike it down.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.079" offset="4045259">The effect then of this statute is the same as in Nyquist; that is to say the taxpayer acts in either case in anticipation of receiving the benefit of the deduction, thereby subsidizing attendance at a religious school by deducting the fees charged for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.383" offset="4126552">Lastly, this deduction impermissibly entangles the state in religion in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.396" offset="4158525">First, if the state were to undertake the duty Tilton and Lemon establish of insuring that expenses deducted are not for services or materials used in the teaching of religious tenants, then comprehensively entangling audits of tax returns would be required, a task the state has quite obviously already failed at as even a cursory examination of the Minnesota tax returns were revealed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1596.022" offset="6533056">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.926" offset="6544654">The issue in this case is whether by exempting that portion of a taxpayer's income which has been devoted to the general educational expenses of his or her children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.501" offset="6590943">The State of Minnesota has adopted legislation respecting the establishment of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.389" offset="6614558">The statute was adopted in 1955 and, as Mr. Justice Powell's questions elicited, it was amended in 1976 to include within the ambit of the deductions certain textbooks and materials which before that time were not covered by the deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.413" offset="6682685">It was again amended in 1978 to assure that the deduction was taken for those expenses related to curricular activities rather than extracurricular activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.472" offset="6722914">The challenged deduction does not result in a straight $500 benefit or a straight $700 benefit, rather it constitutes a deduction against the income of a taxpayer in calculating taxable income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.605" offset="6791459">As a matter of fact--</text>

            <text syncTime="1669.103" offset="6825419">And, it is that broad class of beneficiaries which we have said is a crucial part of this particular deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.207" offset="6869827">It was that point which was relied upon by the three judge district panel which upheld this statute originally in 1978 and by the District Court and the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals which upheld it again when it was challenged in 1980.</text>

            <text syncTime="1713.350" offset="7002424">The question of whether or not a statute provides direct assistance is crucial because it is that type of assistance which denotes sponsorship, advancement, a relationship between the state and the religious institutions of the state which is one of sponsor and sponsored.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.781" offset="7076090">It is also a symbolic matter that this Court recognized in Grendel's Den whether or not then state has entered into a sponsorship relationship with religion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2080.343" offset="8470401">The provision of a deduction in that particular case, however, doesn't provide any state sponsorship of those expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.512" offset="8511048">There is no money being transferred out of the legislature here so that those things will be provided.</text>

            <text syncTime="2110.034" offset="8589102">It is also important to know that under Section 170, a wealthy benefactor might buy these same materials, receive a deduction for them and make them available to those attending sectarian schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.967" offset="8636854">There the Court, it appears to me, is not likely to say that that would constitute state or federal sponsorship.</text>

            <text syncTime="2143.397" offset="8722535">There are also benefits available to public school students under that textbook expenditure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.688" offset="8763704">As we have indicated, materials such as personal items, personal physical education items, and it is this type of expenditure that is not taken into consideration by the statistics that the plaintiffs have presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.386" offset="8826503">They assume in all their briefs below and in the brief before this Court that any benefit to those attending public schools must be de minimus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.617" offset="8855446">But, there are about 800,000 public school students and if a small percentage of those people took deductions for relatively minor amounts, the statistical analysis would be completely different, vastly different, than what has been presented by the plaintiffs so far.</text>

            <text syncTime="2230.782" offset="9072158">It is also a legislative recognition that the income devoted to educating one's child does constitute a drain which can equitably and reasonably be recognized by the legislature in identifying taxable income much the same way when you expend money on medical assistance or things of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.227" offset="9153869">The legislature is going to recognize that in calculating taxable income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.523" offset="9175081">So that there are benefits and the purpose of the statute is pursued to the extent that there are benefits available for public school students as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="2287.901" offset="9300573">Many of the cases that this Court has reviewed and many of the types of programs that it has already upheld relate solely to those people attending private schools, non-public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.474" offset="9346862">A very good example most recently are those benefits that were available to the non-public schools in the Regan case where reimbursements for taking attendance, for administering tests, for grading tests were all valid and that is even where you have a purpose that is clearly aimed only at non-public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.276" offset="9454068">I don't think that is the case with regard to this particular statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.416" offset="9470682">The plaintiffs do suggest that in a 1976 Revenue Memorandum prepared by a staff member of the Department of Revenue, and it is dated several days after the effective date of the legislature, but I understand there was one before the effective date of the law, but it is my understanding that there was another one floating around before that time, suggests that the benefits are only available to those attending non-public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.406" offset="9570574">That memorandum represents an attempt by the Revenue Department to say these are the figures we can get, we are going to assume it is only for tuition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.497" offset="9606937">If there is anything that showed what actually is going on and what their effect of the statute is it is going to be the more recent data submitted by the Revenue Department which, as the Justice Department's amicus brief indicates, over 204,000 dependents were represented by that deduction and at that time there were only about 90,000 sectarian students.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.755" offset="9688021">So that the majority of those people taking the deduction are actually not attending sectarian schools.</text>

            <text syncTime="2601.778" offset="10556122">In Walz it was particularly important that religious institutions fell inside a broader class of non-profit institutions and this case essentially presents the issue of whether or not Walz were limited only to educational institutions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2713.811" offset="11004279">But, it is impossible to identify a constitutionally significant difference in those.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.200" offset="11025804">If, for instance, the purpose of the Establishment Clause is to make sure that the state does not enter into a relationship of sponsorship with a church, then the user fee analysis that the plaintiffs put forth distinguishes between the Section 170 type of direct payment to religious institutions for obviously religious purposes, the building of buildings and payment of fees to clergy, things of that sort, and makes that valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.766" offset="11136041">It makes it invalid for persons to pay tuition to an institution that provides education to his or her child or if, for instance, we were to say that the Establishment Clause's purpose was to make sure that no one is taxed in order to support a religion other than of their own choosing, we find that the user fee analysis makes another decision that bears no relationship to the Establishment Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.758" offset="11224021">What it does is to say that equally indirect benefits to individuals and to institutions are somehow different under that purpose and permits one and invalidates the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.705" offset="11279819">The plaintiffs use of statistics is also difficult in this particular case, difficult to identify the reasons for which it is material to Establishment Clause analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.651" offset="11355574">Their statistics indicate that about 10 % of those attending schools attend sectarian schools in Minnesota and Mr. Justice Powell requested some information about the percentage of those people attending schools earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.627" offset="11431538">It is my understanding that the early statistics for which they know the percentage of sectarian students.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.375" offset="11454525">It is about 1959 to 1960 according to education data which is issued every March.</text>

            <text syncTime="2966.288" offset="12014173">But, ultimately... Ultimately, details concerning what particular group of people benefited more or were the predominate beneficiaries under the particular statute is, in our estimation and in the estimation of the District Court and the Court of Appeals, irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.032" offset="12085121">It is not material to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.452" offset="12090764">For instance, if we were to look at which organizations or group of organizations was the predominate beneficiary under Section 170, historically we would find that religious institutions took the bulk of deductions or the contributions to religious institutions received the bulk of deductions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.649" offset="12167564">Similarly, I would suspect, although I am not certain, that religious institutions are also the predominant beneficiaries under Walz style property tax exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.580" offset="12207270">But, those facts are not going to be sufficient to hold that that property tax exemption in Walz or Section 170 of the Internal Revenue Code are unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.186" offset="12245722">The reason is that the... The Establishment Clause requires that religious institutions and those associated with religious groups be treated neutrally; that they not be hindered, that they not be advanced, but the Establishment Clause does not require that religious institutions always come out second best or religious always come out second best under any neutral set of criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.615" offset="12343420">The plaintiffs have also suggested that it is important in this case that there is no restriction on the tuition fees which may be paid or the textbooks... Excuse me, the transportation uses which will qualify for deductions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.074" offset="12429311">They suggest that because you cannot identify the secular from the sectarian or because the statute doesn't attempt to identify the secular from the sectarian that it is unconstitutional; that we either have a primary effect problem or we are going to have an entanglement problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.788" offset="12484168">The fact is, however, that those types of... that type of separation is very important when you have direct state assistance, money or goods flowing out of the treasury to individuals or to religious institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.062" offset="12537249">When you supply textbooks, when you supply equipment, it is important because of the symbolic sponsorship problem that may arise, that institutions not receive assistance to clearly sectarian activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.713" offset="12595867">But, we recognize in Walz and under Section 170 that tax deductions are going to be available for people who make direct payments to the institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.570" offset="12631290">As I have indicated before, Section 170 would permit an individual to supply textbooks, supply Bibles, supply buses to private schools and take a deduction for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.579" offset="12687296">Yet, if individuals purchase that sort of equipment, that sort of transportation from an institution and spend their own money in much the same way a contributor might, that is going to be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.401" offset="12746646">The difference between them seems to be impossible to reconcile with the purposes of the Establishment Clause, to avoid the sponsorship or the symbolic appearance of sponsorship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.084" offset="12793353">It is also difficult to identify the source of the petitioners' indication that $17 million in revenue loss is attributable to this deduction for the biennial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.125" offset="12853539">I am not certain where the figure came from.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.811" offset="12864197">I do know that the Revenue Department estimated for 1980 it was about $4.1 million.</text>

            <text syncTime="3215.905" offset="13012573">So, the legislature anticipates expenditures of approximately 1.2 billion or in excess of a billion dollars for public education.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.495" offset="13054996">I am not certain of the actual appropriated funds, because the appropriation says as much money as necessary will be transferred from the treasury to pay foundation aid.</text>

            <text syncTime="3283.425" offset="13282679">I think it is important to draw the distinction between Nyquist and this case because the Nyquist distinctions go to the very heart of the Establishment Clause jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.234" offset="13317892">The Nyquist case involved benefits where the legislature had identified specific amounts of money it wanted to make available to individuals who had enrolled their children in private, predominately sectarian schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.086" offset="13381317">It represents a legislative determination that for performing a specific act a specific amount of money is going to be provided to individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.052" offset="13421232">In order to achieve that result, a particularly... what shall we say... detailed form of tax table was provided so that if you had an income of less than "X" amount, you were to take... exempt from your income a particular amount regardless of whether that was more or less or any relationship to what you pay to a particular institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.932" offset="13528752">Now, it is that kind of relationship, the fundamental decision of a legislature to benefit particular individuals for particular acts, which is important to Establishment Clause analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.161" offset="13573683">It is also important that the only group who could benefit under the Nyquist provision were those in private schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.439" offset="13602731">There were no benefits.</text>

            <text syncTime="3378.089" offset="13661350">And, it is this singling out of a particular group for benefits which are not available across the board, which shows that benefits to religious institutions were not incidental, which shows that there may be problems of political divisiveness, because groups being formed along private lines which become predominately sectarian lines.</text>

            <text syncTime="3467.740" offset="14019959">Mr. Kampf, on these statistics that have been discussed, suppose a case was before the Court with a record that showed that 60 % of all the people in the state under a statute like this were in private schools, some of which were non-denominational, non-church sponsored, and some church sponsored.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.072" offset="14145242">What would your view be of the statute then?</text>

            <label>Mr. William I. Kampf</label>
            <text syncTime="3502.102" offset="14157363">Well, at that point, one would have to determine whether the primary effect of the statute was, indeed, to aid the religious schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.038" offset="14193099">That is not the facts before us and I believe that the question is capability of diversion and restriction or lack of it in the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3520.328" offset="14230297">Well, what about my hypothetical?</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.702" offset="14239805">We often ask hypothetical questions just to test the argument.</text>

            <label>Mr. William I. Kampf</label>
            <text syncTime="3526.076" offset="14253285">As I recall, the same question was asked in the Nyquist argument and I think the answer is less than comforting since I am not sure that that hypothetical exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.026" offset="14293095">Nevertheless, ultimately, since there is no restriction on the subsidy inherent in the statute, it runs into the same problem, which is that it is capable of diversion to religious function.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.616" offset="14343459">Speaking of the deductions, I should point out that the table, which is appended to the State's brief, has an analysis of the number of returns by amount of deduction appended to it and that a clear reading of that same table, as we indicated in Footnote Three of our reply brief, indicates that the greatest proportion of the dollars deducted was in the higher dollar ranges, thereby benefiting, quite obviously, tuition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.025" offset="14457040">There were, as Mr. Justice Stevens indicated, a large number of returns taking small numbers of tuitions, tuition deductions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.943" offset="14488805">This is quite clearly analogous to the Wolman decision where the Court sorted amongst kind of aid as in Meek and disallowed some and allowed others.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.970" offset="14536870">The tuition deduction itself must clearly fall because it is a benefit to the religious institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.249" offset="14569993">It is a subsidy.</text>
