            <text syncTime="9.841" offset="131594">This case comes to us from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.806" offset="151447">It involves a question under the labor laws concerning picketing in a shopping center.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.844" offset="175584">A union that was -- represented employees that were working under construction of a new store were engaged in labor dispute with the owner of the store to be built.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.033" offset="232427">And in order to explain this to the public, they did some handbilling at the shopping center and urged the numbers to the public not to patronize any stores in the shopping center and the owner of the shopping center brought a -- filed a charge with the Labor Board claiming this was an unlawful secondary boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.406" offset="313929">The case presents three questions whether the statute itself is violated and if there is a violation, is the violation excused because the picketing comes within what is known as the publicity proviso, and thirdly, would it be protected by the First Amendment to the federal constitution even if it violated the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.226" offset="397207">The Court of Appeals held that the publicity proviso protected picketing and we have reviewed that portion of the case and decided the Court of Appeals was wrong that the publicity proviso is not a protection and therefore, we remanded the case for consideration of the other two issues and the opinion is unanimous.</text>
