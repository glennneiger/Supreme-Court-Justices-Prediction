            <text syncTime="76.875" offset="438058">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.342" offset="451955">The issue in this case is whether the voluntary acceptance of compensation plus the filing and review of certain documents by the Deputy Commissioner is sufficient to trigger the assignment provisions of Section 33(b) of the Longshoremen's and Harborworker's Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.817" offset="553833">Secondarily, whether under the circumstances of this case there is a conflict of interest which, between the employer and the employee, which would preclude an assignment under Section 33(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="128.089" offset="642962">It is the petitioner's position in this case that the Sixth Circuit Decision is erroneous, that it misapplied the law as it relates to Section 33(b) and applied... relied to a great extent upon conflict of interest principles which this court has held are not applicable in the classic situation that exists between the longshoreman and his employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.699" offset="789353">I would like to discuss just briefly the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.807" offset="805862">Mr. Duris was injured in May of 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.164" offset="831253">Shortly thereafter the stevedore employer commenced benefits to Mr. Duris which were paid either bi-weekly or weekly for a period of two years through April 28, 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.844" offset="909934">At that time, Mr. Duris had recovered and returned to work and payments were stopped or suspended and a form filed with the Department of Labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.134" offset="975136">We also know, at this point, in time that during the intervening period, or during that period between '75 and '77, that there was a formal claim filed by Mr. Duris and certain other informal conferences, or a conference held with all of the parties represented.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.280" offset="1067713">On April 8, 1980, the lawsuit with which we are here concerned was commenced and on Februay 25, 1983, Duris received a final award.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.116" offset="1147021">Throughout the entire compensation proceedings and otherwise, Duris has been represented by competent counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.097" offset="1186936">I would like, at this point, to give you an overview of what our argument is going to be in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.983" offset="1218492">It is petitioner's contention, first, that Section 33(b) of the Act contemplates an assignment in each and every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.713" offset="1265408">Secondly, that the congressional hearings at the time of the amendments indicate that the assignment should take place within a reasonable time after the inception of each claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.176" offset="1327266">Third, that formal compensation orders are not required to constitute an award.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.813" offset="1361852">Four, I think it is important that the quid pro quo of the Act be maintained in balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.263" offset="1399678">And five, that Congress, when it amended the Act, certainly did not contemplate eight years between injury and assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.226" offset="1459550">The Sixth Circuit's decision in this case, we submit, is erroneous in that it took an unduly restrictive approach to the question at hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.955" offset="1522453">The Sixth Circuit started its opinion and discussion of the legal issues by summarily disposing of two cases from another Circuit which it stated it simply would not follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.930" offset="1606358">These cases had held that some act of ratification of compensation plus the filing of documents and acceptance of compensation by the longshoreman was sufficient to constitute an award under the Act and specifically 33(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="397.091" offset="1718998">These same documents were filed of record in the Duris case and the court gave absolutely no consideration to them in considering whether there should have been an award.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.585" offset="1776886">As a matter of fact, I don't even find them mentioned in the opinion of the court.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="415.802" stopTime="430.531">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="415.802" offset="1793813">Mr. Carle, would you agree that the statutory term compensation order is a term of art as it's used elsewhere in the Longshoremen's and Harborworker's Act?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_d_carle_iii" startTime="430.531" stopTime="474.121">
            <label>Mr. William D. Carle, III</label>
            <text syncTime="430.531" offset="1852745">That troubles me on the term of art.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.306" offset="1903841">I don't believe it's a term of art, really, because you find as you read the act they use the term compensation order, they use the term order, depending upon what subject they're attempting to approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.236" offset="1987537">And I just hardly think that it's a term of art, at least in the sense that I understand what is meant by a term of art.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="474.121" stopTime="488.726">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="474.121" offset="2027034">I think the Solicitor General's brief indicated support for that concept and I wondered if that were true, why the same meaning wouldn't carry forward in Section 33(b).</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_d_carle_iii" startTime="488.726" stopTime="495.457">
            <label>Mr. William D. Carle, III</label>
            <text syncTime="488.726" offset="2085549">Well, it's certainly our contention that it don't.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="495.457" stopTime="543.719">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="495.457" offset="2112402">There doesn't seem to be any real reason why the term wouldn't mean the same thing in all sections, including this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.470" offset="2152527">And while I have you interrupted, I... the respondent and the Solicitor General's position indicate that all the respondent's employer had to do to ensure receipt of an award in a compensation order was to file a Notice of Controversion and request issuance of an award by the Deputy Commissioner and that it didn't require a full proceeding, but that it is possible to get an award by simply asking for it.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_d_carle_iii" startTime="543.719" stopTime="584.906">
            <label>Mr. William D. Carle, III</label>
            <text syncTime="543.719" offset="2305500">That, I don't believe, is quite correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.389" offset="2324203">The government does state in their brief that an award, they would seem to implicate, at any rate, that an award is very easy to obtain from the Department of Labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.524" offset="2380732">The award contemplates agreement between the parties and they simply, the formal award, such as was later entered in this case in February of 1983, simply does not come around quite that easy.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.875" offset="2466100">As a matter of fact--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="584.906" stopTime="606.428">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="584.906" offset="2470176">Well, this one came as a result of a formal hearing, which is one way to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.981" offset="2490551">But the position taken by the Solicitor General and the SG is that under the regulations of this Act, you don't have to go to a formal hearing, that the employer can simply ask for the formal award and will receive it.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_d_carle_iii" startTime="606.428" stopTime="1349.362">
            <label>Mr. William D. Carle, III</label>
            <text syncTime="606.428" offset="2556275">--I find no authority for that in the regulations or the Act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.800" offset="2577800">If the employer contravenes, he can obtain an award and really, when you analyze the Duris opinion, that is what the Duris opinion has to say, that you must contravene in order to obtain an award and our position is that that certainly is not necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.444" offset="2692425">Indeed, as I go through the argument, I would intend to submit that it's not even proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.332" offset="2723877">And we'll go on with that, as you'll see, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.296" offset="2775808">Just prior to disposing summarily of the two cases which were decided counter to what the Sixth Circuit was going to decide, the Sixth Circuit had this to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.962" offset="2838398">"The Act noted earlier makes purposeful use of the term award. "</text>
            <text syncTime="685.958" offset="2874447">"Thus, if benefits are paid without an award, there should be no assignment and no six-month limitation period. "</text>
            <text syncTime="697.720" offset="2921467">Now I can agree literally with what the court has stated here.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.622" offset="2953127">But I submit to interpret that and apply it to the Act as the court did in this case, is going to do extreme violence to the scheme of the Act and if the court would view the statistics compiled by the Department of Labor, which were lodged with the court by our amicus in this cases, you will see that only in two percent of the cases are formal compensation awards entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.308" offset="3119789">And that's disputed cases, and it's less than that in undisputed cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.947" offset="3142358">Now, we firmly believe that Congress intended that an award and assignment be issued in every case and we point to the 1972 amendments to the Act in which Congress extensively revised Section 905(b) with respect to third party liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.357" offset="3263985">And in that revision, Congress stated that the third party liability action is to be brought in</text>
            <text syncTime="794.571" offset="3308915">"accordance with the provisions of Section 33(b). "</text>
            <text syncTime="799.568" offset="3328873">Furthermore, the quid pro quo of the act certainly gives the employer, we contend, the right to review independently all of his cases and determine whether he wants to bring a third party action.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.700" offset="3417376">It's also clear, we believe, that if the employer is going to lose this right, he has indeed lost a valuable right.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.585" offset="3476935">When we look at Section 33 as a whole, because there's the election and then the assignment and then some other sections, but when we look at that as a whole, we'll find that Sections (a) and (b) of Section 33 certainly give the employee and employer both a cause of action, at least by implication, certainly to the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.323" offset="3599919">And for certain in Section, I believe it's (d), gives the employer a cause of action for recovery under the Act of his compensation loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.569" offset="3656866">Now, if that is the case, then certainly this statute contemplates an assignment in each and every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.750" offset="3717575">The conditional understanding that employer and employee would have consecutive rights to each third party action is implicit, we believe, in the hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.618" offset="3785075">Now, the Sixth Circuit, having said that in the case of voluntary payments there could be no assignment... no award and no assignment, thus no assignment, or no six month limitation period, realized that they had to come up with something for this poor employer, who is left with his compensation payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.480" offset="3904507">And in the event the employee did not sue a third party, he had no way to recover them.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.319" offset="3943900">So, the Sixth Circuit said, all right, we'll give him a Burnside remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.585" offset="3960931">The Burnside remedy stems from a case decided by this court back in 1969 in which a tort action was permitted to the stevedore in order to permit him to recover other than under Section 33 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.608" offset="4033029">So, they came up with this Burnside remedy, injected it into the case, and said Mr. Employer, you've got your remedy, while we, on the petitioner's side, question the existence or nonexistence, whether the existence or nonexistence of this nonstatutory cause of action is relevant to these proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.720" offset="4157477">Nevertheless, certainly the viability of Burnside today is extremely questionable in view, again, of the extensive revision to Section 905(b), third party liability Section of the Act with its exclusivity language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.555" offset="4244830">Furthermore, I find it extremely hard to rationalize, in my mind, that any employer today would want a tort-only cause of action for recovery of his compensation loss or other damages in which he would be subjected to the possibility, at least, will he be subjected to the proportional fault recovery in the case, and possibly no recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.602" offset="4392997">Next, the Sixth Circuit in Duris hit on the controversion issue, which I was discussing a few moments ago with Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.142" offset="4463214">The court expressed the view, with respect to controversion that by the employer controverting the claim, that it would bring the employee into contact with the statutes which would, in turn, make the employee aware of the assignment provision and then, in view of its previous statement, which I quoted earlier, indicated that the only true way in which an award could be obtained in a 33(b) action would be via contravention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.839" offset="4665924">We suggest that the Sixth's Circuit's reasoning is faulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.448" offset="4684419">Certainly the regulations contemplate the informal administration of this Act and to minimize contravention and/or hearings which would be held as a result thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.502" offset="4764562">What, I think, the court neglected to consider is that when you controvert a claim, you controvert the right to receive compensation and under the Act, Section 14 and Section 19, in order... well, both provide that this will happen early on in the handling of any particular case within 14 days under Section 14 and within 14 days under Section 19.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.955" offset="4926417">But, in any event, if you controvert, it's going to happen early on in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.906" offset="4950241">It will admittedly result in a hearing and award.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.138" offset="4971139">Now, how controversion is going to make the employee cognizant of his rights under the statutes and, in particular, his rights under the assignment provision, is certainly a mystery to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.332" offset="5055880">The smooth operation of the act, we submit, should not call for contravention by the employer on each and every case in order to obtain this award and, indeed, as I suggested previously, we feel it may be highly improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.182" offset="5147309">Next, the court considered the conflict of interest question and pointed to the disincentive on the part of the employer to bring suit under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.581" offset="5224945">The Sixth Circuit stated</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.970" offset="5234453">"this conflict of interest problem makes us hesitate to countenance any interpretation of the Act which would expand the assignment provision of Section 33. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.324" offset="5295893">We submit that the underlying reason given by the court, mainly conflict of interest, will not legally Justify its conclusion with respect to an expanded interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.831" offset="5377918">This court considered an identical argument, conflict of interests, business relationship, in its recent decision in Rodriguez and rejected it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.652" offset="5449180">We submit that the Sixth Circuit's reasoning in the Duris opinion simply cannot be sustained on sound legal principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.411" offset="5504246">I'd like, at this point, to discuss, for a short time, the history of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1994.074" offset="8106878">Liberty Mutual is based upon unique facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.525" offset="8116700">It was a situation where literally the longshoremen got together with the ship owner and made a settlement, left out the lien and the rights of the equitable maritime under general maritime law lien of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.802" offset="8165810">The court, in an effort to remedy that law, went about seeking out proper... the proper thing to do, but unfortunately in the wrong method, and they pursued the case from the standpoint that they wanted to get that payment back to the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.312" offset="8215860">Therefore, they came up with the idea that mere acceptance of compensation under an award and certain acts of ratification, that meaning that there were some informal hearings, would constitute what they felt was an award in the compensation order.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas W. Gallagher</label>
            <text syncTime="2045.052" offset="8310842">I think that the situation is such that the longshoremen really follow what the dictations of the law are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.222" offset="8331531">They get prompt compensation under the no-fault provisions of the Act and they're satisfied to a certain extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.720" offset="8353473">Then they seek counsel and then pursue their remedies once they're advised just what they are, both by word of mouth and then onward to see an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.481" offset="8380536">But it's very unusual for them to contact the shipowner or his carrier, from the standpoint that he just doesn't have access to them unless there's potentially an insurance adjustor involved who perhaps would contact him directly and that would put up the red flag that he should seek counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.103" offset="8431005">So I submit to you that it's very rare, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.882" offset="8442081">It also brings up another important point, though, from the standpoint that when you have a situation where an individual is injured and if we were to construe the statute to be just what this says it is... just what the petitioners are desirous of having it say, the longshoreman really only has six months and 14 days within which to bring an action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.140" offset="8515119">I submit to you that's woefully inadequate and Congress recognized it to be just that, woefully inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.762" offset="8537689">The problem is, if he were to come to me and if that was the law, I'd have to say to him, we have to file suit right now and I have to attach interrogatories to my complaint to seek out if there's any other individual who may responsible for your injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.728" offset="8589516">By that, I mean a case just like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.289" offset="8599756">Joseph Duris was injured in May of 1975 while acting in his capacity as a longshoreman, but the shipowner wasn't the primary defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.988" offset="8634551">The primary defendant was a bare boat charter and I, as trial counsel, would have to advise my client, we've got to get that suit on right now and find out if there is somebody else, if there's a dry boat or bare boat charter whom we really should be suing, or you may find that if we don't file in time and have the right party, then you're totally lost as far as the third party liability aspect of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.542" offset="8716785">So that short statute, the construction which the petitioners submit, is a very dangerous proposition for the longshoreman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.337" offset="8743952">As I've mentioned, unfortunately, we're, excuse me, dealing with a situation where the Liberty Mutual case started this series of cases indicating that mere compensation was mere sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.754" offset="8789614">And that was even expanded upon, unfortunately, by the Simmons case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.222" offset="8803511">And the Simmons case, they went even one step further in setting up their three-pronged test, which is outlined in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.170" offset="8831305">The unfortunate aspect of that three-pronged test is that the very second element of that test is to the effect that when the employer's form LS-206 is filed, that is one of the elements under which the triggering mechanism for the statute becomes applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.181" offset="8899328">Again, the same bugaboo, the same problem, the same area of concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.287" offset="8919704">The longshoreman is told that a payment without an award on a form, taking the petitioner's standpoint, is truly payment under an award.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.784" offset="8957738">Under such circumstance he'd have to take immediate action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.595" offset="8969023">Following an interpretation such as this, you're going to flood the courts with lawsuits, because we've got to get them out in time, we're going to have to move quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.653" offset="8997235">Also, going on from the sentence court, the Second Circuit, to a certain extent, got in on the act from the standpoint that they also interpreted somewhat less accurately what the statute actually says.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.868" offset="9054078">The Second Circuit maintained that Liberty Mutual was in error, that there's no way that the longshoreman should have the responsibility of picking up and defining his rights so quickly, as Liberty Mutual required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.707" offset="9097441">But they stated that you should have a situation where it arises that the longshoreman has access to all of the information available to him relative to what the award would or would not be, in its total, so that he would have to have an understanding of the totality of the benefits applicable to him before he should make such an award.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.558" offset="9176853">Unfortunately, they also, although holding that in that fashion, neglected to truly look at the statute and make the determination that the statutory wording is mandatory and is unequivocal and requires one thing, the condition precedent that there be, in each and every case when the assignment provisions are to become effective, an award in a compensation order filed by the Deputy Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.798" offset="9269745">The significance of that is that the award in a compensation order is a definable entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.921" offset="9294300">It is mentioned in several parts throughout the statute, Section 914(e) and (f), particularly in point from the standpoint that it sets up specific penalty provisions pending upon which actions the employers take.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.117" offset="9355113">Employers, from a practical standpoint, are not, I mean from a day to day standpoint, are not particularly interested, they're in no rush to have that assignment accrued to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.441" offset="9396386">They've got a benefit by this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.379" offset="9404118">And that benefit is, they can sit on the coattails of the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.674" offset="9421255">They have, under general maritime law, an equitable lien which allows them to obtain back out of the third party suit any monies paid to that employee under the no-fault provisions of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.075" offset="9478933">So they don't have to go offending their potential customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.182" offset="9491367">They don't have to do anything other than wait it out, if he's going to pursue it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.196" offset="9507354">And that, indeed, has happened in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.648" offset="9517176">For several years now, the unfortunate status of this litigation being in the appellate courts, and at the trial court level, where we haven't reached it on the merits as yet, I still have been receiving and coordinating information with the insurance carrier for the employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.377" offset="9580079">They know that we are protecting their lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.906" offset="9590215">I submit to you a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.094" offset="9598992">What if this court should decide to follow Liberty Mutual?</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.795" offset="9613829">What really happens to the employer, actually, his insurance carrier, who by statute is subjugated to his interest?</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.714" offset="9641415">What happens to him is that he's faced with a vigorous defense from these same petitioners and a defense of Laches.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.837" offset="9665970">Sure, it's been a long time since this man was injured and since those payments were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.631" offset="9685091">Very often it takes a long time to define what impact on your life a serious injury has occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.582" offset="9712886">The employer would be subjected to a situation where he is ultimately going to enmeshed in litigation to defend when he has relied on his interpretation of the law, like we have, pursuing the action in this fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.014" offset="9762623">The legislative history is also indicative of the intent of Congress that this wording be clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.636" offset="9805150">Since 1938, the courts, I submit to your case of American Stevedores v. Porello, holding that mere compensation is not sufficient to trigger the statute of limitations, is still good, valid and viable law today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.020" offset="9858649">The wording that I'm referring to, the award in a compensation order filed by a Deputy Commissioner, had not been changed by Congress in any of the three times this Act has been amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.313" offset="9903893">Strike that, I mean the two, since it was put into the Act in 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.514" offset="9920611">It was thoroughly reviewed in 1959 and at those legislative hearings it was even pointed out that Congress was very interested in the state of the judicial interpretation of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.510" offset="9960631">They liked what they saw.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.228" offset="9967527">They liked what this court was doing and what the appellate courts and circuit courts were doing, because they were interpreting the law as it was and as it is today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.632" offset="9997098">So also in 1972 when they amended this Section of the statute again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.317" offset="10015906">They didn't touch this wording.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.159" offset="10023220">This wording provided the condition precedent upon which an employer would take action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.001" offset="10046626">And until it was effectuated, there was no need for the employee to take action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.905" offset="10062195">I submit to you that in the reply brief of the petitioners, they saw the infirmities of their arguments relative to the Fourth Circuit and the Second Circuit and they came up with a new theory, that being that Section 919(c) of the Act does not apply to strictly controverted claims, that it applies in all cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.382" offset="10148086">A careful review of that statute will reflect that that's just not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.504" offset="10164595">Section 919(c) reflects only, and is applicable only, to those cases where there is a controversion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.705" offset="10189464">And the controversion concept's important, too, from the standpoint as mentioned by Mr. Carle earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.079" offset="10210884">They maintain that the employer must controvert every claim in order to get his assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.106" offset="10235021">Number one, he's not that interested in that assignment to begin with, if there's a third party liability claim because he's going to watch the suit of the longshoreman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.198" offset="10263338">Number two, the situation is such that he doesn't need to pursue the matter, because of that action, and at the same time he has his own rights under the Burnside decision of a general maritime action over against the shipowner, should he desire to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.880" offset="10326136">That case, which has been attacked by the petitioners, is still valid law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.502" offset="10344631">This court in Cindia Steamship Lines v. Delasantos left open the fact that the shipowner still has a duty to a longshoreman and if he breaches that duty, he would have to be subjected to a third party suit, or can be subjected to a third part suit directly from the longshoreman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.683" offset="10417356">So therefore, that Notice of Contravention, the active participation of the longshoreman in contravening is not that necessary from a simple standpoint that if, at any time, he's worried about his compensation benefits, the fact that he's put this money out and hasn't got it back yet, he can, at any time, voluntarily indicate to the Deputy Commissioner that he wants an award.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.877" offset="10502097">That is 19(c)... 919(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.376" offset="10516099">The Code of Federal Regulations also provides for that interpretation and that is, that promulgated by the Secretary of Labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.528" offset="10544729">I submit to you that another review of the Code of Federal Regulations will also reflect the fact that there are procedures which are applicable to this case and other longshoreman cases like it from the standpoint that these hearings are to be informal in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.022" offset="10606691">It's important to consider the whole concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.460" offset="10616409">The Longshoremen Act is a comprehensive scheme to take care of the longshoreman first.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.582" offset="10644935">He's the primary beneficiary of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.799" offset="10653816">Secondly, the employer, to try and get back the money he spent, if there is a third party who is liable, if there's a third party who's caused the injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.545" offset="10692791">Why harm the longshoreman and why harm the employer, and that's the idea behind the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.825" offset="10709927">I submit to you that if you take the narrow construction and ignore the statutory language that the petitioners desire, who benefits?</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.243" offset="10743573">Only one person and that's the shipowner, or the bare boat charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.571" offset="10760918">They get the benefit of the short statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.960" offset="10774398">They get the benefit of getting out of this picture soon, rapidly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.863" offset="10794042">And also, there's the trap that the longshoreman can make unwitting assignments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.486" offset="10812536">If you hit him with a long... with a very short statute of limitations you're facing the situation or prospect where he's not going to have the opportunity to decide for himself what needs to be done, if there is, indeed, the potential for a third party action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.700" offset="10865408">That is an incongruous and harsh result which this court has repeatedly attempted to avoid.</text>

            <text syncTime="2796.484" offset="11316491">That eight year comment made is strictly one only related to the fact that the injury occurred eight years ago.</text>

            <text syncTime="2838.217" offset="11483465">We look it as an assignment to know who has control of this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.730" offset="11509483">Supposedly, we're the third party tort-feasor, under Section 905.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.322" offset="11531844">We have a right to know, we think, who has the right to bring this cause of action in order to prevent multiplicity of litigation, which is what I thought we were trying to avoid, after the 1972 amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.892" offset="11602166">Now, there was, in this claim... in this particular case, a formal claim filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.467" offset="11636438">Unfortunately, it's not in the record of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.792" offset="11657754">It was only obtainable by us, just as a matter of fact before we wrote our reply brief, when the file was closed with the OWCP.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.930" offset="11698296">But it is there and Section 19 does apply to it and the notice to the employer is there, so that, really, any way you would look at this case, Mr. Duris is late, a long time late, in bringing his cause of action in 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.214" offset="11815429">Now, granted, he did have two previous causes of action, but those causes of action were gone by the time that this cause of action, with which we are here concerned, was run.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.770" offset="11869660">I want to say one more thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.317" offset="11875825">Congress, we feel, intended only a reasonable period of time in which to... in which the employee should be allowed to consider his options.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.623" offset="11941131">It certainly didn't consider eight years and if that is what we're going to be stuck with, we might just as well write the assignment provision right out of the Act.</text>
