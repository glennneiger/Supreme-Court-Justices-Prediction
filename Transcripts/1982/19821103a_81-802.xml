            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="142612">We will hear arguments first this morning in City of Lockhart against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.947" offset="174377">Mr. Mizell, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

          <turn speaker="walter_h_mizell" startTime="12.276" stopTime="54.692">
            <label>Mr. Walter H. Mizell</label>
            <text syncTime="12.276" offset="191618">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.492" offset="208545">This case involves the proper application of the Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.613" offset="236966">It arises out of the circumstances which have developed in the City of Lockhart, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.377" offset="260059">Lockhart's a town of about 7,500 people located in central Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.029" offset="278658">For some 50-odd years prior to 1973, it was governed as a general law city in Texas by a commission form of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.367" offset="320036">It had a mayor, it had two commissioners who were elected at large by numbered places, who were elected for two-year terms every even-numbered year.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="54.692" stopTime="56.985">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="54.692" offset="361309">Was it a majority vote or plurality?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="walter_h_mizell" startTime="56.985" stopTime="585.705">
            <label>Mr. Walter H. Mizell</label>
            <text syncTime="56.985" offset="370504">Plurality.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.143" offset="375102">In 1972, the city began to explore the adoption of a home rule charter, and a charter commission was formed to begin inquiry as to whether or not a charter would be desirable for the City of Lockhart.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.276" offset="439676">They determined that it was and began, as charter commissioners elected subsequently, to draft a home rule charter for the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.401" offset="468202">The charter commission was made up of 15 people, nine of whom were Anglos, six of whom were minority citizens; of those six, four were Mexican Americans and two were Negro.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.002" offset="522537">The commission worked for several months in drafting the charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.062" offset="546779">They ultimately adopted unanimously a version of the charter which was submitted to the city commissioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.606" offset="573005">The commissioners took that charter as proposed and without any change submitted it to the voters of Lockhart.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.086" offset="602890">In February of 1973, the charter was approved and went into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.582" offset="624937">The impact that had on the voting system in Lockhart was to enlarge the city's governing body from three to five.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.815" offset="657851">Now there were a mayor and four councilmen, they were called.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.720" offset="669450">The two additional councilmen were elected by plurality in an off-year election.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.390" offset="692124">That is, they were elected in odd-numbered years for places numbered three and four.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.231" offset="707484">Following the 73 adoption of the charter, elections were held in April of 73 for the two new places that were created, and elections were held thereafter until 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.476" offset="756490">In 1975, the Voting Rights Act was made applicable to the state of Texas and picked up retroactively any changes that would have taken place in the voting system after November of 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.531" offset="808734">This retroactively picked up the adoption of the charter and the changes in the voting system thereby.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.513" offset="832663">But for reasons that are not clear in the record, the charter changes were never submitted to the Justice Department as required by the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.415" offset="868189">Elections continued until 1978; were scheduled for 1979 when the Mexican American plaintiffs in this case filed an action for injunctive relief seeking to block elections in Lockhart under the charter until the charter received pre-clearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.909" offset="930152">It's interesting to know that the injunction issued by the judge in Austin, Texas, the local district judge, was written in such a way that it did not allow elections using numbered places, whether they were under the old system or under the new system.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.668" offset="997234">And so there have been no elections in Lockhart until this day because the city was foreclosed... at least it felt that it was... by the wording of the order from going back to the prior system.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.586" offset="1032865">Although it would have been willing to initially.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.478" offset="1040493">The city's position in Austin in the district court there and has been all along was that the changes adopted in 1973 by the charter were probably advantageous for minority voting rights in Lockhart, or at least neutral, but certainly not negative in their impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.140" offset="1119069">In 1982, this year, as set forth in the supplemental brief we filed a week or so ago, Judge Hepalito Garci, the judge in San Antonio who now has charge of the 1979 proceedings, in response to a motion for interim elections which was filed by the intervenor in this case, reviewed the order that had been entered in 1979 and revised that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.757" offset="1217603">And the language that he revised had to do with the procedure by which elections could be conducted pending pre-clearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.831" offset="1245920">The language of his order clarifies and allows the city to return to the prior system of electing a mayor and two commissioners every other year until such time as pre-clearance is either granted, or if it's denied I presume that we would stay with the old system.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.046" offset="1298792">The impact of that order is that it substantially undercuts both the position of the intervenor in this case with regard to what the standard for measurement should be under the Voting Rights Act, and it also undermines the position of the lower court below which framed its opinion in terms of an assumption or conclusion that the judge in Austin, Texas had concluded that the prior system, using numbered places for election of the two places that were existing at that time, that those numbered places were invalid under Texas law.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.700" offset="1457407">So we have the district court in Washington relying in part upon what it believed to be the finding by the district judge in Austin, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.197" offset="1491366">That ruling has now been reversed upon reconsideration by the judge, and we are now free for the first time since this litigation began, free to return to the system which was in effect, in practice, prior to the adoption of the charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.814" offset="1553851">This means that for purposes of comparison, it's the City of Lockhart's position that the appropriate standard was, and at all times has been, the actual system that was in operation in Lockhart and had been since 1917 or thereabouts, using the numbered places.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.622" offset="1621038">Now with that in mind, the question becomes what kind of standard of comparison did the court below used.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.963" offset="1654370">It's our contention that the court below erred as a matter of law in making the comparison to the wrong standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.131" offset="1683105">The allegation was made that numbered places in a general law city, in Lockhart, Texas, were in contravention of state law, and therefore, were deemed by the district court below to be invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.031" offset="1750710">They made the comparison and the expert testimony educed on behalf of the intervenor and on behalf of the Justice Department below were based upon the assumption that the system that had been in operation was illegal under Texas law.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.586" offset="1812881">The city first takes the position that that's not supportable under Texas law, and we argued that vigorously in the district court below, but we haven't briefed that for this Court because we really don't think it makes any difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.767" offset="1865649">The law that this Court has followed at least since Perkins versus Matthews of 1971 is that you don't look at some theoretical system that should be used or might be used or could be used; you focus on the system that was actually in effect, and measure the changes against that system.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.760" offset="1941613">The system actually in effect is undisputed in this case; and that is, numbered places for election of the two city commissioners prior to adoption of the charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.116" offset="1979020">Therefore, in trying to identify the precise nature of the changes which were rightly reviewable by the court below, the city urges that there were really only two changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.110" offset="2030952">The first change was the enlargement of the city's governing body from three to five; that's mayor plus two commissioners to now mayor plus four city councilmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.373" offset="2068045">We take the position and strongly urge it, that putting numbered places for the two new councilmen whose positions were just created there, was not a change because Lockhart had been using numbered places for over half a century.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.209" offset="2143383">So what we really did was we just made the council bigger and continued that system in operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.926" offset="2166266">The court below was divided, and Chief Judge Spottswood Robinson took a slightly different tact in his dissent with regard to those numbered places for the two new seats.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.043" offset="2218720">He took the position that although the two new seats were unobjectionable, that putting numbered places on those did constitute a change.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.634" offset="2261143">And then he went on to make the comparison in the before and after test and determined that it didn't make any difference that there was no negative impact whether you considered the imposition of numbered places to the two new seats.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.344" offset="2335957">He decided that that did not constitute a negative impact change.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.360" offset="2352049">And under Beer versus United States which this Court decided in 1976, without retrogressive effect the addition of the numbered places to the two new seats, he concluded, did not have a negative impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.042" offset="2402726">The city's position, as I say, is slightly different.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.260" offset="2411608">We simply think that enlarging the council's governing body, or the city's governing body, by two places meant that the numbered place system was carried forward, and the only thing to be really measured was whether or not enlarging the size of the city's governing body had positive, negative or neutral impact.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="620.067" offset="2622782">So you concede that it was a change that must satisfy the Beer standard.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="walter_h_mizell" startTime="625.707" stopTime="973.577">
            <label>Mr. Walter H. Mizell</label>
            <text syncTime="625.707" offset="2645352">--We certainly do.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.924" offset="2650263">And the second change, which was brought about by the charter, was the staggered term aspect of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.294" offset="2683699">And again, Chief Judge Robinson below in his dissent recognized that you have to... if you just take a four or five-member governing body that's being elected all at once every other year and carve it up into three one year and two the next, that's one situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.427" offset="2768232">But our position is... and Chief Judge Robinson below noted this... it depends on how they get there as to whether or not there's any discriminatory impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.767" offset="2805639">If you're creating two new ones and happen to decide to elect them in an odd-numbered year or off-year election, then there's no way that you can determine any discriminatory impact because now you have a totally new election for two new seats that never existed before.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.058" offset="2870841">If you move from five elected all at once to two one year and three the next, that could certainly have discriminatory impact, and we don't have any argument with that proposition of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.584" offset="2908875">What we do argue is that under the circumstances by which these two new seats were created, there was no negative impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.597" offset="2936983">And Chief Judge Robinson in the court below agreed with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.143" offset="2955164">So we think that first, the court below used an erroneous standard with respect to the numbered places.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.061" offset="2990795">That is, that they compared it against some fictitious scheme that never had existed before, never will exist so far as Judge Hepalito Garcia's order is concerned because if this Court were to rule against us and we return to the prior system, we do it as a home rule city and now, under the old election system.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.800" offset="3077730">Which brings me to another point.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.128" offset="3087030">The third question that was raised in our brief before this Court dealt with the actual status of the City of Lockhart as a home rule city.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.827" offset="3125900">There is some language in the opinion by the majority below which casts some doubt as to whether or not they intended to reduce Lockhart to its general law status.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.322" offset="3171876">The status that it had under Texas law, prior to adoption of the charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.759" offset="3189639">It's not entirely clear, and I certainly want to be open with the Court on that point, that the decision below is a little bit vague as to what they intended on that, but we wanted to be cautious, so we brought the matter to this Court as the third point in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.440" offset="3252333">In response to that point, the Justice Department has taken the position in its brief that we have over-reacted and that the language there that casts doubt upon the home rule status is simply not worthy of that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.888" offset="3310116">And it is my understanding from reading the intervenor's brief that they also take the position.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.182" offset="3331327">So what you have now, as I understand it, is the Justice Department is not taking the position that we were reduced to general law status; the intervenor is not taking that position and certainly, the city would not want to take that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.676" offset="3373228">So I think the Court could safely conclude then that all the parties before the Court are now taking a position that we are and will continue to be a home rule city, operating as a home rule city with all the powers that are granted to a home rule city under Texas law.</text>

            <text syncTime="835.871" offset="3486076">The facts below, to the extent that they rest upon fact findings, may be seen to be clearly erroneous under Rule 52 and the standard which governs this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.440" offset="3540307">Although it doesn't necessarily have to be that way because if they are using the wrong legal standard, then the facts that they find may have very little applicability to what this Court might want to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.811" offset="3597776">But to the extent that there was testimony below which has bearing upon the changes that were brought about by the City of Lockhart, it's the city's position that the changes that were brought about had a retrogressive impact, first based upon an improper legal standard, but secondly, they're not supportable under the record anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.162" offset="3687219">The finding that adoption of two new seats using numbered places and using an off-year election has retrogressive impact under the Beer decision is just almost indefensible.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.046" offset="3738733">And I know that's very strong language, but it doesn't make logical sense in the sense of what you would intuitively expect if you enlarge a city's governing body and the impact that that would have on the electability of a minority.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.039" offset="3802681">It doesn't make sense with respect to the evidence that was before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.554" offset="3820757">The only evidence before the court which was based upon a proper standard of review... that is, compare the system in effect before and the system in effect after and make your decision based upon that... was the evidence from Dr. Delbert Taebel, an expert in the area, who said, Enlarging a city's governing body, based upon my studies, generally has a positive impact upon the electability of an Hispanic minority.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.949" offset="3938308">And he has tables and their exhibits in the court below are in the record, which demonstrate that that is so.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.882" offset="3966103">Now, he didn't do an incremental study going from two to three or three to four or six to seven; he grouped them in sizes, small councils, medium councils and large councils and he abstracted his conclusion from that.</text>

            <text syncTime="979.969" offset="4062442">His conclusion was that enlarging the charter didn't have just a neutral... excuse me, enlarging the city's governing body was not just neutral in impact; that enlarging it has a positive impact on the minority chances for election.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.693" offset="4133286">And even though you do it in the context of numbered places, as the new places, or in the context of a staggered term, that, he says, does not erase the positive impact that that has on the electability of a minority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.279" offset="4187725">The government's expert witness never made the comparison in a proper way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.420" offset="4204235">And to the extent that the third expert witness testified... that would be Dr. Cervantes who was the intervenor's witness... in response to questions by Judge Pratt below stated that well, at best, it was neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.552" offset="4260764">It was like reading the same issue or getting two issues of the same newspaper, he said.</text>

            <text syncTime="1035.238" offset="4283543">So if you're comparing it under the proper standard, as we have presented it here, there is no evidence from the expert testimony of any adverse impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.033" offset="4322726">The final thing, and the government points this up in its brief quite clearly, you don't have to worry about political theory or anything like that in determining the impact of the charter system in Lockhart.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.260" offset="4375598">All you have to do is look at the record of minority participation in this town and you'll see that since 1970 voter registration... 70 is the only... we don't have a figure for 1973 or we'd tie it down a little closer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.722" offset="4437456">We have figures from 1970 through 77, I believe it is that show that voter registration has increased tremendously in the minority population in Lockhart.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.765" offset="4473610">Voter participation has increased tremendously.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.170" offset="4487193">The number of minority candidates has increased tremendously since the charter was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.497" offset="4508509">And finally, in 1978, we actually had a member of the Mexican American community elected to office on the city council and he remains in office today since we haven't had any other elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.149" offset="4551141">So you have logic which demands, I would submit, demands a finding that adoption of the charter had positive impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.052" offset="4586772">You have the expert testimony which says it's positive or at worst, neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.423" offset="4604222">And then you have the actual experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.954" offset="4614357">So it's the city's position that the court below just got off on the wrong track and ended up using the wrong standard of comparison.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jose Garza</label>
            <text syncTime="1619.650" offset="6621188">Mr. Chief Justice, and if it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.586" offset="6632891">I'd like to address a few of the things that counsel for the appellants has raised in regard to the litigation in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.804" offset="6661730">It is our position, in terms of the orders that were issued in Texas, that the court there never prohibited the city from reverting to the prior existing election system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.096" offset="6706974">It parrotted the letter of objection from the Department of Justice and it prohibited elections pursuant to an election system within the charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.419" offset="6748248">Additionally, the district court below never ruled on the illegality or the legality of using numbered posts in the prior existing election system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.395" offset="6804150">And in fact, the district court in this case below did not base its finding of the legality or its finding on that issue on any ruling out of the Texas court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.282" offset="6847722">That's simply not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.203" offset="6859321">Additionally, some of the facts that I think this Court ought to consider that were established in the court below in determining the backdrop upon which the lower court reviewed the election change are several points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.948" offset="6926403">First of all, the record below shows that the community in Lockhart is a divided community; substantial segregated housing patterns exist and were brought up during the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.379" offset="6968094">There is a high degree of racially polarized voting in the election system in Lockhart.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.909" offset="6990246">And race becomes an issue in election systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.858" offset="7006024">And I agree with counsel for the appellants that one need not theorize about the impact of this election structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.949" offset="7030370">There are six elections that were conducted using the post-charter election system upon which one can measure the impact of that election structure on the Mexican American community and the minority community in Lockhart.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.413" offset="7088258">In those six elections, seven Mexican Americans have run for office; only one has won.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.286" offset="7111663">An election rate of approximately 14 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.941" offset="7122321">On the other hand, there have been 35 Anglo candidates, and 15 have been successful for an election rate of 43 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.048" offset="7154713">What's significant in this situation is that you would expect a drop-off in success rate for Anglos because they opposed each other in some elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.106" offset="7190971">There were no Mexican Americans that opposed each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.074" offset="7202883">Significant also in that situation is that Anglo candidates, in fact, ran unopposed during that tenure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.054" offset="7230782">No Mexican American ran unopposed during that tenure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.619" offset="7244992">Another point I think that's important in determining what are the issues before this Court, I think it is an issue whether there was an election change.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.769" offset="7285639">The appellant suggests that the only election change was the enhancement of the council; the increase in council size.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.220" offset="7315419">Our position is that the election change that subjects the review of the election plan for Lockhart is a change in government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.685" offset="7345303">The record below is significant on this point in terms of the difference between the two structures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.212" offset="7371425">The general law city and the home rule city.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.351" offset="7383964">There's a significant difference.</text>

            <text syncTime="2521.049" offset="10226713">In addition, the Perkins court specifically said that they were not going to allow political jurisdiction subject to Section 5 to profit by its prior illegal activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.323" offset="10279899">A ruling based on Perkin in this situation that we cannot challenge the legality or cannot base the election change from illegal to legal in this situation would have just the opposite impact, that the Perkins court sought to avoid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.143" offset="10351161">An additional point I think that needs to be made in terms of the retrogressive impact of the election change in Lockhart is the use of staggered terms for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.243" offset="10435484">The testimony and the record reveals that staggered terms result in lowering the voter turnout generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.556" offset="10472787">And testimony also reveals that when there is lower voter turnout, it impacts disproportionately upon the minority community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.284" offset="10503716">That, in fact, is the record in Lockhart.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.722" offset="10513433">In the election where turnout was the lowest, it was significantly lower among the Mexican American population.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.267" offset="10543631">And that was an additional reason for the ruling of the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.966" offset="10570380">Finally, I think the final point in this situation is that Section 2, even if there is no retrogression, Section 2 would preclude a pre-clearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.885" offset="10614057">The Senate Report in the footnote that was referred to earlier I think is quite clear that if there is on retrogression, the election system can still be measured under the results test that was developed for the amendment of Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.580" offset="10676855">The Beer case talks about the going beyond retrogression standard and insuring that an election system is not unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.121" offset="10727010">At that time, Section 2 incorporated the constitutional standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.543" offset="10744774">Now it incorporates the results test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.727" offset="10753446">And I think it would be... the debate on the House floor referred to the impact of the amendment on Section 2 and the footnote.</text>
