            <text syncTime="5.967" offset="116106">The first is Texas against Brown, a case which began in a Texas state court when a police officer stopped a passing car and asked the driver for his driver's license.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.050" offset="160409">While the driver Brown was looking for the license, the police officer involves saw him drop a small green party balloon, knotted near the tip under the front seat.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.615" offset="198653">The officer could also see the car's glove compartment containing assortment of vials, and loose white powder.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.911" offset="223835">The officer concluded that Brown was probably carrying drugs and seized the balloon.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.728" offset="243165">The chemical test of the balloon later showed that it contained heroin and Brown was charged with state law drug violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.026" offset="272318">The Texas courts however, held the balloon had been seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment to United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.074" offset="300530">And that it could not be used as evidence against Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.293" offset="321428">Today we reverse that decision with all nine members of the Court deciding that the plain-view doctrine permitted seizure of the balloon in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.380" offset="361761">The line up is as follows:I have filed an opinion joined by the Chief Justice, Justice White, and Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.137" offset="392795">Justice White has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.930" offset="403975">Justice Powell joined by Justice Blackmun has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.948" offset="424037">Justice Stevens joined by Justices Brennan and Marshall has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
