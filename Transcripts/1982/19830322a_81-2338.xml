            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="143437">We will hear arguments first this morning in Regan against Taxation with Representation of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.746" offset="182412">Mr. Solicitor General, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="12.869" stopTime="177.158">
            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="12.869" offset="194846">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.944" offset="211146">Congress has provided two general types of tax relief, either or both of which may be available to certain kinds of organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.785" offset="250539">First, Section 501(c) exempts the income of about two dozen different types of organizations from taxation on that income.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.421" offset="289096">Second, Section 170 entitles the donors to a smaller number of 501(c) organizations including both veterans groups and also groups qualifying under 501(c)(3) to deduct their contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.008" offset="351372">One of the qualifications for 501(c)(3) status, and, therefore, both tax exemption and also donor contribution deductibility, is that no substantial part of the entity's activity consists of attempts to influence legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.549" offset="409573">The proposed activities of the Appellee which has unsuccessfully sought recognition as a 501(c)(3) organization will consist principally of attempts to influence legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.369" offset="464848">It attacks the constitutionality of the scheme that I just described on two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.039" offset="495568">The first is that withholding tax exempt status from 501(c)(3) or any other organizations which lobby is a violation of a first amendment right.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.769" offset="534438">The second is that since Congress has afforded tax exempt status to veterans organizations which lobby but not to 501(c)(3) organizations which lobby, its equal protection rights have been denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.388" offset="592952">The En Banc Court of Appeals unanimously held, and we agree, that the Appellees' first amendment argument is foreclosed by this Court's unanimous holding in Cammarano versus The United States that the constitution does not require Congress to subsidize First Amendment activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.021" offset="663483">With respect to equal protection, the Court of Appeals further observed, and I am quoting, that</text>
            <text syncTime="136.253" offset="688351">"Taxation also has a weak case solely in terms of equal protection because of Congress's vast leeway under the constitution to classify the recipients of its benefits and to favor some groups over others. "</text>
            <text syncTime="150.607" offset="745821">Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals ruled that a heightened standard of equal protection scrutiny was applicable and that it was infringed in this case because First Amendment rights were affected even though they had not been infringed.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.022" offset="815515">The Court remanded to the District Court with instruction to cure the unequal treatment which it found by one of two alternatives.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="177.158" stopTime="184.670">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="177.158" offset="851982">Well, did the Court of Appeals use that rather obscure phrase that you just used that First Amendment rights were affected but not infringed?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="184.670" stopTime="340.498">
            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="184.670" offset="882075">Well, it first held, Justice Rehnquist, that under Cammarano they had not been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.920" offset="907048">I think that is more my characterization, but I think that is the only fair way that the Court of Appeals' opinion can be read because of the effect upon First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.306" offset="944560">The Court identified as the most logical remedy option to impose the lobbying restriction on veterans organizations none of which is a party to this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.581" offset="993670">It also identified another alternative: judicially enlarging the Congressional list of exempt organizations to include the 501(c)(3)'s which the Court observed, correctly in our view, might open a Pandora's box of woes and abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.015" offset="1059395">In our view, the underpinning of the Court of Appeals' holding has to be that Congress has violated the equal protection clause even though there is no direct infringement of a First Amendment right if Government treats different groups of people in different ways and the deferential treatment comes to rest on a First Amendment or other fundamental right interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.593" offset="1165765">That is the combination of circumstances that brings the equal protection guarantee into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.671" offset="1194082">Whatever appeal that argument might have had, if we were at the dawning of its day in Court, I submit that it comes too late because it has already been considered and rejected by this Court which has held on at least three separate occasions that Government subsidization of one group but not another even where the fundamental rights of the nonsubsidized group will be affected violates no constitutional guarantee.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.251" offset="1324381">Buckley versus Valeo, for example, upheld provisions of the Internal Revenue Code which granted public funds to the candidates of major parties but not minor parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.806" offset="1378611">There was clearly unequal treatment, and there was an arguable impact on First Amendment values.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.492" offset="1401390">Similarly, in Monner versus Roe and Harris versus McRae congressional statutes providing medicaid funds for indigent live births but prohibiting such funds for abortions were attacked on the same grounds advanced here, namely, that the impact of the different treatment came to rest on a fundamental constitutional right of the disfavored group, namely, the right to decide whether or not to have an abortion.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="340.498" stopTime="346.354">
            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="340.498" offset="1505357">But the Court in those cases left open a situation which I take it you are going to come to.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="346.354" stopTime="744.762">
            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="346.354" offset="1528763">Yes, but the difference of treatment in those cases was undeniable, and the effect was on a fundamental constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.445" offset="1573171">Nevertheless, the Court held that there was a legal protection violation because there is a basic difference between direct state interference with a protective activity and state encouragement of an alternative activity consonant with legislative policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.440" offset="1629177">Now the difference between those cases and the instant case: in our view there are two that are relevant, and both of them make this case a stronger case for constitutionality than in Harris and in Monner.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.480" offset="1681318">The first difference is that in those cases the two things that were treated differently were mutually preclusive competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.790" offset="1714546">That is to say, the statutorily preferred event which was birth necessarily precluded the constitutionally protected abortion decision by the indigent person so that to whatever extent funding encourages child birth, abortion is necessarily inhibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.751" offset="1794376">Here by contrast, subsidizing veterans groups has no automatic detrimental effect on charitable groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.292" offset="1828544">The second difference, and in my view the more important one, is that the classification in this case is part of our national acts of laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.461" offset="1869190">This Court has made it very clear that for equal protection purposes, income tax cases are in a class by themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.129" offset="1903881">The Internal Revenue Code is perhaps without peer in its intricacy, its detail, and its sheer length.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.344" offset="1932720">By their very nature, most income tax provisions classify.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.530" offset="1953514">Their function is to identify under what circumstances the burden of different groups in our society, the share of the National tax burden borne by different groups is to be either increased or decreased.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.413" offset="2017044">In carrying out this function, Congress necessarily treats different people in different ways, and many of those differences have an arguable impact on a fundamental right.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.317" offset="2056645">Importing heightened scrutiny as the test governing the constitutionality of that kind of a complex and inner-related statutory construct would seriously damage the certainty and the predictability that should be characteristic of our national tax laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.278" offset="2128534">Aside from everything else that ought to go into a fair tax system, it is important that taxpayers know with as much certainty as possible what their obligations are.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.507" offset="2169390">That certainty value is enhanced by the rational basis equal protection has because of the likelihood that it ensures that the congressional judgment will in fact survive.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.051" offset="2219545">It is diminished, correspondingly, by a test of heightened scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.143" offset="2243995">Look at the matter from Congress's standpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.420" offset="2253086">It is probable that the time will never come when Congress does not have before it some proposal for change in the income tax law.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.060" offset="2291643">Congress's ability to respond to new developments, new information, new understanding is a difficult enough task under any circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.601" offset="2333752">It should not be rendered even more burdensome by increasing the likelihood that the judgments that Congress makes will be turned around by the Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.235" offset="2372309">Take this case, for example: Section 501(c) consists of 22 categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.562" offset="2393625">It comes of no surprise to anyone that the Court of Appeals found that two of those categories resulted in a difference in treatment to their occupants.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.435" offset="2445138">Of course, there are differences in treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.588" offset="2453706">If Congress had not intended differences in treatment, there would not be 22 categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.912" offset="2478993">The point is that the entire Code, and not just these 22 categories, essentially consists of differences in treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.113" offset="2511803">That, I submit, is why this Court has consistently accorded great deference to Congressional line drawing in the income tax area.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.984" offset="2547329">It is repeatedly stated, and most recently in San Antonio versus Rodriguez, that in taxation, even more than in other fields, legislatures possess the greatest freedom in classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.352" offset="2600828">That brings me to the final point.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.977" offset="2611277">That is whether the distinction between lobbying by veterans groups on the one hand and lobbying by 501(c)(3) organizations on the other satisfies this deferential standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.908" offset="2666970">Quite clearly, it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.624" offset="2673866">Prior to 1934 there were no express statutory limitations on lobbying by exempt organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.576" offset="2713677">Congress was concerned, however, in 1934 that the deductibility of contributions to organizations otherwise classified as religious, charitable, or education could effectively translate into the public financing of private propagandizing on a range of subjects limited only by the donor's whim and the attractiveness of that abuse increased with the donor's wealth.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.000" offset="2827362">It was a concern that was first expressed by Judge Hand for a unanimous Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in 1930 in a case called Slee versus The Commissioner, and as this Court observed in Cammarano, the 1934 act made explicit the conclusion derived by Judge Hand in 1930 in Slee.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.416" offset="2893086">Very simply, there are differences between veterans organizations on the one hand and 501(c)(3) organizations on the other that are highly pertinent to this concern first expressed by Judge Hand in 1930 and then ratified by Congress in 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.563" offset="2961631">In the first place, there are quantitative differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.655" offset="2973961">The number of veterans organizations is only a fraction of the total number of the 501(c)(3) groups, and the 501(c)(3)'s collect about 1500 times as much in contributions as do the veterans groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.054" offset="3035610">Even more important, these organizations structurally by virtue of the way they are chartered by Congress and in fact carry out their operations do not offer the opportunities for abuse identified by Judge Hand in 1930 and by Congress in 1934.</text>

            <text syncTime="784.873" offset="3282833">The most recent that I am aware of is Johnson versus Robison in which this Court upheld the deferential treatment insofar as veterans' benefits were concerned to conscientious objectors and to those... the benefits went to those who had seen actual combat duty, and the challenge was by a conscientious objector.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.630" offset="3365902">The point is, as set forth in our brief, the figures that have been released by the Government demonstrate that two out of five of every American citizen is a beneficiary in one way or another of veterans' legislation which has been passed by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.901" offset="3434970">Just as is the case with the income tax laws, this Court has also clarified that there is a great deal of deference to which Congress is entitled in determining the benefits to which those persons are entitled who have made a great sacrifice for the benefit of this country, both in terms of interrupting their civilian pursuits and also in terms of risking their life and their health.</text>

            <text syncTime="1186.769" offset="4890513">The crucial language is that the Court on one of these 7428 reviews may make a declaration with respect to such initial qualification or continuing qualification.</text>

            <text syncTime="1219.302" offset="5020603">In this case, the congressional purpose was rather clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.179" offset="5036067">It was to undo the inequity that resulted as a result of the decisions in Bob Jones versus Simon, the 1974 decision, the companion case that came down the same day in Americans United.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.093" offset="5087790">The only way one of these 501(c)(3) or other types of organizations could obtain a determination as to whether they did or did not qualify was to either have a refund suit in the District or to go into the Tax Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.494" offset="5137318">Now, since the objective law is to provide one simply remedy for determination of 501(c)(3) status vel non, it would be a bit anomalous to say that Congress intended to split those out and require constitutional determination through the old and more difficult process.</text>

            <label>Mr. John Cary Sims</label>
            <text syncTime="1521.510" offset="6229445">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.461" offset="6253269">In this case, Appellee challenges the severe penalty which is imposed on public charities if they choose to engage in substantial lobbying as a means of promoting their charitable purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.501" offset="6305409">Let me emphasize at this point that the case only involves public charities, that is, organizations under Section 501(c)(3) which are not private foundations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.664" offset="6362043">Private foundations are groups that, as defined in the Tax Reform Act of 1969 and the IRS Regulations implementing that statute, are groups where there is not seen to be enough accountability to the public to assure that the organization will act in the same way that it would if it were accountable to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.172" offset="6460054">The Tax Reform Act of 1969 virtually precludes lobbying by private foundations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.528" offset="6489520">We think that is important because when the Solicitor General was referring to what he believes Congress was concerned about in putting into effect the restriction that we are challenging here, he is talking about the possibility that a charity might really not be acting for charitable purposes in particular circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.580" offset="6573739">It may be that a particular individual would be attempting to manipulate a charity or perhaps even set up a charity in order to serve private concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.734" offset="6606340">Well, under the Tax Reform Act of 1969 Congress has already defined the group of organizations where there could be a legitimate concern that there is not enough public accountability, and Congress has acted independently, and that issue is not before the Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.431" offset="6677079">Another point that I think is worth making with regard to the risk that a public charity might lobby in order to promote some private interest, we would like to point out that first of all to the extent that there is any risk in that regard, lobbying isn't any different than any other activities that a charity might engage in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.967" offset="6763284">That is, I suppose one could say that there is some risk that a charity might engage in litigation or pamphleting or publishing of educational books in order to promote some private interest, so the argument made by the Solicitor General doesn't really hone in specifically on the lobbying issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.836" offset="6834755">As we have emphasized in our brief, there are also a number of independent restrictions that aren't challenged in this case that would prevent a public charity from using its resources for lobbying or for any other activity on behalf of private interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.300" offset="6896613">Under the IRS regulations in order to qualify in the first place for 501(c)(3) exemptions, you have to be operating for the public good rather than for a private good.</text>

            <text syncTime="1698.622" offset="6937886">Are you suggesting, Mr. Sims, that IRS could make an evaluation in each case of each exempt taxpayer and say,</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.136" offset="6979891">"You are 33 and a third percent over the line here, so we will cut off 33 and a third percent of your exemption? "</text>

            <text syncTime="1720.534" offset="7025553">Your Honor, if Congress were to pass that alternative statute, that would deal with our argument about the disproportionate penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.516" offset="7065468">To the extent that there was a penalty on lobbying that was tied in amount to the amount of excessing lobbying beyond whatever Congress said was appropriate, the disproportionate aspect of the current penalty would be eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.509" offset="7129416">We don't believe that would make the statute constitutional because you are still left with the core question that comes up in any First Amendment case which is first of all what is the congressional interest that is being promoted by the restriction, and secondly, has Congress in developing the particulars of the restriction done it in as narrow and as minimally restrictive a way as possible.</text>

            <text syncTime="1795.335" offset="7324707">In addition, the statute itself says that any charity has to be organized and operated exclusively for exempt purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2111.237" offset="8588302">We would like to clarify that in two respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.704" offset="8602199">First of all, all of the activities engaged in by Taxation must be directed to charitable ends.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.546" offset="8633546">We think that the distinction between lobbying as a mean and lobbying as some ultimate end is one that is reflected at a number of places in the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.727" offset="8682343">We never have argued that lobbying, per se, is a charitable purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.020" offset="8699479">We emphasize that under the law of trust and under the common law and under the IRS regulations, lobbying is a proper means of promoting a charitable purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.550" offset="8749635">The reason that Taxation couldn't qualify for Section 501(c)(3) tax exemption in this case is because it couldn't say ahead of time that it would not engage in substantial lobbying.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.199" offset="8804178">We have not indicated that lobbying is going to be the only activity carried on by the organization, and, in fact, the exemption application which is in the record in the case indicates that there are a number of other litigational and educational activities that will be carried on by the organization, but lobbying engaged in by Taxation will be exclusively a means of promoting a charitable end.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.317" offset="8892681">To the extent that the Solicitor General relies on Slee for the proposition that lobbying is not a proper purpose for promoting a charitable end and that somehow the use of that means rather than some other means of promoting a charitable purpose renders the purpose uncharitable, we suggest that even if Slee were properly decided in 1930, and that may be a close question, certainly the law since then has developed very strongly in the direction that lobbying is a proper means of promoting a charitable purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.394" offset="9044923">The restatement of trust says it.</text>
