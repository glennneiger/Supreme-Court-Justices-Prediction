            <text syncTime="14.090" offset="196517">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, for the third time this term I am here to discuss burdens of persuasion and burdens of production, this time in the context of the National Labor Relations Board's allocation of burdens of proof in a proceeding under Section 8(a)(3) of the Act charging a discharge of an employee for anti-union animus.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.482" offset="318039">If the Court please, I would like to proceed with my argument first by describing briefly but comprehensively the overall allocation of burdens of proof in such a proceeding which we believe to be correct and which we believe to be a fair distillation of the Board's decisions and practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.878" offset="415632">I do this because we believe that much of the confusion in this area stems from incomplete analysis and from an effort to force all categories of cases into an analytical framework that suits only some categories of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.479" offset="498075">And after that, I would like to focus on the aspect of the allocation that is at issue here, and show that as to this, the Board faithfully follows the Congressional intent, and that its practice is consistent with principles reflected in this Court's decisions, and then show that these principles were properly applied to the facts of this case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="135.478" offset="682081">To begin with in such a proceeding the general counsel, of course, has a burden of production and a burden of persuasion to show that... we'll talk about discharges here, although this applies to any 8(a)(3) case and to many 8(a)(1) cases involving other adverse action, but to show that the discharge was improperly motivated, that anti-union animus generally was a motivating factor in the meaning of this Court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.883" offset="839652">If he establishes that with his evidence, and that evidence is uncontroverted, of course, he has established his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.677" offset="870894">So in that sense, if he... if his evidence establishes that, there is a burden of production on the employer to controvert it in some way, and the usual manner of controverting it is to show that there was a legitimate reason or reasons for the discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.712" offset="979041">There may be other evidence introduced as well by the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.945" offset="991893">That evidence usually serves two purposes, the evidence of a legitimate reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.193" offset="1024912">One, to rebut the evidence that there was an improper motivation, or two, to show that the discharge would have occurred in any event even in the absence of the improper motivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.513" offset="1094189">Occasionally, that evidence is introduced for only the latter purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.511" offset="1118221">There are cases, and we have cited some, in which the employer admits that an improper purpose was a motivating factor, but nonetheless defends on the ground that the same result would have been reached in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.958" offset="1179975">Now, if what the employer introduces is inherently incredible, or insubstantial on its face, that doesn't really change the case, and in that sense his burden of production has not been satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.434" offset="1253849">But if he has introduced something plausible, as was the case here, he has satisfied that burden of production, and then the burden of persuasion remains on the general counsel to do at least one of two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.193" offset="1328873">One, he might try to persuade the tribunal that the proffered legitimate reasons, and I use "legitimate" only in the sense of non-prohibited, not a value judgment, that the proffered legitimate reasons were not in fact a motivating factor at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.559" offset="1414346">If he carries that burden of persuasion, that is a true pretext case, and he has shown that only the improper motivation was present, and the case remains what it was before that evidence was introduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.239" offset="1493131">But if he is unable to do that, then the question is whether in light of the evidence introduced by the employer, the general counsel can still satisfy the burden of persuasion which is on him by a preponderance of the evidence that the improper reason was also a motivating factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.446" offset="1601905">If in light of all the evidence, including the evidence introduced by the employer, the general counsel still succeeds by a preponderance of the evidence in showing that anti-union animus was a motivating factor, then--</text>

            <text syncTime="382.127" offset="1668674">Mr. Wallace, does the Board actually conduct the presentation of testimony in this kind of segmented way?</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="397.230" offset="1729069">Why does it help the Board, if I might ask, to have these various presumptions and burdens of persuasion?</text>
            <text syncTime="403.931" offset="1755818">Wouldn't it be just as easy for them to hear from one side and then hear from the other and then decide the factual question?</text>
            <text syncTime="409.382" offset="1777657">Well, that is what they... what they really do, but I am trying to specify the analysis used in allocating who had the burden of persuasion on what in issuing their decisions, in analyzing the evidence that has been introduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.765" offset="1851217">Well, I can see how that would be useful if the Board directed a verdict against someone saying that, you know, we are going to stop the proceeding right here because even believing your evidence, it's not enough to even warrant a fact finding, but in proceedings that have gone to completion, and the Board has heard all the evidence, how does this rather structured and somewhat artificial form of analysis move the ball?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="450.615" stopTime="981.196">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="450.615" offset="1942646">Well, it's arguable that the ball would move with greater ease without it, but this is what the Board has been doing to explain its decisions, and it is the context against which Congress legislated in Taft-Hartley in revising the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.074" offset="2024461">I don't think what they did on this subject in Taft-Hartley can be understood without recognition that it was done against this background, and it is the background against which the Courts of Appeals have divided in their views.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.224" offset="2089036">I think to understand what has occurred in this field, we have to recognize how the Board has been analyzing these cases, even if it might have been possible to proceed differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.454" offset="2137937">And I am almost at the end of this overview.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.203" offset="2156955">I was saying, if the general counsel was unable to show that it was a pretext, the clearest way of doing that would be to show that the reason didn't exist at all factually, or as was the case with one of the reasons here, that the employer didn't know about it until after the discharge decision was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.959" offset="2251936">Or there can be other ways of showing it was a pretext, such as by showing that this was commonly done with impunity by other employees to the knowledge of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.985" offset="2292060">In any event, if he doesn't succeed in showing that it was a pretext, but nonetheless carries his burden of persuasion, showing by a preponderance of the evidence that anti-union animus was also a motivating factor, then we have a true dual motive case, and we have a case in which the general counsel has satisfied his burden of persuasion that a violation of Section 8(a)(3) occurred by showing that the adverse action, the discharge took place for a prohibited reason, because from the beginning, if the discharge took place in whole or in part for a prohibitive... for a prohibited reason, that was sufficient to show a violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.571" offset="2514414">Part of the confusion stems, however, from the fact that the Board still refers to this showing as a prima facie case, and the reason it does that is because it recognizes the possibility of the employer still establishing an affirmative defense, by showing with respect to a hypothetical question that the discharge would have occurred for the legitimate reasons even in the absence of the improper motivation for the discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.368" offset="2669581">And on that question, the Board has consistently placed the burden of persuasion as well as of production on the employer, and the Board has referred to this as an affirmative defense, and the issue in this case, the difference between the Board and the court of appeals in this case focuses solely on this phase of the analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.748" offset="2783162">Now, whether it is proper for the Board to place the burden of persuasion on this question on the employer, or whether the burden of persuasion must remain with the general counsel on this question, and this is a matter that was addressed with great specificity in the legislative history of Taft-Hartley, and unlike some cases in which the Board appears before the Court, where we are contending that the Board's interpretation of the Act on a specific matter is a reasonable interpretation among reasonable alternatives, and therefore should be sustained, this, it seems to us, is an interpretation required by the legislative history of the revision of the Act in Taft-Hartley.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.443" offset="3021921">And I would like to turn to the pertinent materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.363" offset="3045640">It was well established, as we have shown in cases collected starting at Page 15 of our brief, prior to Taft-Hartley, that if the discharge was motivated in whole or in part by the improper motivation, a violation had been shown, and that the burden was on the employer to prove as a defense that he would have reached the same result in the absence of the improper motivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.703" offset="3222959">Many Board opinions, and we have quoted one on Page 16, referred to language used in a well known Second Circuit opinion, NLRB against Remington Rand, which is cited at the bottom of Page 16 of our brief, in which Learned Hand rejected the defense factually, although he said it was a proper defense for the employer to make, in language that was quoted and requoted many times, that it rested upon the tort feasor, as he called the employer, because the general counsel had shown that he had acted out of improper motivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.045" offset="3392337">It rested upon the tort feasor to disentangle the consequences for which it was chargeable from those for which it was immune.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.136" offset="3424729">And that interpretation was made clear in annual reports to Congress which we have cited in Footnote 9 on Page 18, and was criticized in the House hearings quite specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.379" offset="3497663">We have referred to that also in Footnote 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.174" offset="3512814">And a change in the law was advocated, and indeed the House bill would have changed the law specifically in that respect, and on Page 18 of our brief we have described the provision that was in the House bill to change the law on that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.495" offset="3594107">That provision was not in the Senate bill, and the conference committee struck it in favor of retaining the existing practice before the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.301" offset="3645307">This was one of many examples, as we have reminded the Court from time to time, in which the strategy of the conference was against making particular changes because they had in mind larger objectives to be achieved in Taft-Hartley.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.917" offset="3731825">It was the first time that the Act was going to specify categories of unfair labor practices by unions, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.117" offset="3768605">They wanted to overrule this Court's Packard decision, which had included foremen within bargaining units, and they knew they had to anticipate a veto from President Truman, so they had to keep together a broad-based coalition that would be able to override the veto, and other matters were not being changed because of their desire to accomplish these major objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.199" offset="3876961">And Senator Taft, in an extended interchange on the floor in reporting the conference bill, and we have quoted pertinent portions of it on Page 20 of our brief, an extended interchange with Senator Pepper, who was raising this problem that the House had tried to shift the burden of proof away from the employer on this issue, kept pointing out repeatedly that this was struck by the conference committee from the House bill, and as we say at the conclusion of the excerpt we have here, under provision of the conference report, the employer has to make the proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.105" offset="4044563">This is the present rule and the present practice of the Board.</text>

            <text syncTime="1032.832" offset="4271515">Well, it wasn't always articulated well by the Board, and the reason for this is that until Wright-Line, in the cases in which the Board was ruling for the general counsel and holding that the employer did not sustain its burden of proving that the discharge or other adverse action would have occurred anyway, the Board tended to articulate the dual motive aspect of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.271" offset="4409232">But when the Board was ruling for the employer in these cases, it tended not to articulate that it was a dual motive case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1974.169" offset="8036804">The amendment of '47 corrected that course, so that the Board cannot use the in part motive, such that the Board must be of an opinion completely based upon a preponderance of the evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2725.184" offset="11040886">The Board says, and specifically on Page 10 of its brief on the merits, that its test is fully consistent with Burdine, fully consistent, having recognized that the prima facie case is an inference, and that compels an employer now to have an affirmative defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.880" offset="11111626">And yet when you look at the history of the Board's Wright-Line, it bases its understanding of an employment discrimination test on Mt.</text>

            <text syncTime="2753.814" offset="11155407">You cannot have an employer with an affirmative defense and also suggest that your employment discrimination test is also consistent with this conceptual approach of a three-part system where the plaintiff employee ultimately must bear the burden persuasively to show that but for the employer's impermissible discriminatory motive, he will not have acted as he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.833" offset="11275466">That is the mandate of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.581" offset="11286437">The Act in 10(c) and generally intends to make it relatively easy and best serves the parties in this regard if it is easy for them to raise a prima facie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.546" offset="11338368">That accomplishes two things principally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.559" offset="11346414">On the one hand, it does not create a heavy burden for the employee in his quest for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.104" offset="11368566">He can come forward, show that he was involved in some protected union activity, and he has created a motivation for the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.241" offset="11405137">The inference is there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.553" offset="11410362">The employer, on the other hand, cannot sid idly by.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.958" offset="11428021">He must be an active participant in this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.161" offset="11436798">He must come forward and proffer a reason or reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.706" offset="11451008">If he does, then he is assisted in posturing a Section 8 case in a very correct way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.780" offset="11479221">He joins the factual dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.577" offset="11486430">10(c) now mandates that the Board, by compelling the general counsel to do its work, and the Board has indicated that, in fact, in its own rules, the general counsel should have the burden of proof in all Section 8 cases, to come forward with evidence to show that the Board can find on a preponderance of the evidence that the employer either acted permissibly or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.052" offset="11584337">In other words, the Board must find the causal relationship between the employee's conduct and the employer's conduct, such that it can be said justifiably that but for that employee's engagement in protected activity, he would not have suffered adversely as a result of the employee's conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.995" offset="11676079">That is the mandate of the Act, to balance competing interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.681" offset="11698858">I might point out that the balancing of these interests occurred long before Wright-Line came out of the Board in 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.753" offset="11751208">I think it came out of to some extent what this Court tried to say in Great Dane in '67, which was shortly after the adoption of the amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.405" offset="11785794">There, the Court, in speaking to the issue that a violation of 8(a)(3) normally turns on a discriminatory conduct motivated by anti-union activity or attitude specifically addressed the issue of burden of proof, not the issue of burden of persuasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.741" offset="11871057">And if you would just allow me for a moment, I would like to quote what we consider the critical language in that teaching out of Great Dane.</text>

            <text syncTime="3012.209" offset="12189020">There were two days of hearings conducted in which the general counsel called numerous witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.144" offset="12212739">The employer's evidence was mostly by cross examination of those witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.657" offset="12230816">And it was something of a smoking gun case, in which the area manager was quoted as saying that the discharged employee was</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.185" offset="12276896">"two-faced for joining the union, and I'll get even with him. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.792" offset="12291315">And I think in response to the question Justice Stevens asked me at the end, that the findings of the Administrative Law Judge would certainly be more than adequate to dispose of this case properly, and we quote in our reply brief on Page 6, in the first footnote paragraph on that page, we quote those pertinent... the crucial findings, that a preponderance of the evidence establishes that the decision to discharge him was motivated by a desire to discourage union activities, and respondent would not have fired him but for his union activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.133" offset="12472710">Now, the Board adopted those findings, but said, as clarified herein, and what the Board apparently was concerned about was that the Administrative Law Judge wrote shortly before the Board's Wright-Line decision, and the Board was attempting to clarify it by putting it in terms of the Wright-Line decision, and they may well have been worried that the Administrative Law Judge's formulation of the but for his union activities might have meant that the general counsel had had the burden of persuasion on that issue.</text>
