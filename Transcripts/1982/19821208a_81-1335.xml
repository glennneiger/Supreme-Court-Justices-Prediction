            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="154705">We will hear arguments next in District of Columbia Court of Appeals and others against Feldman and Hickey.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.121" offset="195143">Mr. Rezneck, I think you may proceed when you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daniel_a_rezneck" startTime="74.298" stopTime="127.044">
            <label>Mr. Daniel A. Rezneck</label>
            <text syncTime="74.298" offset="451874">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, these two cases are here on a single issue, whether the federal courts in the District of Columbia have jurisdiction to review prior decisions of the D.C. Court of Appeals denying applications to the D.C. bar or the D.C. bar examination by particular applicants.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.806" offset="537869">Rather than burdening the Court with a recital of the facts of these cases, which are fully set out in the brief, I thought it would be useful if I outlined at the outset the routes by which an applicant may obtain admission to the D.C. bar as they bear on these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.690" offset="597428">There are three possible routes.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.300" offset="607877">One is graduation from an ABA;approved law school and success on the D.C. bar examination, and there is no dispute here that neither of these applicants met that standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.544" offset="656778">That particular--</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="127.044" offset="662839">Neither of them?</text>
            <text syncTime="130.590" offset="677049">Did they ever get to the second one?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daniel_a_rezneck" startTime="132.418" stopTime="139.056">
            <label>Mr. Daniel A. Rezneck</label>
            <text syncTime="132.418" offset="684364">--Neither took the bar examination, and neither was a graduate of an ABA approved law school.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="139.056" stopTime="146.647">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="139.056" offset="710904">So they were, as I understood, the problem is that they were barred from taking the examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.678" offset="737340">That is the issue, isn't it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daniel_a_rezneck" startTime="146.647" stopTime="385.674">
            <label>Mr. Daniel A. Rezneck</label>
            <text syncTime="146.647" offset="741206">On the circumstances presented to the D.C. Court of Appeals, each one was not permitted to take the D.C. bar examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.175" offset="767329">That is correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.579" offset="772971">Now, that requirement of graduation from an ABA approved law school prevails in most jurisdictions in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.797" offset="801810">Its validity has never been undermined by any court, to my knowledge, and when an effort was made to challenge it here several years ago, this Court held that the challenge did not present a substantial federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.790" offset="869833">The second route for admission to the D.C. bar is admission on motion of a person who is a member of a court of general jurisdiction of any other state or territory, and who has been engaged in the practice of law for five of the eight years preceding the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.953" offset="958441">This is Subsection (c) of the Court's Rule 46 that we have been dealing with.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.825" offset="981951">I would point out to the Court that teaching at an ABA approved law school qualifies under this rule as being engaged in the practice of law, and Mr. Feldman, as his brief indicates, has been doing that for some period of time at Rutgers Camden, which is an ABA approved law school.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.505" offset="1064707">In other words, Mr. Feldman can be admitted on motion to the D.C. bar after the specified time period.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.907" offset="1090307">He is not forever barred from the D.C. bar by the fact that he did not graduate from an ABA approved law school.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.607" offset="1121131">The third route is that a person who is a graduate of an unaccredited law school is eligible to take the D.C. bar examination upon completion of 24 credit hours in an ABA approved school.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.820" offset="1193961">This is the so-called 24-hour rule, which is involved in Mr. Hickey's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.989" offset="1218620">There are six ABA accredited law schools in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.923" offset="1238369">There are two in Mr. Hickey's home state of Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.890" offset="1254251">There are 172 in the United States as a whole, and 24 credit hours at any one of them is sufficient to satisfy the Court's 24-hour rule, and Mr. Hickey is still entirely eligible to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.010" offset="1322692">Thus, there are several different routes into the D.C. bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.288" offset="1347769">The one route which we submit is not available is for a frustrated bar applicant to go to the United States District Court and obtain a coercive order against the D.C. Court of Appeals, nullifying a prior decision of that Court, and requiring it to abandon its own rules for admission, and that is what both the Respondents have attempted to do here.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.558" offset="1448916">I would like to identify for the Court several important interests which we regard as being at stake in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.822" offset="1477964">First, and I suppose most obvious, is the interest of the D.C. Court of Appeals in maintaining its independence and its authority in a matter which has been expressly confided to it by Congress, admission to its bar, and the governing statute here, I think, is about as explicit as it could be.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.502" offset="1552674">This is Section 2501 of Title XI of the D.C. Code:</text>
            <text syncTime="354.483" offset="1572632">"The District of Columbia Court of Appeals shall make such rules as it deems proper respecting the examination, qualification, and admission of persons to membership in its bar. "</text>
            <text syncTime="367.712" offset="1625503">And I want to emphasize that we are not talking here about admission to the bar of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which are entirely free to regulate their own bars as they see fit, and they do so.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="385.674" offset="1697392">Mr. Rezneck, do you think your case stands on any different footing than if you were representing the highest court of a state?</text>

            <text syncTime="395.045" offset="1734800">Yes, I do, because of the Court Reorganization Act, Justice Rehnquist.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="398.716" stopTime="401.698">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="398.716" offset="1749533">In what respect does it stand on a different footing?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daniel_a_rezneck" startTime="401.698" stopTime="467.500">
            <label>Mr. Daniel A. Rezneck</label>
            <text syncTime="401.698" offset="1761445">I think that considering the history of regulation of the bar in the District, which was originally confided to the U.S. District Court as a court of general jurisdiction, you had a considered judgment by Congress expressed in that statute transferring that jurisdiction to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals as the highest court of the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.784" offset="1853814">I think it is a question of what implications can fairly be drawn from that transfer of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.484" offset="1876592">I would point out that there is precedent in this Court under the Court Reorganization Act, specifically the Swain versus Pressley decision by Justice Stevens on behalf of the Court several years ago, which construed a different provision of the Court Reorganization Act as conferring less jurisdiction on the federal district court here than would be true on federal district courts elsewhere in the country because of the provisions and the intent of Congress in the Court Reorganization Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.675" offset="1993307">So, I do think that we stand on a different and on a stronger footing here in the District for an absence of jurisdiction in the federal courts.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="467.500" stopTime="489.273">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="467.500" offset="2024654">Well, suppose before Alaska was admitted to the Union it had the same kind of a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.294" offset="2051822">Once it was admitted... that is, the federal courts, territorial judges performing certain functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.587" offset="2080974">Once it was admitted to the Union, it comes in on an equal footing with all other states, and also with equal burdens, does it not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daniel_a_rezneck" startTime="489.273" stopTime="626.310">
            <label>Mr. Daniel A. Rezneck</label>
            <text syncTime="489.273" offset="2111694">Then it is a state.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.318" offset="2123920">It would depend, of course, as to whether the Act of Congress had anything to say about control over admission to the bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.065" offset="2150878">Normally that would not be the case when a state is admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.517" offset="2164671">Here we do have a statute which deals explicitly with the subject of control of admission to the bar, and of course there isn't any Congressional statute applicable anywhere else in the United States except in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.808" offset="2213885">So that we have that statute to interpret and apply here, particularly in the light of the prior history in the District of Columbia of regulation of the bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.993" offset="2246591">As I was indicating, the D.C. Court of Appeals is not in any sense attempting to control the bars of other courts in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.769" offset="2293716">Mr. Feldman, for example, is a member of the bar of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.861" offset="2318062">His name appears on briefs in cases in that court, and in the reports of decisions in cases in that court.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.312" offset="2343871">While he was in Washington, he was eligible to practice in the Federal District Court here, because he was associated with a member of the bar of the Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.730" offset="2385562">In other words, we are concerned solely here with admission to the local bar, and that is the right to practice in the local court system and to hold oneself out as admitted to the general practice of law in the District of Columbia, and we submit that the decision below overturns or undermines one of the pillars of the Court Reorganization Act of 1970, which was the transfer of jurisdiction over the local bar from the federal court to the U.S.... to the D.C. Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.106" offset="2519100">And I would suggest that a few lines of the history here are instructive, because as I think this Court knows from its prior decisions under the Court Reorganization Act, and as I certainly well remember when I came to Washington to practice 20 years ago, we had this unique hybrid court system here, where you had a federal court system that was a court of general jurisdiction, not limited jurisdiction, you had a local court system that was entirely subordinated to the federal court system, and you had a local bar which was under the control of the U.S. District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1965.880" offset="8018189">We have not presented our position on the merits of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.269" offset="8031773">The issue that we have addressed both in the District Court and in the Court of Appeals is the jurisdictional issue, and I think that that is the issue which is now before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.717" offset="8081510">I do want to point out that Mr. Feldman was admitted in Virginia, and subsequently in Maryland, after passing the bar exams of both states, and he decided to become associated with a law office here in the District of Columbia, and as a result, and quite naturally, he sought admission to the District of Columbia bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.722" offset="8189552">Upon filing his admission papers with the committee on admissions, he was informed that the rule, Rule 46 of the Court of Appeals barred Mr. Feldman at the threshold from being considered for admission to the bar, because the rule required graduation from an ABA accredited law school, and Mr. Feldman had not attended such a school.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.178" offset="8315358">Mr. Feldman nevertheless felt that his qualifications were good, that he had had a thorough legal education.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.049" offset="8358826">He had a commitment to the standards of the profession, and he hoped that he could find some way to persuade the bar admission authorities in the District of Columbia to consider his qualifications on their merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.759" offset="8433641">The committee on admissions advised Mr. Feldman that the only way he could be considered for admission to the bar was if there were a waiver of the requirement of graduation from an ABA accredited law school.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.143" offset="8507201">It further advised Mr. Feldman that there was one body and one body only in the District of Columbia that could grant such a waiver, and that was the D.C. Court of Appeals itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.011" offset="8574702">Mr. Feldman's next step was to submit a petition directly to the Court of Appeals asking the court to waive the requirement of ABA... graduation from an ABA accredited law school and consider his individual qualifications, and I would like to stress what issues were raised by that petition and what issues were not, because I think that these are the matters on which the jurisdictional issue before this Court will turn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.493" offset="8748677">Mr. Feldman in his petition asked solely for an exercise of discretion by the D.C. Court of Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="2952.701" offset="11965500">Well, though, I think, Your Honor, with deference, that the threshold question is whether the causes of action are the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.386" offset="11992249">If the causes of action are the same, the issue is not... if the causes of action are different, excuse me, the issue is not one of res judicata, but collateral estoppel, and then the question is not what issues could have been raised, but rather what issues were in fact raised and decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.096" offset="12087022">Now, I would make one further point in that connection which is, let's assume that the causes of action are absolutely the same in the waiver petition and the District Court complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.573" offset="12152955">Let's also assume for the sake of argument that the denial of the waiver petition was action taken in an administrative capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.616" offset="12193079">We would still say that Mr. Feldman was entitled to do precisely what he did, which was to put the D.C. Court of Appeals on notice that he planned to raise Constitutional claims, reserved those Constitutional claims for litigation in federal court, and then thereafter asked for a federal court decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.917" offset="12294329">So, I think that if the Court does find it necessary to address the res judicata issues, which we don't think are before the Court for decision, there is not just one, but several grounds for concluding that there is not a res judicata bar to considering the Constitutional issues raised by Mr. Feldman's complaint.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael F. Healy</label>
            <text syncTime="3075.151" offset="12455244">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, we requested the opportunity to present a brief argument this afternoon on behalf of Mr. Hickey because of certain important distinctions between Mr. Hickey's case and that of Mr. Feldman.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.909" offset="12538313">Again, since Mr. Rezneck did not take the opportunity to highlight any of the facts, let me take a few moments to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.547" offset="12564854">After a distinguished, a long and distinguished career in the United States Navy, Mr. Hickey decided to retire from the Navy, having attained the rank of Commander, and to enter into a new profession, the practice of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.057" offset="12618875">In March of 1975, he enrolled the Potomac School of Law, a newly established law school here in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.006" offset="12650640">In fact, Mr. Hickey was a member of its first class.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.427" offset="12664328">Potomac was not accredited by the American Bar Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.597" offset="12681046">Indeed, because of its newness, it had not even been through the extensive ABA accreditation process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.033" offset="12706751">However, the D.C. Court of Appeals had followed a practice for some time of granting waivers from its requirement that applicants for the bar examination be graduates of an accredited law school.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.777" offset="12753771">In the spring of 1978, Mr. Hickey applied for such a waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.776" offset="12773729">The petition submitted on Mr. Hickey's behalf emphasized certain aspects of his qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.819" offset="12801941">It also emphasized his many years of service to the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.458" offset="12820436">His Navy career spanned 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.097" offset="12835064">He received numerous decorations for valor in connection with almost 200 combat missions as a Navy fighter pilot.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.672" offset="12861291">It emphasized his age... at the time he was 47 years old... his family situation, and the resulting need to embark on his new career as soon as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.497" offset="12900684">What it did not emphasize or address in any way was a claim of a present right to admission to the bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.743" offset="12937673">It did not raise any legal arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.195" offset="12947391">The D.C. Circuit so found.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.600" offset="12961079">Petitioners in this case do not really contest that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.755" offset="12985634">Instead, what they claim is that Mr. Hickey should not, and it is their words, Mr. Feldman because he did not present any claims to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.406" offset="13032236">Now, whether Mr. Feldman presented them in such a way as to make his act judicial or not, I think Mr. Sussman has addressed that, and I don't think that they were, but in Mr. Hickey's case, there was no presentation of any legal arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.088" offset="13079048">Petitioner's contention that he is nonetheless barred from Federal District Court is very intriguing in that light, since the fundamental basis of their decision that the action of the D.C. Court of Appeals in Mr. Feldman's case was a judicial act is the presentation of this letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.080" offset="13155012">No letter was submitted in Mr. Hickey's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.594" offset="13165043">Having said that, I think we have to look back at certain fundamental principles of federal court jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.187" offset="13195449">It is beyond dispute that had no action been taken to the D.C. Court of Appeals, had Mr. Hickey gone in the first instance to Federal District Court, the Federal District Court would have had jurisdiction to entertain his claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="3326.831" offset="13462003">I think if one looks at the cases of Key v. Doyle or Swain v. Pressley, as cited by Mr. Rezneck, if one looks at the Senate report and the House of Representatives report in connection with the passage of that Act, that the intention of the statute was to make the D.C. Court of Appeals at best equivalent to the highest courts of the various states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.791" offset="13545804">With respect to the comity claim that he also makes, I don't think there is really any difference, but in fact the D.C. Court of Appeals is still a creature of the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.068" offset="13578927">It is not a state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.162" offset="13583316">So, if anything, it is less than a state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.754" offset="13593660">So I think that issue drops out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.644" offset="13605258">Having said, and I think the cases support us, that Mr. Hickey could have gone in the first instance to District Court, Mr. Rezneck still argues that the Summers case applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.061" offset="13650921">Again, the fact that Mr. Hickey never raised his Constitutional claims takes us out of the Summers case entirely.</text>

            <text syncTime="3717.579" offset="15024961">One will see such questions, for example, this Court must give him some opportunity to show that his unique training and experience have provided him with adequate qualifications to practice law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3730.370" offset="15076161">A flat rejection of Mr. Feldman's application without according him that opportunity would represent the very kind of irrebuttable presumption that the Supreme Court and the United States Court of Appeals have expressly condemned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3741.725" offset="15121510">The District Court found explicitly that he did more than seek a Rule 46 waiver.</text>

            <text syncTime="3762.187" offset="15203430">If you look at his own complaint, which I think may be the best evidence on this, his own complaint in the District Court, Page 41, and he is describing the proceedings in the D.C. Court of Appeals, and he says,</text>
            <text syncTime="3774.245" offset="15251600">"Finally, counsel argued that on its face and as applied, Rule 46 violated both the United States Constitution and the federal antitrust laws insofar as it conclusively denied admission to the bar to all persons except graduates of an ABA accredited law school. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3789.316" offset="15311890">I think the record is clear here that he did raise those questions, that he certainly could have taken them to this Court on certiorari from the decision of the D.C. Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3797.985" offset="15346581">He did not do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3798.969" offset="15350552">He sought a bypass or a short circuit by going to a Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3803.796" offset="15369882">And I do not think that is permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3805.905" offset="15378241">With respect to Mr. Hickey in that regard, while Mr. Hickey did not articulate his claims in the same way, I think a fair reading of his petition will show that Mr. Hickey claimed before the D.C. Court of Appeals that he was qualified to take the D.C. bar exam.</text>
            <text syncTime="3823.008" offset="15446682">Judge Robb, who dissented in the U.S. Court of Appeals, said that he could see no difference in Constitutional principle between a claim of right of admission to the bar and a claim of right to take the bar exam, and that each tendered an issue before the D.C. Court of Appeals which was reviewable here, and was not brought here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3843.953" offset="15530483">I just wanted to comment in conclusion on the point raised by Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3848.951" offset="15550441">If this Court should find that the decision of the D.C. Court of Appeals in each of these cases was a judicial determination, which we submit it was, what the result should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3859.805" offset="15593908">We submit that the result should be a reversal of the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals and a reinstatement of the judgments of dismissal of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3869.660" offset="15633301">That is so for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3872.754" offset="15645631">It would be an effort to relitigate in the District Court a judicial determination by the highest court of the state, and there is clearly no subject matter jurisdiction in the federal court to do that under a long line of cases, and alternatively, it would be res judicata either on the theory that the same facts and theories in essence were pleaded in both courts, or alternatively, that all theories could have been pleaded in the D.C. Court of Appeals and were not and are still barred by the doctrine of res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="3901.148" offset="15759211">So, either way you go on that question, once you conclude it is a judicial determination, I submit that the result here should be a dismissal of both cases, which is what both district court judges found should be done.</text>
