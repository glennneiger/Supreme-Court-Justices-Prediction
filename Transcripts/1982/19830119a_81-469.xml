            <text syncTime="67.692" offset="394323">The petitioner in this case filed a complaint containing a Bivens-type complaint in a state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.308" offset="484811">The respondent, who like the petitioner is a civilian employee of the Federal Government, obtained the removal of the case to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.519" offset="557641">From that point forward, the government, for all intents and purposes, appears to have been cast in the role of defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="129.599" offset="641964">The petitioner's Bivens-type claim was that the respondent had violated the petitioner's First Amendment rights by participating as chief conspirator, if not principal procurer in the concocting and consummating of the petitioner's demotion under color of federal law and by virtue of the positions which the conspirators held.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.734" offset="854496">The avowed intent and purpose of the conspiracy is to punish the petitioner, to strike back, to retaliate, to pervert official power from its proper purpose for having publicly observed and spoken up about what he perceived to be rampant waste at George F. Marshall Space Flight Center in North Alabama.</text>

            <text syncTime="243.438" offset="1097330">The record reflects in a truncated fashion, since this comes up from summary judgment, the record reflects that the petitioner made some efforts within the organization through his representative in the manpower office to obtain some alleviation as to his personal problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.971" offset="1187401">And at... as he observed that he was not alone in being misclassified or a round... or a square peg in a round hole, it ate on him.</text>

            <text syncTime="326.109" offset="1427936">This lawsuit, the Bivens claim and all, was already pending, not before the administrative proceedings had begun but they were pending concurrently because an Alabama statute of limitations would, in my judgment, possibly have cut off one of the claims that is not present before the Court had the suit not been filed when it was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.743" offset="1530545">I say not present before the Court, it's not included within the petition.</text>

            <text syncTime="359.080" offset="1559907">As I understand the government's brief in this case, the government concedes what it candidly describes as petitioner's well... the well-established constitutional right which the petitioner asserts.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.279" offset="1656664">What the government disputes is the petitioner's right... or is whether the petitioner has a Bivens-type remedy for the impairment of that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.640" offset="1726150">In effect, the government currently, in defense of an opinion rendered on remand by a Court of Appeals, currently espouses the second branch of the Carlson against Green formulation as to whether an alternative remedy or as to whether there is a basis for barring or defeating at the threshold a Bivens-type claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.769" offset="1898663">And that second ground, of course, is that Congress had manifested its intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.323" offset="1924785">I don't want to get into an area of semantics, but it specifically... explicitly states, but I will say clearly manifests its intent that an alternative remedy which it has adopted is intended as a substitute for a Bivens-type action and is viewed by Congress--</text>

          <turn speaker="kenneth_s_geller" startTime="1609.329" stopTime="1890.426">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="1609.329" offset="6560893">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.083" offset="6583881">The fundamental flaw in petitioner's position is that it starts from the erroneous premise that a cause of action for damages based on an alleged constitutional violation is an essential ingredient of the constitutional right itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.528" offset="6649605">Based on this faulty assumption which confuses rights and remedies, petitioner asks as he did a moment ago why should federal employees be deprived of this right when state employees, for example, in a comparable situation would be able to bring a personal damages action in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.573" offset="6725882">And the answer is an obvious but nonetheless extremely important one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.144" offset="6744063">State employees can bring suit because Congress in Section 1983 has expressly legislated a cause of action for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.213" offset="6772380">Now, Congress has not done so with respect to federal employees such as petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.034" offset="6795681">Instead, Congress has set up an elaborate and comprehensive administrative mechanism, followed by judicial review, as a means of remedying adverse personnel decisions in federal employment, including personnel decisions alleged to be based on some unconstitutional motivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.829" offset="6870810">Now, this administrative scheme can provide adequate make-whole relief, and it represents the product of literally a century's worth of careful balancing of the rights of federal employees and the demands of the federal employment relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.207" offset="6940400">And we submit that it would be an unwarranted intrusion into an area plainly reserved to Congress if this Court were to create an additional damages remedy superimposed on top of the remedy Congress has provided, absent any statutory authority to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.269" offset="7012602">Now, this case is, of course, merely the latest in a series of constitutional damages actions that this Court has considered in the dozen years since Bivens was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.160" offset="7060145">But it's important to realize at the outset that this case is fundamentally different from any of the prior cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.414" offset="7089193">This case is unlike Bivens itself because in Bivens Congress hadn't addressed the remedial question at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.586" offset="7121899">The argument made in Bivens was that the claimant in that case should be relegated to his remedies under state tort law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.756" offset="7150529">And this case is also unlike Davis against Passman because in Davis the claimant was expressly included... excluded by Congress from a comprehensive statutory remedial scheme and would have been left entirely remedyless absent the Bivens action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.468" offset="7225448">Finally, it is unlike Carlson against Green because in Carlson Congress had set up a judicial remedy that was not designed with constitutional violations in mind and was plainly intended to serve as a complement to rather than as a replacement for a Bivens remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.993" offset="7291486">Now, in each of these cases, before allowing a Bivens remedy, the court ensured that Congress either had not addressed the question of what remedy to provide or had addressed it in a way that was not intended to occupy the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.891" offset="7367136">The court, in effect, was legislating interstitially.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.759" offset="7382601">It was carrying out Congress' intent by providing a remedy in a case properly within its jurisdiction, but in a way that didn't frustrate Congress' primary lawmaking power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.751" offset="7426591">Now, the question here is very different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.352" offset="7436935">Congress has provided an express statutory remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.554" offset="7449788">That remedy is in the Civil Service laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.506" offset="7461595">And it's expressly designed to deal with, among other things, constitutional violations of the kind alleged by petitioner here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.326" offset="7488867">And Congress has done so in a comprehensive way that really leaves very little doubt that that remedy is intended to be exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.866" offset="7518960">We believe that Congress' intent should be followed here as well as it was in Bivens, Davis, and Carlson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.086" offset="7547903">Now, the Court has organized uniquely into Congress' intent in the past by essentially asking two questions: First, does there exist another federal remedy equally effective in the view of Congress?</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.095" offset="7599939">Second, if there is no other available remedy, are there nonetheless special factors counseling hesitation such that Congress couldn't have intended the courts to intrude into a particular area simply based on the power of the jurisdictional ground?</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.939" offset="7663260">And we believe that both questions lead to the answer given by the Court of Appeals in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1908.637" offset="7758137">I think the court might have done that on remand after this Court decided Carlson against Green because there was a statement in Carlson about requiring an explicit statement by Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="1972.294" offset="8012674">We argue both, we argue both of these points below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.680" offset="8022287">And as I say, there are really separate ways of answering the same question, which is: What was Congress' intent?</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.234" offset="8044439">Let me say that this is at bottom just a federal employment dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.888" offset="8067113">Petitioner was given a two-job grade demotion from GS-14 to GS-12 following a disagreement with officials in his agency about internal agency practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.545" offset="8113716">Now, his superiors claim he was demoted for publicly making false and misleading statements about his job that disrupted his agency's activities and undermined employee morale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.103" offset="8159900">And petitioner claims on the other hand that he was in fact demoted simply for justifiably criticizing his superiors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.423" offset="8189262">This is the sort of dispute that in the private sector would be resolved internally or by contract or arbitration or something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.596" offset="8225938">And in the federal employment sphere as well, the court has been extremely deferential to the executive branch and to Congress in settling these courts of... these kinds of internal employment disagreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.705" offset="8278392">So even in the absence of any guidance by Congress, we think that this is an area that counsels hesitation in the implication of a Bivens remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.061" offset="8319770">But here we don't have congressional silence at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.263" offset="8332622">What we have is an extremely elaborate, comprehensive, adequate system of administrative and judicial remedies that Congress has set up precisely to deal with the sort of question that is raised in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.554" offset="8377761">Aggrieved employees can challenge adverse personnel actions, and including personnel actions claimed to violate their constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.326" offset="8408795">They can pursue... pursue those remedies through two layers of administrative review, followed by judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.163" offset="8440142">And if they eventually prevail, they are entitled to complete make-whole relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.217" offset="8456442">They can get back pay, as Mr. Bush did, reinstatement, restoration of all employment benefits, correction of any personnel records.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.173" offset="8492178">The Congress clearly thought when it was passing the Back Pay Act, it was passing complete perfecting legislation to make the employee whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.096" offset="8523943">And this Court said much the same thing in Samson against Murray and Arnett against Kennedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.917" offset="8547244">In fact, it's quite peculiar in a sense that the petitioners would argue that a Bivens action is more effective than... than what Congress has already provided for someone who claims... whose claim is based... basically an employment dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.907" offset="8603146">Someone who claims he was demoted or fired, it would seem that any remedy that didn't include something like reinstatement would be ineffective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.596" offset="8637941">And yet we're told here today that the only effective remedy is a constitutional damages action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.484" offset="8661451">Indeed, petitioner pursued these very remedies and, I said... as I said a moment ago, received reinstatement, back pay, and restoration of all benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.506" offset="8697605">Now, we submit that when Congress has spoken as clearly as it has here, there is simply no room left for the Court to legislate interstitially.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.128" offset="8732086">There is no need for the Court to create a damages remedy to vindicate constitutional rights, because Congress has already announced the remedy it believes should be applied in that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.253" offset="8772524">And that remedy is plainly an adequate one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.471" offset="8785376">If the Court's statement in Bivens, Carlson and Davis about Congress' ability to substitute for a Bivens remedy with something that it believes to be equally effective means anything, it has to mean that Congress can do what it did in this case in the case of federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.683" offset="8862281">And I think what the Court meant in Carlson when it talked about an explicit statement, requiring explicit statement by Congress, I don't think the Court meant anything more than Congress had to be legislating with the Constitution in mind, unlike, for example, in Carlson against Green, where the claim was that a tort claim remedy was a substitute for a Bivens action even though Congress in passing that tort claims remedy certainly wasn't legislating with the Constitution in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.686" offset="8978264">In fact, it wasn't even enough under the tort claims remedy to prove a constitutional violation, the plaintiff had to mold his claim into the form of a common law tort in order to recover.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.994" offset="9023508">But here the Civil Service remedies are clearly addressed to, among other things, constitutional violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.898" offset="9047123">In fact, as we point out, one of the early Civil Service laws, the Lloyd and Fallon Act, was passed to prevent the sort, the same sort of adverse personnel actions that petitioner Bush claims he suffered in this case, where Congress was concerned that Presidents Taft and Roosevelt had issued gag orders preventing executive branch employees from... from complaining to Congress about abuse or mismanagement in the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.279" offset="9144612">So we think that what Congress has done here is in... it is to pass a remedy that certainly in its view, and the Court said in Carlson against Green that it has to be equally effective in the view of Congress, not in the view of plaintiffs or even in the view of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.058" offset="9211799">And we think that that is what they have done here and that the Court of Appeals therefore properly affirmed the dismissal of petitioner's complaint for failure to state a cause of action directly under the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.365" offset="9257043">And we would ask that that judgment be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.332" offset="9264880">If there are no further questions?</text>
