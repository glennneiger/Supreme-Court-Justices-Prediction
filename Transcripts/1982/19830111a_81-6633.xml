            <label>Mr. James H. Lohr</label>
            <text syncTime="69.391" offset="412280">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case involves the revocation of an indigent's probation for his failure to pay a fine and restitution which was imposed as a condition of his probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.839" offset="470063">Mr. Bearden has received a three-year probated sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.777" offset="489811">The condition was that he pay $750 as fine and restitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.304" offset="507888">Two hundred dollars had to be paid almost immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.474" offset="520636">This was paid by his parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.817" offset="534011">Within the next four months, he had to come up with and pay the balance, which is $550.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.563" offset="564939">Approximately one month after this sentence was imposed, he was laid off.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.451" offset="592525">He became unemployed.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.498" offset="600675">From that period until the time of the revocation hearing, he did not gain employment, although the record shows that he tried to gain employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.011" offset="634739">He was without funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.945" offset="642471">He was without property.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.383" offset="648218">I think he was what we might call functionally indigent.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.772" offset="661802">The trial court held the revocation hearing and revoked it on two grounds, as I understand what the trial court did.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.705" offset="701508">It revoked it on his failure to pay the fine and restitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.767" offset="717808">Secondly, it revoked it on his failure to report to his probation officer regularly.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.828" offset="742050">That, of course, was not a ground stated in the petition to revoke.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.499" offset="760649">In fact, I don't believe there was any evidence to support that finding, and the Georgia Court of Appeals held that even if the trial court did rely upon the failure to revoke the probation... or revoke the probation for his failure to report, that the revocation rested upon an alternate independent ground which was sufficient, and that was that he failed to pay his fine and restitution, which was a condition of his probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.312" offset="875901">The Georgia Supreme Court denied a petition to review this discretionary appeal, and there are two other important factors I should mention in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.247" offset="927728">First of all, the petitioner was serving his probation under what we call the Georgia First Offenders Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.276" offset="951761">Under that Act, when a person is convicted or enters a plea of guilty, the court suspends further proceedings and places him on probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.052" offset="990944">If he successfully completes his term of probation, he is discharged without an adjudication of guilt, no criminal record, no criminal purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.159" offset="1023336">On the other hand, if his probation is revoked, the trial court then at the revocation hearing enter an adjudication of guilt and sentence the defendant to any sentence that it could have originally imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.979" offset="1078611">In this case, it would have been 20 years for the burglary and ten years for the theft by receiving.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.822" offset="1097942">The only condition is that he must be given credit for the time that he was on probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.319" offset="1123960">Now, in this case, when the trial court originally revoked his probation, it sentenced him to five years to serve.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.677" offset="1153426">It was a three-year term of probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.315" offset="1160009">It sentenced him to five years to serve.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.253" offset="1167741">On a motion on behalf of the defendant, this was reduced to the remaining balance of his probation, in line with the Georgia case of Stevens versus State.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="271.765" offset="1221762">Mr. Lohr, do you think that a sentencing judge can at an original sentencing proceeding consider the fact that the defendant is indigent and couldn't pay a fine, and therefore decide to sentence the person to jail?</text>
            <text syncTime="291.302" offset="1299921">Would that be valid?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. James H. Lohr</label>
            <text syncTime="294.160" offset="1311310">In lieu of a fine?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="295.551" stopTime="330.897">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="295.551" offset="1316953">The sentencing judge, who has options available to him at sentencing, the possibility of a jail term, the possibility of a fine, the possibility of probation on condition that a fine is paid, can the sentencing judge decide that because the person in fact is unemployed and indigent, and therefore unlikely that he could pay a fine, and would be a poor risk on probation, should be sentenced to jail?</text>
            <text syncTime="330.020" offset="1454775">Is that all right?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_h_lohr" startTime="330.897" stopTime="502.078">
            <label>Mr. James H. Lohr</label>
            <text syncTime="330.897" offset="1458327">I think, if I might answer that question, if a high level of scrutiny is to be applied to this type of state action, I don't think it is okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.234" offset="1499601">If a low level is, then I think it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.672" offset="1509423">If I might explain, as I understand your hypothetical, the person could have been placed on probation except for the fact that he couldn't pay the fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.293" offset="1551846">That indicates to me that there is no additional threat to society.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.071" offset="1570967">There is nothing being achieved by protecting society simply because he was poor.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.194" offset="1591447">As far as rehabilitation goes, I don't think the state is achieving anything by putting him in jail for rehabilitation under these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.723" offset="1625615">Now, there is the element of deterrence, let's say, to other individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.954" offset="1642543">For example, other indigents may see this indigent... in their mind he may be getting off scot free.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.747" offset="1677651">In other words, he is not... doesn't have to pay a fine because he is too poor, and he doesn't have to go to jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.105" offset="1699072">There are other ways that the state can enforce or achieve the policy of deterrence other than the payment of a fine or jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.415" offset="1732404">Those aren't the only two options.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.053" offset="1738882">So, if we look at strict scrutiny, so to speak, it is not necessary to put him in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.489" offset="1760616">There are other less intrusive ways to accomplish that deterrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.112" offset="1775140">If we are looking at just a rational basis, then I think the judge can do it, so long as the fine is... or the jail term is in some way commensurate with the fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.264" offset="1811712">Now, the second point I just want to mention, that I am sure you are aware of, that the fact that his probation was revoked because he was too poor to pay the fine resulted in the adjudication of guilt which has several other consequences, among which he loses his right to vote, he loses his right to hold public office, and certain other rights that citizens who are not convicted of a felony of moral turpitude hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.786" offset="1941802">First of all, I would like to consider the cases of Williams versus Illinois and Tate versus Short.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.016" offset="1978791">This Court in the case of Williams versus Illinois held that it was unconstitutional to incarcerate the defendant beyond the limits of incarceration which by statute apparently the state determined as necessary to achieve the penalogical interests of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.599" offset="2073145">Now, in this present case, apparently the trial judge made a determination that this individual did not need to go to jail in order to satisfy the penalogical interests of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.953" offset="2122464">It wasn't a legislative determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.360" offset="2132182">It was apparently done by the trial judge.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="502.078" stopTime="518.865">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="502.078" offset="2143049">The trial judge, I take it, thought that what you referred to as perhaps inartfully, at least in my opinion, less intrusive methods might be used to achieve society's goal without having to send him to jail at that stage.</text>

            <text syncTime="520.802" offset="2217864">The probation and the other... and the conditions that were imposed upon his probation would satisfy the penalogical interests of the state.</text>

            <text syncTime="1647.012" offset="6722732">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, in this case, the petitioner raises an equal protection challenge to the revocation of his probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.367" offset="6752198">At stake is the broad sentencing discretion that this Court has often recognized to be vested in trial courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.318" offset="6776022">I would like to say at the outset that the equal protection issue here is not the typical equal protection question this Court faces.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.095" offset="6803085">Most equal protection issues involve broad, sweeping legislative action that is at least to some degree over-inclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.173" offset="6831402">Here we have a single sentencing decision by a single trial court, highly individualized, a revocation of probation which was an act of discretion by a trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.166" offset="6875392">That is one reason why the respondent submits that the Court should employ the reasonable basis test of equal protection review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.290" offset="6903813">Another is that the conditions this Court has specified in the past to the application of higher scrutiny are simply not met in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.895" offset="6934324">Strict scrutiny, we feel, would be inappropriate because there is no suspect criterion that is the basis for the state action here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.613" offset="6961178">Moreover, no fundamental right is burdened for equal protection purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.157" offset="6979359">A person on probation has no right, fundamental or otherwise, to probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.515" offset="6996809">Moreover, his fundamental rights may even be limited by his probationary status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.405" offset="7016348">As to intermediate review, this Court has reserved that level for the review of state classifications which are based on what some have called semi-suspect criteria, usually immutable characteristics, as gender or illegitimacy, but in this case there is no such characteristic that is the basis for the state action.</text>

            <text syncTime="1908.140" offset="7767212">Your Honor, I am saying it is reasonable to use... Let me put it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.606" offset="7781109">When a trial court is faced with sentencing a defendant, in this case deciding whether to put a defendant on probation or not, the trial court must make a prediction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.181" offset="7815382">Under Georgia law, he must decide under the statute whether it is likely that the defendant will again engage in a course of criminal conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.991" offset="7846624">Now, what is to help him make that prediction?</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.992" offset="7854670">I am saying that the financial resources available to the defendant and his employment history are two indices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.018" offset="7878807">They are imperfect, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.895" offset="7882255">I admit that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.737" offset="7885599">But they can rationally, reasonably be used to predict the future behavior of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.173" offset="7907437">That is the whole reason why they are considered in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.374" offset="7920185">Now, that is the primary position of the respondent, that financial resources and employment background are a reasonable indication of likely probation success of a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.132" offset="7991238">Let me illustrate my argument by making a comparison to two other cases decided by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.910" offset="8018301">In Vance versus Bradley and Massachusetts Board of Retirement versus Mergia, the Court considered mandatory retirement schemes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.282" offset="8051842">The Court held that the mandatory retirement schemes were reasonable and therefore not unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.779" offset="8077860">This Court said that, even though there were employees under both of those schemes who could still perform the tasks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.324" offset="8107953">In other words, it was reasonable for the Congress in one case and the Massachusetts legislature in the other to use age as an index to the physical capabilities of workers, even though there are exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.132" offset="8155183">Similarly, in the case before the Court, the respondent submits that it is reasonable for a trial court to use financial condition and employment history as an index to the likely probation success of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.249" offset="8207741">That is the whole purpose for considering those elements, not only on revocation, but also in the original sentencing decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="2307.005" offset="9362771">In the case of Ross versus Moffitt, this Court summarized some previous decisions of the Court that dealt with state actions which had erected insurmountable barriers to indigents seeking a review of their criminal convictions, and in Ross versus Moffitt, which Justice Rehnquist wrote, the Court said that although those prior cases could be fit... they could be fitted under either the due process or the equal protection clause, that the Court considered them to be best explained under the equal protection clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="2346.959" offset="9522536">In those cases, this Court decided that the additional punishment imposed upon indigents solely because of their indigency served no legitimate state interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="2360.063" offset="9574990">Well, the equal protection clause, I would say.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.857" offset="9590141">The Court pointed out that when the two defendants in those cases were sentenced, there was a declaration by the state that the state's penal interests did not require the additional punishment later imposed upon the indigents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.038" offset="9646879">Now, in the case before the Court, I submit that there is no... even assuming that analysis, there is no declaration by the state that the state's penal interest is satisfied here without imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.079" offset="9707065">You have to remember, this is a probation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.516" offset="9716783">Tate versus Short and Williams versus Illinois were not probation cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.455" offset="9732561">This defendant, this petitioner was put on probation, which is a conditional release, and he has to comply with certain conditions of probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.169" offset="9771431">So, it is a tentative release.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.637" offset="9781253">Moreover, in this case, the petitioner was put under the First Offenders Act of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.352" offset="9800061">The Georgia Supreme Court has said in a case called State versus Wiley, which is at 233 Georgia 316, that the purposes of first offender's probation are not the same as ordinary probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.175" offset="9855441">The Court has said that unlike other probated sentences, the defendant is not merely serving his sentence outside the confines of prison, but is serving a period on probation to determine whether or not the prisoner may be rehabilitated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.233" offset="9903611">So, first offender's probation in Georgia is even more tentative than ordinary probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.731" offset="9925658">So I submit we don't have a declaration here as in Tate and Williams that the state's penal interest was satisfied without imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.225" offset="9963588">Now, I would like to also point out to the Court that the revocation in this case can rationally be argued to help maintain public confidence in the criminal justice system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.878" offset="10018236">Surely, public confidence would seriously be eroded if a person like the petitioner could not only escape imprisonment, but even escape a conviction without having kept the conditions of his sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.275" offset="10095767">And this concern is especially great here, because the petitioner was sentenced under the First Offenders Act of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.943" offset="10138504">Not only will he escape imprisonment, but also a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.739" offset="10157625">Respondent submits that to maintain public respect for the administration of justice, this revocation, this state action here can rationally be seen as furthering that interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.813" offset="10206004">In summary, Your Honor, what we have here is a trial court faced with a difficult sentencing decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.793" offset="10233903">The trial court was faced with a defendant who had plead guilty to burglary and theft by receiving charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.416" offset="10264414">He has no prior felony convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.834" offset="10274027">He says that he can pay a small fine and restitution, and he appears to be employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.504" offset="10296701">Based on those premises, the trial court places him on probation, gives him a very lenient sentence, and even gives him the benefit of the First Offenders Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.003" offset="10334735">Eight months later, the petitioner comes back in for revocation of his probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.702" offset="10353544">He has failed to keep the conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.435" offset="10364411">He has not paid his fine and restitution, and is now unemployed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.201" offset="10383532">Now, a lot of questions could be asked about the trial court's decision to revoke probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.212" offset="10403594">It could be asked whether it is wise, enlightened, progressive, humane, but those are not the issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.412" offset="10428358">The issue is, was the decision arbitrary, was it irrational?</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.883" offset="10442255">The respondent submits that whatever might be said about the decision of the trial court, it was clearly rational.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.644" offset="10469318">Therefore, it meets the dictates of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the judgment of the Georgia Court of Appeals should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2597.827" offset="10526056">Mr. Chief Justice, I have just a couple of points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.196" offset="10547477">First of all, as I understand the state's position, it is that the petitioner's loss of his job and his inability to pay his fine and restitution placed him in the position of being easily led to commit another crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.882" offset="10598259">I disagree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.193" offset="10603483">I believe it is a false assumption, the one that was disapproved of in Griffin versus Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.346" offset="10624068">And the state seems to be riding a different horse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.252" offset="10635666">It is not saying that the failure to pay the fine and the restitution was... caused him to be a greater threat to society.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.829" offset="10665968">It was his indigency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.623" offset="10673178">In other words, the real reason for the revocation of his probation was his indigency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.809" offset="10693971">With regard to public confidence, it is hard to pin down, but it seems to me that people are not going to have much faith in a criminal justice system that puts an individual in jail because he is poor and under the same circumstances when a rich person is going to be able to go free.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.426" offset="10768368">In Rodriguez, this Court reviewed Griffin, Douglas, Williams, and Tate, and in Justice Powell's opinion it was stated that where a person because of lack of wealth was completely unable to pay for a benefit, and as a result there was an absolute deprivation of that benefit, that the Court has struck down those types of state actions, and I submit that in this case, because of his lack of wealth, he was unable to pay for the benefits which flow from being on first offender's probation, and that he was completely deprived of those benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.367" offset="10904205">For these reasons, I would respectfully submit that this Court should reverse the Georgia Court of Appeals.</text>
