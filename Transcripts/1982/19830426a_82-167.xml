            <text syncTime="57.180" offset="358916">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.132" offset="374798">There is but one issue in this case and that is whether military personnel may be permitted to maintain a damage action against their superiors for alleged constitutional torts.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.125" offset="438746">The Ninth Circuit held that they may, at least under certain circumstances, and we ask this Court to reverse that ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.185" offset="470929">The respondents were five black enlisted men who were serving aboard the guided missile destroyer, U.S.S. Decatur.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.665" offset="516904">They sued their superiors from the chief petty officers immediately above them on up to the commander of the ship and charged that actions taken by those superior officers were racially motivated and therefore that the Equal Protection rights of the respondents were violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.248" offset="619200">The actions in question were actions taken in the ordinary course of military command.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.198" offset="646994">They involved assignments to particular parts of the ship or to particular duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.619" offset="668728">They involved performance evaluations.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.945" offset="681998">They involved minor punishments for actions taken aboard the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.753" offset="709270">And they involved scoldings, or in the words of the record below, being chewed out by their superior officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.375" offset="743752">The District Court dismissed, on the motion of the defendants, but the Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.435" offset="775934">In doing so, the court recognized that permitting an action such as this to be maintained had serious drawbacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.243" offset="811252">The court agreed that the mere maintenance of such an action can be disruptive of military discipline.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.333" offset="843539">And the court also expressly recognized that permitting a civilian court at the beginning of such a process to review the internal disciplinary mechanisms of the service... of the military services could usurp military functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.295" offset="919399">But nevertheless the court held that a constitutional damage action could be maintained and that the superior officers were not entitled to absolute immunity, and then it remanded the case to the District Court to consider whether this particular case could continue in light of a four-part test which the court promulgated.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.362" offset="1019709">The decision of the court below, if allowed to stand, means at least two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.860" offset="1045727">First it means that every military commander is subject to damage suits by his or her subordinate for any command decision taken with respect to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.589" offset="1104555">And secondly, the decision below is flatly inconsistent with the whole approach this Court has taken to intra-military suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.569" offset="1152516">And it is extremely troublesome in its impact.</text>

            <text syncTime="288.697" offset="1285009">First, under the Bivens case and the cases following Bivens, this Court has consistently held that no constitutional damage action will be implied if special factors counsel hesitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.863" offset="1341642">Well in this case, the special nature of the military command structure, as framed by Congress, and its operation, are the special factors which counsel hesitation in implying a Bivens remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.450" offset="1412068">And secondly, under the Butz decision, this Court has held, and in cases following Butz, this Court has held that there should be absolute immunity afforded to governmental officials if those officials have special functions.</text>

            <text syncTime="405.525" offset="1752392">The Wilkes case, which was the 1851 decision of this Court which recognized that, at least at that time, a military superior could be sued by essentially... for essentially assault and battery, is distinguished on several grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.486" offset="1824176">First of all, that case did not deal with a constitutional tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.079" offset="1842566">The question whether there was a Bivens type action, whether a governmental official could be sued for a constitutional tort, was not decided by this Court until 1971 in the Bivens case itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.479" offset="1900140">Secondly, the Wilkes case, to the extent it can be read as permitting a nonconstitutional tort action, is inconsistent with Barr against Matteo.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.910" offset="1957923">And third, that case really arises in a different era.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.705" offset="1981015">It arises in an era when the military was much smaller, did not have the elaborate system of review that has been promulgated by the Congress since then.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.778" offset="2025319">It is inconsistent with this Court's decisions in Feres and Stencel Aero, which we discuss in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.775" offset="2053322">It is not, in our view, necessary for this Court to overrule the Wilkes against Dinsman case in reversing the Ninth Circuit, because it did not deal with a constitutional tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.224" offset="2107134">But we feel that for all those reasons it is not controlling.</text>

            <text syncTime="504.298" offset="2147468">For instance, under the Mindes case and others, what the courts have held, including this Court, is that the intra-military actions are ultimately reviewable, judicially reviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.760" offset="2201280">Here there were a number of courses of action that were open to the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.820" offset="2225521">They could have sought action from the Board of Corrections of Naval Records.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.833" offset="2249554">They could have sought Article 138 proceedings against their superiors and they could have sought other remedies to deal with the particular things they were complaining about.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.564" offset="2292499">At the end of those processes, had they availed themselves of them, and had the carrying out of those processes not been done in accordance with the statutes and the regulations in the Constitution, there would have been ultimately judicial review under the rules laid down by this and other courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.649" offset="2368881">But that is a wholly different situation from the one we have here where before taking any of those actions, this suit was filed and, as the record shows, as the joint appendix showed, they took only in desultory fashion, one or two half-hearted steps in these directions.</text>

            <text syncTime="705.154" offset="2950890">Having found that, the Court refused to imply that military personnel could sue their superiors, could sue the government under the Tort Claims Act for actions by their superiors.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.742" offset="3005224">And that, we think, shows that this Court has paid a special deference to Congress in this area of intra-military disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.270" offset="3043363">The Court has been reluctant to add remedies onto those specifically applied by Congress in this area because of the fact, and the Court has stated it over and over again, the threat of disruption of military discipline is so great.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.434" offset="3112013">The military, after all, is a unique institution in our life.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.386" offset="3131761">It is the only institution that is designed to be prepared to send men into combat.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.304" offset="3159451">This Court has recognized over and over again that that single fact makes the military command function and military discipline an overriding concern and one that the Court should be very hesitant to disrupt.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.002" offset="3222250">The particular case before us, I think, is a classic example of why the Court should refrain from fashioning a new remedy here.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.294" offset="3259448">The plaintiffs were sailors on a ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.528" offset="3276375">As the record shows, that ship was about to embark on a five-month voyage to the Indian Ocean right at the beginning of the Iranian crisis.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.507" offset="3316290">That meant, obviously, these men would be in very close contact with their superiors during, perhaps, very hazardous circumstances for a long period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.753" offset="3365296">To import into that situation the added artificial disruptive effect of an ongoing civilian lawsuit between the subordinates and their superiors could not possibly have anything other than a disruptive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.354" offset="3431647">And it is for that reason, the very fact that the existence of the lawsuit can disrupt the functioning of the military discipline process that we especially urge that the court's decision below was incorrect.</text>

            <text syncTime="900.498" offset="3732264">Well, it would be our position that it does not reach actions by federal officials in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.637" offset="3752744">There has been no decision by this Court on that subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.635" offset="3768731">I think, however, that if you look at the legislative history of that 1871 Civil Rights statute, you will not find anything suggesting it was designed to go against the federal government or federal officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.770" offset="3829335">The statute talks, on its face, about persons in territories in the states which would tend to suggest it wasn't meant to so imply, so apply, but there is really no definitive holding on that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.654" offset="3884819">What we would say, in any event, is that the Court really does not have to reach that question, that under cases such as Butz and Carlson against Green, if this Court were to hold that a Bivens case would not properly lie because it should not be implied because special factors do counsel hesitation, that that same reasoning should apply to 1985(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="966.707" offset="3997041">Both because of that and also because under Feres and other cases, this Court has been reluctant to imply new remedies in intra-military suits.</text>

            <text syncTime="1010.829" offset="4173525">Those are all subject to review under Article 138 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.529" offset="4200379">There were minor punishments involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.308" offset="4215425">For instance, one of the actions mentioned in the papers prominently is a $50 fine for one of the men's having left his clothes out in the work space just before an inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.492" offset="4264222">That was subject to the informal review procedures within the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.802" offset="4285433">In short, every single action here was subject to review under those provisions and also, I think, perhaps even more important, under the Naval, Navy's Equal Opportunity Program and its regulations, which expressly bar discrimination in any form within the Navy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.529" offset="4364323">I would like to just make one more point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.491" offset="4436212">The number of times that this Court has dealt with intra-military suits it, in each case, has pointed to the fact that going too far in fashioning new remedies would have an intrusive and disruptive effect on military discipline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.701" offset="4525028">And in each case, it has pointed to the fact that the military has its own internal system of justice, which has been fashioned by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.288" offset="4571422">We believe those decisions make total sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.381" offset="4587722">They make complete sense in this case where, I think, everyone agrees that the implication of a damage remedy would have the greatest personal impact on the military command process and therefore we urge that the decision of the Ninth Circuit be affirmed... be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1546.503" offset="6316297">So, we feel that Seaman Wallace here had been intentionally discriminated against by Commander Chappell, by Lieutenant Commander Viafore and by Lieutenant Jordan where they intentionally kept him out of OI Division after he had been approved to go into OI Division by the Personnel Development Board, which is a board of five chiefs who make a determination if a person is qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.911" offset="6441894">The five chiefs said Wallace is qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.410" offset="6451925">In addition, his division officer said yes, he is qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.206" offset="6467076">He should be in the Operations Intelligence Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.595" offset="6480659">Yet Commander Chappell, as well as Lieutenant Jordan, intentionally kept blacks out of the Intelligence Division, because they felt that they could not trust black people there, because they did not want blacks in positions of authority and responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.652" offset="6544816">And so, as a result of that, they transferred him out, they transferred Wallace out into the area of the Deck Division.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.459" offset="6588075">And essentially, he was required there to chip paint as well as to swab the decks, which is the traditional role of black people in the Navy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.737" offset="6625169">Historically they have been kept either as stewards or as people who worked in decks and unskilled jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.969" offset="6654112">In addition, he had been threatened, Wallace had been threatened by his division officer on more than one occasion to be transferred out because of the fact that he was speaking up about the treatment of blacks on that ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.838" offset="6721613">Also, Wallace had been subject to the actions of Klan sympathizers on the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.742" offset="6753169">Some sympathizer hung a noose in his work space.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.192" offset="6775007">The noose has been the symbol of lynching of blacks for a long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.879" offset="6789740">This caused great consternation for Seaman Wallace, put him in great fear and caused him great humiliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.859" offset="6817639">This was done in the presence of Lieutenant Jordan, as well as Chief Parks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.591" offset="6844597">They knew that it was there, yet they didn't order it down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.653" offset="6856823">They did not bring the responsible people to task.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.825" offset="6869570">And Wallace complained to them and they did nothing about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.371" offset="6883676">In addition, there was numerous graffiti in the work spaces that the Klan put, including KKK&gt; ["].</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.275" offset="6915337">This was reported to Lieutenant Jordan, to Commander Chappell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.429" offset="6931951">They took no action to clean up, to clean it up or to get the responsible people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.971" offset="6966119">And the respondents were involved in trying to essentially clean up the ship in that sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.562" offset="6992450">Ensign Shannon also was discriminated against.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.810" offset="7013453">He had been threatened by Lieutenant Bianco, to be killed by Lieutenant Bianco because he left a door open.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.245" offset="7039262">And also, he was given a low evaluation because of the fact that he had been complaining about the treatment of blacks on the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.506" offset="7076251">After the suit was filed, there were more threats by these officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.959" offset="7094119">Hickey was threatened to be sent to Deck Division because of the fact that he filed the suit and the others were essentially required to be in dangerous conditions, including Lemmons and Richardson, because of the fact that they filed the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.921" offset="7161933">Moving on to the argument, we think that first, it appears that the government, in their reply brief, concedes that in cases involving unconstitutional conduct by officers are reviewable in federal court for injunctive and declaratory relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.803" offset="7249495">And that's on page two and footnote two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.020" offset="7258272">So we think, in this case, that essentially they accede the question of jurisdiction of a federal court over these issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.126" offset="7290769">In addition, we feel that they accede the question of justiciability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.576" offset="7320548">So the sole question here, we feel at this time, is the question of damage remedies and we feel essentially that, in this particular case, that the plaintiffs, the black sailors should be treated the same as any other litigants in federal courts and they are entitled to damage remedy for violation of their constitutional rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="1839.638" offset="7488777">We think that the damage remedy is the narrowest form of remedy in the courts and we feel that the injunctive relief that the government said it doesn't oppose is much more intrusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.162" offset="7550844">It's much more intrusive into the military because of the fact that it orders the military--</text>

            <text syncTime="2057.364" offset="8359699">And we think that essentially the remedy exists under Bivens for these black servicemen, but the government essentially is trying to deprive these black sailors of the right under Bivens by saying that Congress never, Congress never provided a remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2091.038" offset="8494387">But even more, we feel that Congress has spoken in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.598" offset="8512672">In 1976, it issued a statute, 10 USC 1089, which essentially gave absolute immunity to military medical personnel for any acts that they perform in the military and only makes the government responsible for their acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.622" offset="8592712">Well, at that time, Congress recognized that officers of the military are subject to liability, otherwise they would not have had to pass this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.414" offset="8635866">And we feel that by doing so, if it intended to preclude liability, it would have included all officers in there.</text>
