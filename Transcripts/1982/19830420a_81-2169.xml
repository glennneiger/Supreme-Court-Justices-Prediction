            <text syncTime="55.397" offset="374582">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case presents the issue of whether a person who pleaded guilty in state court to making illegal drugs and who did not raise the validity of the search that produced the essential evidence of that crime can later bring an action under 42 United States Code Section 1983 claiming that that same search was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.791" offset="500179">The issue in this case can be stated perhaps even more narrowly.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.056" offset="521286">Can the 1983 action be brought even though the Respondent, Mr. Prosise, had numerous opportunities to raise the validity of that search in the state court?</text>
            <text syncTime="105.470" offset="574889">Can he bring this action even though he has never claimed that he had inadequate counsel?</text>
            <text syncTime="113.655" offset="607595">And can he do so even under the circumstances where he tried to withdraw his guilty plea, claim his innocence, and even then not raise the validity of the search?</text>
            <text syncTime="127.257" offset="662034">The error of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals is that it adopts as a policy--</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="134.097" offset="689410">Mr. Lasso, I take it there was no motion to suppress in the Circuit Court.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_r_lasso" startTime="139.969" stopTime="317.401">
            <label>Mr. David R. Lasso</label>
            <text syncTime="139.969" offset="712920">--That is correct, Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.269" offset="714070">At no time was there a motion to suppress.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.624" offset="723474">As a policy matter, the Fourth Circuit has adopted a rule which encourages the accused to bypass the very state processes which are designed to protect the important constitutional rights embodied in the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.071" offset="793273">In effect, the Fourth Circuit has sanctioned a rule which allows the abuse of those state processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.990" offset="829008">That kind of flat rule of non-preclusion does not advance concerns of finality of judgment, conservation of judicial resources, avoidance of vexatious litigation, and it certainly does not further any interest of federal-state comity.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.685" offset="907794">Now, the essential facts in this case are very straightforward.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.638" offset="927542">Mr. Prosise entered into a plea agreement with the commonwealth.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.338" offset="942380">He agreed to plead guilty to the manufacturing of phencyclidine, or... also called PCP or angel dust, in exchange for the dropping of a charge of possession of PCP.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.287" offset="998177">During the guilty plea hearing, which included testimony from Detective Allen, who conducted the search and obtained the warrant, and all the evidence that he found, the trial judge said, and I quote, very briefly,</text>
            <text syncTime="227.060" offset="1061289">"The court finds there is a sufficient factual basis, and upon the evidence heard this morning the court finds the defendant guilty of the manufacture of phenclyclidine as charged in the indictment. "</text>
            <text syncTime="242.055" offset="1121266">Now, over a month later, the sentencing hearing took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.850" offset="1140388">During the sentencing hearing, Mr. Prosise testified in his own behalf and began to claim his innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.282" offset="1174138">He claimed that there was one essential drug not found in his apartment that would produce PCP.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.563" offset="1199216">Therefore he was innocent.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.108" offset="1205485">The trial judge said,</text>
            <text syncTime="264.827" offset="1212277">"I will consider this as a motion to withdraw the guilty plea. "</text>
            <text syncTime="268.762" offset="1228055">He said, "I will deny the motion".</text>
            <text syncTime="271.511" offset="1239026">Quoting again, very briefly, the judge said,</text>
            <text syncTime="275.727" offset="1255954">"The commonwealth had a good, strong case that formed the factual basis for the plea. "</text>
            <text syncTime="280.976" offset="1276956">"It was quite clear if the defendant had been exposed to trial, he would have been convicted by a jury. "</text>
            <text syncTime="287.331" offset="1302347">Again, at no time was a motion to suppress ever made, and the lower court never mentions the crucial importance that this search played in the conviction of Mr. Prosise.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.642" offset="1351562">Apparently this is so because the lower court simply finds such considerations irrelevant to its new rule that there will be no preclusion whatever in a guilty plea case involving a Fourth Amendment claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.587" offset="1415405">If that decision--</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="317.401" offset="1422615">Mr. Lasso, do you think that the absence of a motion to suppress played any part in the reasoning of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit?</text>

            <text syncTime="325.285" offset="1454171">--Well, yes, Justice Rehnquist, it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.520" offset="1471098">They simply... In other words, it was not litigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.564" offset="1479248">Therefore it could not come into play in the sense of Allen versus McCurry, so they avoided Allen versus McCurry in that way.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="339.405" offset="1510595">As you read the Court of Appeals opinion, does it reserve the question as to whether there would be preclusion had there been a suppression hearing, or does it say there would have been preclusion?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_r_lasso" startTime="348.979" stopTime="397.945">
            <label>Mr. David R. Lasso</label>
            <text syncTime="348.979" offset="1548943">I think it perhaps reserves that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.977" offset="1560960">It is very unclear.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.026" offset="1565139">It reserves the question also of what happens when you have certain affirmative defenses that could be made, affirmative defenses that would stop the prosecution altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.678" offset="1603696">It avoids that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.222" offset="1609861">What it says is that looking at the law, the law is developing into one major determining factor, and that is incentive to litigate, and if a person has incentive to litigate in the lower court during his conviction, then there should be preclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.043" offset="1689168">However, the mistaken assumption of the Fourth Circuit is that it simply isn't worth the effort for a District Court or a Trial Court to determine in guilty plea cases like this whether or not there is incentive.</text>

            <label>Mr. David R. Lasso</label>
            <text syncTime="399.848" offset="1752385">He was sentenced initially to 25 years in the state penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.223" offset="1769939">At the time he gave his guilty plea, the judge asked him, did he know that he could possibly receive 40 years in the state penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.174" offset="1801704">He said that he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.235" offset="1805988">He had been advised.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.126" offset="1813511">There isn't any question in this case, really, but that Mr. Prosise... excuse me, Mr. Prosise had every incentive in the world to litigate this search.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.902" offset="1852591">It could have been done easily, at no cost to him, and in a sense, his decision to forego making such a motion to suppress is really tantamount, I would think, to an admission that there would be no merit to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.458" offset="1914866">In any event, he chose not to do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="449.766" offset="1952065">Now, the other assumption of the Fourth Circuit... there are two others which are, I believe, mistaken.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.935" offset="1984770">The first is, is that this rule of non-preclusion is somehow consistent with Virginia law.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.010" offset="2009012">The other mistaken assumption is that Mr. Prosise and persons like him somehow have a right to be in federal court at least one time to raise these Fourth Amendment claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.973" offset="2068884">I believe that this Court in Allen versus McCurry laid that assumption to rest once and for all.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.235" offset="2093962">There is no universal right to be in the federal court to litigate Fourth Amendment claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.389" offset="2118517">The proper place for a claim in this case to have been raised would have been during the state criminal process.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.824" offset="2152267">Now, under 40... I'm sorry, under 28 U.S. Code Section 1738, the Virginia law of preclusion apparently should apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.008" offset="2193018">That appears to be the decision of this Court in Kremer versus Chemical Construction Corporation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3180.413" offset="12874697">Turning to the waiver question, I think the court was clearly incorrect and rather the Circuit Court is correct that there was no waiver arising from that, that the rationale for Tollett versus Henderson is that individuals should not be permitted to come into court and then contest the fact that they are actually guilty by way of habeas corpus in an effort to seek their release from custody to vacate and set aside the conviction itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.074" offset="12981276">Tollett, of course, was not a waiver case at all, as this Court has said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.043" offset="13001234">Tollett was limited to habeas corpus challenges to the conviction, and Mr. Prosise is not seeking declaratory injunctive relief that his conviction was invalid, but rather is seeking to litigate the entirely separate question of whether the police officers committed a violation of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.941" offset="13072809">I think Preiser versus Rodrigez, this Court made clear that habeas corpus and money damages under 1983 are entirely separate and distinct remedies, and that the policy considerations I think this Court indicated in Allen itself, the policy considerations underlying habeas corpus have no application to the 1983 context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.555" offset="13171239">So that the rationale supporting the Tollett decision precluding individuals from subsequently coming into court and contesting the validity of their conviction have no application in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.517" offset="13223066">I think, rather, if the Court is going to look at the waiver principle in the case, the Court should look at the Wainwright versus Sykes deliberate bypass considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.623" offset="13267474">I don't think that even in those cases that there arises a waiver from this, because in Tollett versus Henderson the Court said that where the individual waives or bypasses a state procedure that then forecloses them from habeas corpus relief, that you can't come and get habeas corpus relief in state... or, rather, in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.112" offset="13365485">But that is inapposite to this case because in Virginia there is no collateral estoppel preclusive effect to a guilty plea criminal conviction in a subsequent civil action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.970" offset="13412924">The criminal case and the civil case are two separate things.</text>

            <text syncTime="3409.834" offset="13792326">I think that there are significant policy considerations against applying the Tollett waiver rationale to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.048" offset="13829211">First of all, it would preclude Fourth Amendment issues if it were extended to 1983 actions that had no relief in state criminal cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="3505.842" offset="14176431">The decision below, I would submit, is consistent with the important governmental concerns in the enforcement of criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.948" offset="14220839">The purpose of criminal courts is not to enforce private rights, but rather to vindicate public interest in enforcing criminal laws, while, of course, at the same time safeguarding the defendant's individual rights by assuring the reliability of the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.130" offset="14281547">However, Fourth Amendment questions do not in any way raise into question the legality or the reliability of the state criminal conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.639" offset="14323552">I think that permitting collateral estoppel upon conviction in 1983 actions wouldn't... or rather, the purpose of 1983, rather, is to provide compensation for injured persons, deterrent to police officers, and redress for abridgement of constitutional rights itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.786" offset="14416130">The deterrence from the... the deterrent effect as to Fourth Amendment violations arises from a direct statement to the constable who has blundered that impermissible actions have occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.374" offset="14474540">An exclusionary ruling by a trial court does not have that effect, whereas a damage action against the police officers individually would have a more direct deterrent effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.808" offset="14520202">I don't believe that this harsh result should obtain in this case, primarily because there is a serious question about the incentive to litigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.443" offset="14566804">There are also serious questions about the adequacy of the full and fair opportunity to litigate, especially in cases such as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.582" offset="14599301">There was not a single charge arising against Mr. Prosise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.814" offset="14612257">There were four charges against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.252" offset="14621975">He was facing nearly 80 years in the penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.702" offset="14639843">The state, by offering a plea offer, if this Court were to extend the reasoning of the Petitioners, could by the expediency of making a good plea offer to criminal defendants, could insulate the state entirely from Fourth Amendment liability under 1983.</text>

            <label>Mr. David R. Lasso</label>
            <text syncTime="3644.381" offset="14730540">Mr. Chief Justice, a few brief remarks on rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.830" offset="14756349">The point was made that he had no opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3654.047" offset="14769201">I don't think that claim can be taken seriously.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.781" offset="14780173">There is no question here but that he had opportunity to make a motion to suppress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.155" offset="14801593">I think it also overlooks the fact of the ease with which a motion to suppress could have made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.340" offset="14826357">There is nothing complicated or difficult about making a motion to suppress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3673.245" offset="14846001">The other point made, which hints, and it was in response to a question by the Chief Justice, was the anomaly that will be created when you are dealing with the trial situation, and that is, if a person goes to trial and litigates the claim, then the Respondent would say that he is precluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3695.952" offset="14936803">However, what happens if that same person goes to trial, does not litigate the claim, what happens to that Fourth Amendent issue?</text>
            <text syncTime="3704.434" offset="14970762">The Fourth Circuit said in Cramer versus Crutchfield that is a waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="3708.871" offset="14988525">He cannot litigate that Fourth Amendment claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3711.884" offset="15000542">So the question is, what is the difference between Cramer versus Crutchfield when you have a trial and you don't raise the claim, and here, when you have a plea of guilty and you don't raise the claim?</text>
            <text syncTime="3724.426" offset="15050697">The police officers would submit that there is no practical difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3729.156" offset="15069609">There is no question but that in each instance a court can look and determine the incentive to litigate, and here, he had 40 years facing him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3737.856" offset="15104404">He had every incentive in the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="3740.075" offset="15113286">He could have litigated that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3742.075" offset="15121332">He chose not to do so, and the federal courts should not then be burdened with litigating before a jury the question of a search when it could have been litigated easily in the state court processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3757.068" offset="15181309">What needs to be clarified here is, this is a plea of guilty to manufacturing PCP.</text>
            <text syncTime="3763.877" offset="15208476">It is not a plea to possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="3765.753" offset="15216000">I don't think that it can be argued that there was sufficient other evidence here of manufacturing simply because his fiance in a fit of emotion said, he is making PCP.</text>
            <text syncTime="3777.608" offset="15263438">The trial judge said very clearly when the plea was made, the factual basis of the plea this morning that I am accepting is what I have heard today, and that was the evidence produced by the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="3790.430" offset="15314742">Later, Mr. Prosise tried to withdraw that plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="3794.913" offset="15332715">He tried to assert his innocence, and the trial judge said, once again, I will not allow you to withdraw your plea because I have already heard sufficient factual basis to find you guilty, and that is the evidence of the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="3810.624" offset="15395513">So, there is no question here but that that evidence was crucial, it was important, and that is what he was convicted on.</text>

            <text syncTime="3823.712" offset="15447862">It may have been too late, but he never even raised that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3826.150" offset="15457580">Once again, he failed to make the point that the search was illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3832.132" offset="15481508">If he ever claimed that, why didn't he make it?</text>
            <text syncTime="3834.741" offset="15491957">What this case really presents is a fundamental policy question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3839.521" offset="15511079">Should this Court endorse a rule which encourages litigants like Mr. Prosise to deliberately bypass the opportunities afforded to him in the state criminal process?</text>
            <text syncTime="3852.451" offset="15562801">Those same opportunities are designed to protect his civil rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3856.670" offset="15579728">They would allow him in the criminal context to challenge the conduct of the police officers.</text>

            <text syncTime="3886.470" offset="15698847">The fact is, however, the exclusionary rule does exist, but if it didn't exist, we would then be left under 1738 to in a sense begin to look closer at state law, what will the states do if the federal court eliminates the exclusionary rule?</text>
            <text syncTime="3903.558" offset="15767288">The state courts... I see that my time is up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3906.604" offset="15779408">In conclusion, I would simply ask this Court to adopt a rule of Judicial administration that will preclude Mr. Prosise from bringing his claim and ask this Court to reverse the Fourth Circuit.</text>
