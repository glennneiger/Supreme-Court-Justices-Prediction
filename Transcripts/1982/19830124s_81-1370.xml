            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="10.770" offset="135368">This case comes to us by way of an appeal from the Supreme Court of Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.958" offset="164102">It doesn't lend itself very well to a description from the bench.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.578" offset="186568">I think it will suffice to say that the case concerns intrastate gas contracts between the respective predecessors of the appellant producer and the appellee public utility.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.148" offset="240902">That these contracts contained an escalator clause and a price redetermination clause, and that the Federal Natural Gas Policy Act was in -- enacted in 1978 and replaced earlier federal price controls for interstate gas as well as extending federal price regulation to the intrastate gas market.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.470" offset="334107">And that a Kansas Act was enacted in May 1979 and imposed price controls on the intrastate market with respect to contracts executed before April 20, 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.427" offset="390009">And that the parties are in dispute as to whether the new federal Act triggered the escalator clauses and enabled the producers when the utility refused to go along with a higher rate to terminate the contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.264" offset="449360">In this litigation, a Kansas trial court entered summary judgment for the utility holding that the federal Act's imposition of price ceilings on intrastate gas did not trigger the governmental price escalator clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.894" offset="503799">And that the Kansas Act did not violate the Contract Clause of the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.469" offset="526160">That reading was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.051" offset="540475">In an opinion filed today with the clerk, we in turn affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court of Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.514" offset="570359">Justice Powell has filed a separate opinion which joins the Court's opinion and except as to Part II-C and he is joined in that opinion by the Chief Justice and by Justice Rehnquist.</text>
