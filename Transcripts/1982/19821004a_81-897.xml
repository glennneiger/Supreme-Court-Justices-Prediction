            <text syncTime="58.099" offset="372107">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the issue in this case is whether a worker injured upon actual navigable waters who would have been covered by the Longshoremen's Act prior to its amendment in 1972 retains that coverage, or whether Congress by amending the Act in 1972 restricted coverage for this class of amphibious worker.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.763" offset="462700">Respondent Raymond Churchill was injured in 1974 while standing aboard a crane barge engaged in unloading a caisson from a supply vessel during the construction of the North River Pollution Control Project, which is a sewage treatment plant that extends over the Hudson River in New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.768" offset="542739">He filed a claim for compensation under the Act, and after a hearing, the Administrative Law Judge denied that claim, concluding that he was not engaged in maritime employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.843" offset="583072">The Benefits Review Board by a divided vote subsequently sustained the conclusion of the Administrative Law Judge, and the Second Circuit denied Churchill's petition for review, concluding that his employment was not maritime as it lacked a significant relationship to navigation or to commerce on navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.021" offset="663738">There can be little dispute but that prior to 1972, Respondent Churchill could have claimed coverage under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.455" offset="697489">Prior to that date, the Act covered all work-related injuries occurring on actual navigable waters.</text>

            <text syncTime="176.083" offset="843983">Coverage prior to 1972 did stop at the water's edge, so Congress in 1972 amended the Act in part to eliminate the incongruities of this coverage rule by extending the coverage of the Act ashore for the first time to certain areas contiguous to the water's edge.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.447" offset="921410">The Act as amended also contained a second coverage requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.854" offset="939069">Not only must the injury occur on a covered situs, but the employee must meet a status test.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.787" offset="966863">Section 2(3) of the Act defines a covered employee as any person engaged in maritime employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.755" offset="998733">The proper application of this maritime employment status test to a traditionally covered amphibious worker is the question currently before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.966" offset="1039484">Proper consideration and analysis of this question requires careful attention to three important factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.417" offset="1073338">First, the term "maritime employment" itself has traditionally been construed as including all work actually taking place on navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.665" offset="1114298">Second, it is very clear from the legislative history of the 1972 amendments that Congress intended to retain this traditional coverage for longshore... for maritime workers and amphibious workers injured on actual navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.675" offset="1174380">Mr. Wilkins, could I go back for a moment to the point raised by Justice Blackmun?</text>
            <text syncTime="262.703" offset="1190471">Is it the government's position that although the propriety of the director's appealing to the Court of Appeals may be very much open to doubt in a case like this, it is the propriety of the director's petition for certiorari to review a Court of Appeals judgment is perfectly clear?</text>

            <text syncTime="1011.414" offset="4185358">Congress enacted the maritime employment requirement solely to limit the availability of the Longshoremen's Act to totally land-based workers who previously to 1972 had to rely solely upon state compensation acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.031" offset="4247843">It did not intend to restrict coverage of amphibious workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.685" offset="4262367">Indeed, the Senate reports state this conclusion forcefully.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.963" offset="4279503">Amended Section 2(3) specifically includes any longshoreman or other person engaged in longshoring operations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1045.914" offset="4323284">The navigation or commerce test utilized below not only ignores the traditional content of the term '72 amendments, but it leads to illogical results and has been shown by this Court to be impracticable and unworkable as a means of delineating coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.780" offset="4402801">The illogical and doctrinaire results created by this test are well illustrated by the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.558" offset="4429864">Respondent Churchill, unlike land-based workers who perform similar tasks, was constantly on, over, surrounded by navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.976" offset="4467585">He was faced with unique marine dangers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.178" offset="4480333">His work required the use of protective marine gear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.320" offset="4492976">It required knowledge of specialized techniques to deal with the exigencies of work on the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.441" offset="4513456">He was constantly required to load and unload supply vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.894" offset="4531219">Notwithstanding this unique marine nature of his activities, the court below looked to sewage treatment plant and asked whether it, not Respondent Churchill, had some connection to maritime activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.042" offset="4583882">The illogic of this result is made patent when this case is considered with another case arising from this same construction project, Mattson v. Perini North River Associates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.883" offset="4627245">There, the Second Circuit and the Benefits Review Board both upheld coverage for another worker involved in constructing this same sewage treatment plant who, like Mr. Churchill, was involved in driving caissons for the plant, doing very similar work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.846" offset="4687013">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.719" offset="4690566">Solely because Mr. Mattson was driving caissons at a portion of the plant that would subsequently be used to load processed sludge aboard vessels.</text>

            <text syncTime="1175.798" offset="4842912">Well, I can answer that, but to do that I need to go into a little bit of history, and I would like to do that right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.719" offset="4874573">The test, the navigation or commerce test was first adopted post-enactment by the Ninth Circuit in Weyerhauser Company v. Gilmore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.838" offset="4911040">The Court in that case stated that it was no help to consider the prior decisions of this and other federal courts that had considered the question of the proper state and federal jurisdiction under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.647" offset="4958269">The Court said that the 1972 amendments had instead instituted a clear line between state and federal jurisdiction, but in explicating this clear line, it explicitly relegated to limbo, in the words of the Court, the Davis and Calbeck decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.780" offset="5030785">But in its hasty relegation to limbo of all prior experience under the Act, it failed to recognize that the navigation or commerce test has been shown to be completely unworkable and impracticable as a means of delineating coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.303" offset="5092852">For nearly 35 years following the original enactment of the Longshoremen's Act, this and other federal courts struggled under the maritime but local doctrine to determine which employments on the water were maritime or possessed a significant relationship to navigation and commerce, and therefore fell within federal coverage, and those that lacked that elusive connection and therefore were maritime but local.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.685" offset="5194416">In 1942, in the Davis decision, this Court noted that the lines that had been drawn over the water were so fine, the decisions so confusing, that, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the Court stated that we could quote cases on either side, for recovery or against recovery, on the facts of the Davis case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.033" offset="5283755">In light of this terrible morass of cases that developed, the Court was forced to create the twilight zone within which state and federal remedies overlapped.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.765" offset="5326700">Twenty years later, in the Calbeck decision, this Court further overlapped state and federal remedies by declaring that federal jurisdiction extended to all injuries that occurred on actual navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.995" offset="5379676">The Court concluded that this was necessary to spare employees</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.961" offset="5395559">"the uncertainty, expense, delay of fighting out in litigation whether their particular cases fell within or without state acts under the local concern doctrine. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.707" offset="5442475">In short, all of the cases prior to Calbeck under the maritime but local doctrine demonstrate, and this Court finally recognized, that it was completely unworkable and impracticable to draw a navigation or commerce line between state and federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.434" offset="5521364">This Court, moreover, has been unwilling to relegate this experience to limbo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.382" offset="5541218">Two years ago, in the Sun Ship decision, the Court declined to draw a similar line between state and federal jurisdiction over land-based injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.974" offset="5575595">This case is very similar to the Sun Ship decision, and should be decided as the Court decided the Sun Ship decision, by harkening to the clarifying opinions in Davis and Calbeck, and refusing to recreate the jurisdictional monstrosity that those cases eradicated.</text>

            <text syncTime="1469.305" offset="6016855">For example, the court below rejected the argument that Respondent Churchill was engaged in maritime employment as a person engaged in longshoring operations... that is the statutory language... because he was required to load and unload caissons from supply vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.923" offset="6079340">The Fifth Circuit, however, on virtually identical facts, has concluded that such employees are engaged in maritime employment, and two petitions currently before the Court ask this Court to settle this particular controversy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1886.134" offset="7684199">However, certainly that section of the law is not relevant to the facts in this case, as the employer, Perini North River Associates, was covered by insurance contracts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1916.764" offset="7806765">And certainly even that section, which if it were interpreted to require the Director to provide information to potential employers under the Act, is subject to the same interpretation in that the Director does not have to agree with the information he imparts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2107.200" offset="8568496">In addition, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in the Donzi Marine case, which held that the Director could not properly petition a federal court for review, that circuit reaffirmed that analysis just recently in 1982 in the Miller case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.163" offset="8656372">Those decisions would seem to indicate that the Court of Appeals, at least the Second and the Fifth Circuit, have not seen this Court's action with respect to Director v.

            <text syncTime="2145.747" offset="8722618">The Director in his reply brief has argued that his interest in the proper construction and application of the Act is in and of itself sufficient to grant him standing each and every time that he, the Director, is of the opinion that a court has incorrectly adjudicated a particular claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.567" offset="8805897">By this argument he is asking no more than the right to seek the Court's advisory opinions whenever he disagrees with the lower court decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.407" offset="8841319">In this case, the parties with a personal stake in the outcome of the action have chosen not to litigate further.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.187" offset="8868382">In essence, what the Director is requesting is the right to certify questions to the Court without a case or controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.838" offset="8898997">The second issue presented today is whether Raymond Churchill, engaged in the construction of a substructure for sewage treatment plant, was engaged in maritime employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.255" offset="8956675">We submit that the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in denying federal coverage because Mr. Churchill's activities did not bear a realistically significant relationship to navigation or commerce on navigable waters was correct and it appropriately applied the occupational status test of maritime employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.074" offset="9048000">The Congressional language in the 1972 amendments clearly shows that coverage was premised upon an occupational status test and the geographical situs test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.584" offset="9098050">Simply stated, the Act requires that an injured worker be engaged in maritime employment on navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.487" offset="9125635">The legislative history and the Court, citing language from the legislative history in the Computo and Pfeiffer cases, clearly shows that some workers injured upon the covered situs would not be covered under the Act because they were not engaged in maritime employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.948" offset="9195435">The occupational status test cannot, we submit, appropriately be defined with respect to situs, and that is what the Director argues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.759" offset="9234723">It is the Director's contention that maritime employment includes employment upon navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.803" offset="9270876">In fact, the Director and the Fifth Circuit in the Thibodaux case appear to take the position that employment upon pre-1972 navigable waters was in and of itself maritime employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.779" offset="9326778">We submit, however, that this particular assumption, which was the basis for the Thibodaux decision, cannot be sustained by resort to the actual wording of the statute, nor can it be sustained by resort to an analysis of the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.224" offset="9408594">I call your attention to this Court's decision in Pennsylvania Railroad v. O'Rourke, wherein it was specifically stated that the coverage of the Act was not based upon the relationship of the employee to maritime employment, but rather based upon injury over navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.623" offset="9490200">The Court in that decision stated clearly, especially when it discussed the case of Parker v. Motor Boat Sales, that that individual would not be covered if the test focused upon the job that the employee was engaged for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.913" offset="9567314">Historically, the maritime employment standard clearly required some nexus to navigation and commerce over navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.392" offset="9617260">I think it is important, though, that a review of the statutory language itself does not support the Director's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.824" offset="9654981">If we define navigable waters by seeing that... excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.901" offset="9675252">If we define maritime employment by analyzing the term and stating that it is employment upon navigable waters, we do a serious disservice to Section 2, subdivision (4) of the Act, which uses both terms, "maritime employment" and "navigation and commerce".</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.969" offset="9763546">Section 2(3) always discusses maritime employment by resort to the nature of the injured worker's occupation and never based upon where the injured employee suffers that injury in the covered situs.</text>

            <text syncTime="2569.183" offset="10416398">The navigation and commerce test employed by the Second Circuit below does satisfy the clearly expressed Congressional intention to cover those workers in the class of its concern, again the class being those involved in industries relating to navigation and to the movement of cargo from water to shore.</text>

            <text syncTime="2612.853" offset="10591105">To read the Act as the Director suggests does harm, irreparable violence, in our view, to Section 2, subdivision (4), which now states that:</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.132" offset="10644186">"The term "employer" means an employer any of whose employees are employed in maritime employment in whole or in part upon the navigable waters of the United States. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.316" offset="10680966">To read that section with the Director's interpretation of the Act would change the language to be:</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.202" offset="10708447">"The term 1972, in whole or in part upon the navigable waters of the United States. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.585" offset="10769991">We submit that Congress in enacting the 1972 amendments and in using the two phrases, "maritime employment" and "navigable waters", intended to provide distinct and separate meanings to those phrases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.565" offset="10833939">Historically, the area of federal concern did relate to navigation and commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.342" offset="10865077">There is no question that in a number of decisions interpreting the 1972 Act this Court has, particularly when discussing the maritime but local cases, required a nexus between the activity and traditional concepts of navigation and commerce on navigable water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.380" offset="10957237">This Court's decisions in Calbeck and Nacirema make it clear that the scope of the 1927 Act required coverage for employees injured over actual navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.842" offset="11035082">It was clearly stated in the Nacirema decision that the language of the statute... that is, the language that Congress in 1927 employed... arbitrarily eliminated from coverage many employees whose work did affect navigation and commerce, particularly so in view of the advent of modern cargo-handling techniques which brought much of the longshoremen's usual work onto to shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.453" offset="11157440">The Court in Nacirema suggested that Congress could extend coverage shoreward based upon its power over admiralty contract jurisdiction, providing that the parties cover the status of the longshoremen performing that maritime contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.945" offset="11239464">And this Court's decisions in Executive Jet, decided after the 1972 amendments in 19... later that year... showed that the admiralty tort jurisdiction has now been rationalized with this Court's discussion of admiralty contract jurisdiction, so that both require a nexus to traditional navigation or commerce over navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.996" offset="11355657">The 1972 amendments show that Congress accepted this Court's invitation in Nacirema to cure the arbitrary application of the Act by providing that they will cover now for the first time the status of the injured worker and not simply refer to the location of that injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.579" offset="11453982">Congress therefore expanded the situs of coverage to eliminate the situation of shifting and fortuitous coverage, as was renounced certainly in the dissent in Nacirema and also alluded to by the majority opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.854" offset="11523049">For the first time, Congress confined the recovery to those individuals which it affirmatively described as the subject class of its concern, and the examples make clear that that class was individuals whose work affected navigation and commerce over navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.016" offset="11607686">Now, the Director has argued that the standard adopted by the court below, which is that the work must have some relationship, significant relationship to traditional navigation and commerce over navigable waters, is unworkable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.870" offset="11675186">But it is clear that in adopting the occupational status test Congress required that the inquiry be made in each case regarding whether this employee's activities are in the area that Congress was concerned with protecting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.018" offset="11747702">Even the Director's test would seem to indicate that the navigation and commerce test would be required at least, in his view, to those employees who were injured on the covered shoreside area, although he intends that a different test, a situs test of maritime employment, be used to determine coverage for injuries over pre-1972 navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.582" offset="11869955">The Director's test would arbitrarily, apparently, exclude from coverage an employee whose status... who would fail the maritime occupational status test while on shore, but apparently cover the same employee if he happened to fall into the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.577" offset="11946024">That is precisely the dilemma that Congress attempted to cure in the 1972 amendments by no longer focusing the area of concern on the situs, but rather looking to the actual work that the injured worker performed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.430" offset="12017391">We submit that the standard adopted by the court below is flexible enough to accommodate any new changes in cargo-handling techniques that injured workers may come into effect with, and we submit that the standard focuses upon the industry, the purpose of which Congress was concerned, that being the movement of goods in maritime commerce or navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.746" offset="12142674">I should also like to point out that the Director has made reference to one particular case in the Second Circuit which he indicates creates some conflict even within the circuit concerning coverage for employees at this construction project.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.722" offset="12206517">He mentions specifically Matson v. Perini North River Associates, but I think it is clear that the Second Circuit did not reach a decision on the merits in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.204" offset="12248522">Thank you.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard G. Wilkins</label>
            <text syncTime="3033.167" offset="12272346">Just a few points, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.122" offset="12284153">We'd like to make certain that there's no misunderstanding regarding the standing of the Director in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.054" offset="12315918">28 U.S.C. 1254 plainly allows the Director as a party to petition for a writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.084" offset="12344026">We were a party respondent below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.316" offset="12352907">There's no serious case or controversy question in this case because Respondent Churchill is before the case... is before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.718" offset="12386553">He will either receive or be denied benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.187" offset="12396375">This is not, as the Valley Forge case, as in the words in the Valley Forge case, a mere college debating forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.294" offset="12428871">We have very little to add on the merits of our case except to note that the Fifth Circuit in a recent en banc decision voted 12 to 2 to adopt in full the position of the Director.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.287" offset="12472862">As Mr. Justice Frankfurther noted in his concurring opinion in Davis:</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.350" offset="12489058">"Any legislative scheme that compensates workmen or their families for industrial mishaps should be capable of simple and dependable enforcement. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.893" offset="12523226">We urge this Court to adopt the common sense view that employment on the water is maritime, rather than becoming embroiled in formalistic inquiries as to whether particular employments possess that elusive connection.</text>
