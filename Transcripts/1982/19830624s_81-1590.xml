            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="92309">In 81-1590, Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products Corporation, the opinion will be announced by Justice Marshall.</text>

            <label>Justice Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="12.321" offset="141524">This case concerns the constitutionality of a federal statute which prohibits the mailing of unsolicited advertisements for contraceptives.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.134" offset="184782">The Youngs Drug Products Corporation manufactures prophylactic products.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.116" offset="208711">The company sought to mail to the public unsolicited advertisements promoting these products.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.485" offset="238177">The Postal Service notified the company that the mailings would violate federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.990" offset="264195">The company then brought suit in the United States District Court from the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.698" offset="287078">The Court held that the statute as applied to the proposed mailings violated the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.996" offset="316231">The Government brought this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.539" offset="326366">And today we affirm the judgment of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.339" offset="341622">In an opinion filed with the clerk, we explained that the company's advertisements constitute commercial speech and that we have held that the constitution accords less protection to commercial speech than to other constitutionally safeguarded forms of expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.790" offset="419467">However, because the company's advertisements concern lawful activity and are not misleading, the protection of the First Amendment is substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.839" offset="467636">The Government seeks to justify the prohibition on the mailing of the advertisements on two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.052" offset="496476">First, it argues that the law shields recipients of mail from material that they may find offensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.690" offset="531062">Offensiveness is not normally an acceptable justification for suppressing speech protected by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.729" offset="567215">And we do not think that it carries weight in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.419" offset="589889">Recipients have objectionable mailings can avoid the material simply by averting their eyes.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.995" offset="620191">The short journey from the mailbox to the trash can is an acceptable burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.095" offset="644642">The Government also contends that the statute aids parents' efforts to discuss birth control with their children.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.974" offset="676198">While this interest is a substantial one, the ban on unsolicited advertisings provides only marginal assistance to parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.648" offset="714859">At the same time it purges all mail boxes or material that is entirely suitable for adults.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.936" offset="744012">The Government may not reduce the adult population to reading only what it sees fit with children.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.398" offset="773896">The statute also restricts the free flow of truthful information bearing on the ability of parents to discuss birth control and to make informal decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.921" offset="819976">We therefore hold that as applied to the company's mailings here, the federal law violates the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.060" offset="856547">Justice Rehnquist has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in which Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.292" offset="885387">And Justice Stevens has filed -- also filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.979" offset="908165">Justice Brennan took no part in the decision of this case.</text>
