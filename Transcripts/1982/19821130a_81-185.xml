            <text syncTime="24.035" offset="250362">Dr. Simopoulos, a gynecologist, was inside with his staff and numerous patients.</text>

            <text syncTime="52.045" offset="362375">They in particular had a search warrant and seized the medical records of one young woman who has gone by initials during the course of this case, and I will continue to do so.</text>

            <label>Mr. Roy Lucas</label>
            <text syncTime="81.345" offset="479508">They are just background about the fact that he was then arrested, he was then charged under the particular Virginia statute, the Virginia Code 18.2-71.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.621" offset="516706">The statute defines as a felony any abortion "except as provided" in the other sections that are within the particular article.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.957" offset="554009">The statute is in its language remarkably like the statutes from 1848, the first statute up through 1970, except the earlier statutes were included in one paragraph, whereas... and this was significant to the Virginia Supreme Court... the current statute is in several different statutory sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.069" offset="630495">The indictment, which is set out in the jurisdictional statement, Pages 3 through 4, charged only the violation of the one statute, the 71 statute, which on its face declares all abortions illegal except as provided in the other statutory sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.982" offset="706146">The indictment did negate two of the separate sections, the section pertaining to the length of pregnancy and that the indictment alleged, and it was not contested, that pregnancy was in the second trimester.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.298" offset="751390">The indictment also negated the question of whether the abortion had been performed in a hospital or somewhere else.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.603" offset="776572">The indictment did not negate, however, the 74-1 section on medical necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.958" offset="810009">The prosecution theory, as expressed in the indictment and in the various arguments, particularly the closing argument at 449 of the Joint Appendix, was that the Commonwealth had only to prove some act by the doctor with intent to cause an abortion, and that that constituted the sufficiency of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.773" offset="897258">According to the prosecution theory, the crime was essentially complete when P.M. left Dr. Simopoulos's American Women's Clinic, provided that she later somewhere aborted, and provided that the prosecution was able to connect up the saline installation procedure with either the demise of the fetus or the abortion of the fetus.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.569" offset="992448">There was a bench trial in this case rather than a jury trial, at which numerous arguments were made, of which three have remained in our presentation to the Court here.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.605" offset="1040618">In pretrial hearings that lasted about a day and a half, the defendant put on evidence to challenge the constitutionality of the statute and to challenge the arguments to challenge the defects in the indictment and the definition of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.378" offset="1115642">We called various expert witnesses to deal with the question of whether there was any health or other basis for the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.054" offset="1150437">We had three gynecologists from Northern Virginia experienced with second trimester abortions, as well as one particular gynecologist who had conducted an extensive study on out-patient saline abortions.</text>

            <text syncTime="500.308" offset="2155420">I have no knowledge or basis in the record to think that a second trimester abortion has ever been performed in an out-patient surgical hospital, and that is something that was never even mentioned until this level.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.217" offset="2207038">The Virginia Supreme Court had no opportunity to interpret it, to even determine whether the out-patient surgical hospital question... I would anticipate that if we ever had an opportunity to respond to that issue raised at this point by the Virginia Attorney General, that we would be able to show that there are very few facilities licensed as out-patient surgical hospitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.221" offset="2291047">We would show that according to the Attorney General, they would not let Dr. Simopoulos obtain the type of license for second trimester abortions he had requested, because the Assistant Attorney General in the letter in the reply brief told him he would have to build a hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.188" offset="2350920">And I would submit to the Court that as far as this record shows, the only places where second trimester abortions are done, certainly in Northern Virginia, are in the two hospitals, the Fairfax Hospital and the Alexandria Hospital.</text>

            <text syncTime="594.739" offset="2533150">He was never required to apply for one.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.780" offset="2541300">I would presume that applies to non-physician owned type facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.054" offset="2558437">This was a physician's office that happened to be extremely well equipped.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.606" offset="2572647">The Commonwealth never required him to apply for it, and since it would be a misdemeanor for him not to if it was required, presumably he was operating a perfectly lawful place.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.932" offset="2613921">The evidence certainly in the record about Dr. Simopoulos's clinic would show that he had all of the facilities that would have met the requirements of the first trimester abortion clinic if there had been any reason for him to apply for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.781" offset="2669300">Certainly the testimony of the expert witnesses, I believe three of them actually went and viewed his clinic before they testified in order to be able to compare the type of facility that he had with the type of facility that they utilized at the Fairfax Hospital, and each of them testified that he had far more extensive equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.326" offset="2755504">He had the highest qualifications one could have, not only the training in GYN but the training in emergency medicine that he had, and he had the extra equipment that would be necessary that he preferred to have, equipment which was not at all present in the hospital context.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.617" offset="2824677">The requirement that abortions be done within the hospital stops at that point, and as the record in this case shows, the hospital simply used a standard treatment room with no special equipment in it whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.826" offset="2877444">One of the documents submitted by the Commonwealth in their submissions, in the Virginia addendum at Page 80, is the American College of OB/GYN Technical Bulletin from 1976, which points out that saline installation abortions can safely be done in a standard treatment room, and I would submit that shows to us that the facility that he had was far... in far better condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.754" offset="2981202">It also points out the low mortality rate from the saline installation procedure, and that it could even be cut in half using the various advanced techniques which there was testimony that Dr. Simopoulos was utilizing.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.803" offset="3037418">And that goes strongly in favor of cutting against any health interests which the state has offered, and the state has only made that contention pertaining to the health interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.620" offset="3080677">The Commonwealth at the pretrial hearing submitted no evidence whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.214" offset="3103038">They did not call a single expert witness in support of what burden they would have to show a health interest of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.680" offset="3140863">They didn't call anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.232" offset="3147132">They didn't call any witness of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.872" offset="3153715">And they simply did not make any attempt, and the Virginia Supreme Court in its opinion ruled what I believe is a clearly erroneous standard of review under the decisions from this Court that the burden entirely of showing the statute to be unconstitutional was on the defendant, on the physician.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.978" offset="3242113">The decisions of this Court have certainly indicated that, from Roe v. Wade onward, that the Commonwealth would have some burden of showing a maternal health interest, showing a compelling interest, showing that their regulations were narrowly tailored, that they were reasonably related to maternal health, and the Commonwealth in this case made no attempt whatsoever to meet that burden.</text>

            <text syncTime="836.970" offset="3502084">Roe did refer to the possibility of a hospital requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.202" offset="3514936">Roe did not squarely indicate that the hospital requirement would be considered valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.696" offset="3536984">At the time, as pointed out in the American Medical Association brief, there was very little evidence about the safety of second trimester hospital procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.512" offset="3572197">Abortion had been illegal in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.163" offset="3582855">There was no record, no evidence in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.165" offset="3594871">And the issue was certainly never addressed by anyone, and it was considered to be, I would think, a guideline from the Court as one of the possible types of regulations, as opposed to a definitive holding, since the second trimester hospital requirement was not at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.337" offset="3667491">Subsequently, in the Danforth case and the Colautti case, this Court has certainly carefully scrutinized the basis of restrictions and prohibitions in the second trimester abortion area.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.237" offset="3727155">In the Danforth case, where the Court had the question of an attempt by the state of Missouri to outlaw saline abortions, the Court carefully examined the basis for that attempted prohibition, and pointed out on the evidence in that case, as later in Colautti, that the saline installation technique was one of the primary techniques, if not the primary technique for that 15 percent or so of patients who find themselves in the second trimester, and that Danforth specifically pointed out that on that record at that time, the saline installation procedure had a lower mortality rate than that of childbirth, which was one of the important factors considered in the Danforth case.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.185" offset="3898936">Now, that was on a 1974 record.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.735" offset="3905101">There have been eight years of medical technology developments since that time, which would only enhance the position of the defendant in challenging the absence of any maternal health basis for the statute at present.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.424" offset="3967900">We argued in our first primary point with one of the criminal procedure questions, since the underlying statute need not be reached if the Point One or Point Two is persuasive to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.195" offset="4034982">The statute under which the doctor was charged criminalizes all abortions as construed by the Supreme Court of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.373" offset="4075629">It would allow the indictment of any physician for performing any abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.658" offset="4100811">The physician would then at least have to evoke and perhaps come forward with more in the way of proof that the abortion was justified under that particular subsequent statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.565" offset="4156399">This approach to the case, the Virginia Supreme Court did to avoid the other problems of United States v. Vuitch.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.031" offset="4190254">The United States v. Vuitch statute is so similar to the Virginia statute in many ways, except it is all incorporated into one paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.118" offset="4222646">The Virginia Supreme Court construed its statute as being different statutory sections, and therefore reaching a different result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.484" offset="4256082">As it was construed, however, the Virginia Supreme Court then ran immediately into questions that did not deal with the question of are you violating the constitutional rights of a physician and a patient when you allow a physician to be indicted under a statute simply for performing an abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.864" offset="4333614">If it is a first trimester abortion, it falls right in the language of that--</text>

            <text syncTime="1742.304" offset="7123387">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, Virginia respectfully submits that this Court may, and indeed that this Court should affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court of Virginia based upon the law and the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.723" offset="7181065">Only by substantially enlarging the Roe v. Wade right and restricting the state's legitimate interest may the Court have a basis for reaching a contrary result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.780" offset="7225264">Because the Virginia statute under attack in this case is drawn directly from the description in Roe of legitimate and permissible state regulation, we respectfully urge affirmance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.018" offset="7274270">As Mr. Justice Rehnquist has indicated, there are some difficulties with respect to standing in this matter, and we respectfully urge the Court to focus only on those factual situations in which Dr. Simopoulos has a personal interest at stake, and not to permit him to assert hypothetical bases for invalidating or alleging the invalidity of Virginia statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.484" offset="7376148">I believe that that is certainly consistent with this Court's opinions in Harris v. McPae and in the general line of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.270" offset="7407286">Eisenstadt v. Baird would, we believe, not be on point in this particular situation, because that case involved a situation in which the defendant in a criminal trial was permitted to assert the rights of distributees of contraceptives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.680" offset="7472905">Those persons who were receiving the product were not subject to criminal prosecution, and would not have a forum to assert their rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.656" offset="7508850">So, that took that particular situation out of the general standing proposition.</text>

            <text syncTime="3195.774" offset="12937304">Now, in this particular case, counsel for Dr. Simopoulos argued that the indictment was effective because it did not affirmatively negate medical necessity, and that was the argument which I believe the Court will find if it examines the transcript.</text>

            <text syncTime="3225.624" offset="13056631">Dr. Simopoulos we do not believe invoked that defense at trial, and how could he?</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.060" offset="13090381">He stated that the girl's condition was normal which he ascertained as a result of his examination of her.</text>

            <text syncTime="3259.297" offset="13191318">So, we submit that he has no standing to assert that issue at this time, but in any event, the Virginia Supreme Court has found that there was no medical necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.031" offset="13230293">That finding is certainly supported by sufficient evidence in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.226" offset="13251087">Also, the court's construction of the statute does not in any way implicate improperly presumptions or in key elements of a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.546" offset="13308347">Such was the case in Mullaney or in Sandstrom.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.989" offset="13330185">The defense is never required to shoulder the burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.614" offset="13356621">It simply has to invoke the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.256" offset="13367175">I think that that will make this particular situation fall well within this Court's decision last term of Engle versus Isaacs, where the defense merely had to invoke the defense of self-defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.422" offset="13415867">The prosecution then had to affirmatively disprove it beyond a reasonable doubt, and the Court concluded that even in those circumstances, that did not mean that on its case in chief, the prosecution had to disprove that as an element of the offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="3624.765" offset="14653235">If I may further reply to Justice Blackmun's question concerning whether she was told to return or not, under the Virginia Supreme Court interpretation of the statute, that might not make any difference, but on Page 187 of the Joint Appendix, she squarely admits that the doctor told her to go to the hospital if she had severe cramps.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.475" offset="14720109">She never threw away the instruction sheets, which were clear, and his two phone numbers 24-hour-a-day were circled in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3648.581" offset="14748530">This question about ambulatory surgical centers is extremely important, I think, to this particular case, and it is unfortunate there was no opportunity to respond to it in the lower courts or in the trial or to put on a full exposition of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3661.587" offset="14800566">Looking at the regulations, the Part 3 regulations on out-patient hospitals actually require more extensive extra technology than do the Part 2 on out-patient surgical hospitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.827" offset="14853438">In construing those regulations and reading them as to what do they contemplate, there is no indication whatsoever that the out-patient surgical hospital scheme contemplates second trimester abortions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3688.395" offset="14907772">There is no evidence that a second trimester abortion has ever been done in an out-patient surgical hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="3693.690" offset="14928984">The Commonwealth named four facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3695.882" offset="14937656">The Virginia Heart Institute certainly does no second trimester abortions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3699.652" offset="14952807">The Hampton General Out-Patient Emergency Center certainly does none.</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.616" offset="14968690">The Fairfax Surgery Center is in the community involved here, and was never named by any witness as permitting second trimester abortions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3711.380" offset="14999723">And there is another one in Norfolk, Virginia, that I know nothing about, except it is not in the list of second trimester abortions offered by the Commonwealth in its exhibits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3721.868" offset="15041624">They list no out-patient surgical facility that ever performed a second trimester abortion.</text>
