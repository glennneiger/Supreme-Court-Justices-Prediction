            <text syncTime="61.414" offset="386728">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="64.647" offset="399580">The Age Discrimination in Employment Act prohibits the federal government, with some exceptions, from employment discrimination based on age, regardless of the employee's age; and prohibits other employers engaged in interstate commerce from such discrimination against employees between the ages of 40 and 70.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.483" offset="478992">At issue in this case is the constitutionality of that provision of the 1974 amendment to that Act, which extended provisions to state and local government employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.462" offset="522878">Bill Crump, who was employed as a district game supervisor by the Wyoming Game and Fish Department was forced to retire at age 55, pursuant to a Wyoming statute which, with some exceptions, requires the retirement of all Game and Fish Department employees at age 55.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.705" offset="599887">Mr. Crump filed a charge of unlawful age discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which in turn filed this action in the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming seeking declaratory relief, back pay and liquidated damages for persons adversely affected by the state's retirement policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.588" offset="671358">The district court granted the state's motion to dismiss on 10th Amendment, National League of Cities and Towns versus Usery grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.757" offset="704063">Because the case comes to this Court in the posture of a granted motion to dismiss, there is no evidence in this record that either Bill Crump individually or Wyoming game wardens 55 years old as a group are, in fact, less fit to perform their duties because of the fact that they have turned 55.</text>

            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="180.507" offset="863096">The evidence in that case, as I recall, was that there was a general deterioration of certain physical abilities that were related to capacity to perform as members of the uniformed police force.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.502" offset="906982">And the evidence similarly was that as to Mr. Murgia, whatever his name was, that it had not happened in his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.280" offset="930179">Congress's congressional authority to extend the Age Discrimination in Employment Act to state and local governments can be found in either of two separate sources; the Commerce clause and Section V of the 14th Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.275" offset="990156">I will discuss each of them separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.477" offset="998933">With regard to the Commerce clause, the issue is whether the state of Wyoming has satisfied each of the three hurdles plus the balancing test specified by this Court in National League of Cities and Towns versus Usery and Hodel versus Virginia Surface Mining.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.922" offset="1068732">It is common ground that the ADEA regulates the states as states.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.888" offset="1092556">But beyond that, Wyoming has not made its case and cannot.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.278" offset="1110110">The reasons, which are spelled out in more detail, can be best summarized and put in most helpful perspective by examining just what it is that Wyoming seeks to do with its mandatory retirement program, and the impact of Congress's statute on the achievement of that objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.694" offset="1179805">The state itself has identified its goal.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.020" offset="1189105">It is, and I'm quoting from the state's brief,</text>
            <text syncTime="264.972" offset="1200912">"To assure the physical preparedness of Wyoming game wardens to perform their duties. "</text>
            <text syncTime="269.563" offset="1219302">The only effect of the congressional requirement on that concededly proper state goal is to require a tighter fit between the goal and the means for achieving it.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.340" offset="1270398">There are two basic approaches to the problem of eliminating from the work force those whose age impedes effective performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.929" offset="1304775">The first is a presumptive group approach, in which all members of the class are automatically swept out, notwithstanding the fact that everyone recognizes, as was true in Murgia, that some members of that group are under no age disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.048" offset="1381261">The advantage of this concededly over-inclusive approach is that it's easier to administer, and the court held in Murgia that it satisfies the rational basis test.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.777" offset="1424102">The other approach is to determine on an individual basis those particular persons who are and those who are not less able to perform because of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.663" offset="1467674">The starting point for analysis is that Congress has not prohibited the group approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.004" offset="1505082">The ADEA permits the mandatory retirement of groups as groups, rather than individuals as individuals, which of course is always available to the state, so long as the state can show that in fact, age is a bona fide occupational qualification for the group to which the dragnet is to be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.869" offset="1600481">The key element in proving a bona fide occupational qualification, according to the test that has been approved by almost all of the federal courts that have faced the issue, is proof that all or substantially all persons beyond the designated age are unable to perform the job safely and effectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.892" offset="1688566">Now, the sensible premise of this requirement is that if all or almost all the members of the group share the disability, then the group approach is appropriate to identify the disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.963" offset="1744886">Age is then a proxy for disability, because by hypothesis, it is shared by virtually all of the members of the group.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.304" offset="1778218">Therefore, under the ADEA, the state's very proper goal of weeding out the age-impaired from its work force can be achieved by either of two means.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.486" offset="1830985">One, a mandatory retirement program applicable to all members of the group if the state can show that, in fact, as to that group, the approach does identify the age-impaired with sufficient precision as to all members of the group.</text>

            <text syncTime="437.855" offset="1892425">General Lee, the Congress of the United States itself has imposed a mandatory retirement age for similarly situated federal personnel, as I understand it.</text>

            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="461.361" offset="1986466">I don't think so, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.611" offset="1995452">It is true that Congress, in its 1978 amendment, did consider the possibility of these little enclaves of federal employees whom it was leaving, who were still subject to mandatory requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.323" offset="2058355">And there was a proposal at that time to eliminate all of those.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.242" offset="2081970">It is fairly apparent from the legislative history, as is spelled out from our brief statements by Representative Spellman and Representative Hawkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.988" offset="2116974">The reason that that was not done is that some of these enclaves applying to such people as CIA, air traffic controllers, law enforcement and fire fighters and some others, were subject to the jurisdiction, the primary jurisdiction of other committees and they did not want to trounce on their turf before giving them an opportunity to pass on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.216" offset="2197849">But insofar as the constitutional significance is concerned, here I submit is the only significance of the fact that Congress has not extended this rule yet to all federal employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="533.364" offset="2274440">There certainly there was a policy decision by the Congress of the United States that there was an inherent impediment on foreign service officers after reaching the age of 60.</text>

            <text syncTime="553.341" offset="2354375">And what that shows is that either Congress or any other legislative policy-making body, including the state of Wyoming or including the state of Massachusetts, may conclude by legislative action that mandatory retirement programs are constitutional, or at least that they are required in the interest of the achievement of some state objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.892" offset="2456566">And if that's all you have, then it passes constitutional muster.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.234" offset="2473911">That's Vance versus Bradley, and that's Murgia versus... that's Massachusetts Board of Retirement versus Murgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.779" offset="2496168">What you have in this case applicable to Wyoming is an additional element, and that is a supervening legislative judgment that in certain kinds of contexts the line should be drawn with greater precision, and for reasons that I will discuss, Congress also has the right to make that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.442" offset="2586760">The only argument that can be made against it is that Congress has been under-inclusive, and particularly with respect to Congress's both Commerce clause judgments and also 14th Amendment judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.093" offset="2637438">The under-inclusive argument simply has not met with much success.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.029" offset="2665128">The most that you can say is that Congress has been somewhat inconsistent, or at least that it has not yet taken the ultimate step that complete consistency might indicate it should.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.431" offset="2706714">But that is not sufficient basis to render it unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="645.756" offset="2724060">How would compare the functions of a game warden with the functions of the officer involved in the Murgia and, I think, Feeney cases?</text>

            <text syncTime="655.769" offset="2764079">This... I think it would be difficult to imagine a case in which the case for mandatory retirement is less strong than it is in the case of Bill Crump, because he was not just a game warden; he was a game warden supervisor, which was basically a supervisory kind of responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.900" offset="2852582">And for that reason, I think that it does not rise to the same level as the foreign service employees in Vance, or the uniformed police in Murgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.239" offset="2893960">But that is not the controlling point.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.426" offset="2902737">The controlling point is that just as this Court very properly held in Murgia and Vance versus Bradley, that it does not violate the 14th Amendment for a policy-making body to adopt a mandatory retirement program.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.263" offset="2978074">And, just as for reasons that I will discuss, it is also constitutional for Congress, pursuant to its commerce and its 14th Amendment powers, to prescribe that in certain contexts to be identified by Congress more is required than the dragnet approach of the broad, overall inclusive approach is also constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.284" offset="3070130">The fact that Congress does both at the same time and that those exist side by side does not affect the constitutionality of either, because the constitutionality of both rests on separate grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.450" offset="3130839">That is perhaps best illustrated when we turn to the comparison of the state and federal interests, the final inquiry that is specified by Hodel and Usery.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.382" offset="3186532">On the state's side, the state's objective in maintaining a physically fit game warden force is left intact by the ADEA.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.174" offset="3225715">The only requirement is that fitness itself must be the inquiry, and unlike the Fair Labor Standards Act, the ADEA does not prescribe to the states any level of expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.607" offset="3267407">The countervailing federal interest by contrast is weighty; it is threefold.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.808" offset="3292275">The first is prevention of unnecessary unemployment and lack of productive capacity in areas of endeavor affecting interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.273" offset="3334071">Congress had before it evidence which indicated that the magnitude of that loss of productive endeavor throughout the United States was on the order of several billion dollars a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.955" offset="3380883">The second is the prevention of unnecessary demands on the federal Social Security system.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.844" offset="3400422">And third and perhaps most important of all was the prevention of arbitrary discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="1689.950" offset="6900830">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.417" offset="6914728">Wyoming enforces a mandatory retirement policy for two classes of individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.227" offset="6949941">They are both covered by the same Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.492" offset="6963002">It is the Act that is here challenged by the EEOC.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.412" offset="6974705">The Act covers Wyoming's highway patrol officers, and it covers those game and fish wardens for the state of Wyoming who are also full-time law enforcement officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.970" offset="7024860">It does not, as the Solicitor General suggests, cover most game and fish employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.201" offset="7049833">So we are talking, first of all, about Wyoming's treatment of its law enforcement officers, and only its law enforcement officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.714" offset="7079926">The Solicitor General predicates his argument on the premise that what we are concerned with here today is arbitrary discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.226" offset="7117960">Wyoming suggests that this is not arbitrary discrimination at all; that this is activity by a state which is a reasonable classification based upon age, and that therefore, the question for the Court's determination is simply whether or not the 10th Amendment to the United States Constitution, which embodies our constitutional federalism, reserves to the state of Wyoming the right to treat its law enforcement officers and to make fundamental employment decisions in exactly the same fashion that the United States Congress exercises its employment decisions with regard to federal law enforcement officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.145" offset="7301549">The position of the state of Wyoming is that under the Commerce clause, that Congress has no power to regulate the states in this fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.782" offset="7344181">Moreover, if the Court should reach the question of whether or not Congress has any power under Section V of the 14th Amendment, that that power is insufficient as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.465" offset="7386917">The requirements for determining whether or not this is an appropriate exercise of Congress's commerce power, of course, were set down by this Court in National League of Cities versus Usery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.147" offset="7445640">The tests are three.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.817" offset="7456298">The first, the Act must regulate the states as states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.972" offset="7472912">That test is conceded by the Solicitor General in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.892" offset="7488585">The second is that the Act must address a matter which is indisputedly a matter of state sovereignty.</text>

            <text syncTime="2565.164" offset="10401656">However, that doesn't mean that our record is devoid of evidence about what these people do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.130" offset="10421510">The court can judicially notice the statutes in the state of Wyoming which set certain of the requirements for Wyoming game and fish wardens who are law enforcement officers.</text>

            <text syncTime="2585.561" offset="10483263">That's poaching, license violations, the taking of an elk out of season.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.668" offset="10503743">It is not, it seems to me, a very severe leaving of the record to take the next step by implication and understand that those violations do not occur, by and large, on the streets of Cheyenne, Wyoming but rather, occur during hunting season in areas where hunting occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.425" offset="10590679">So it's clear enough from this record that the court can determine that the duties that are set by Wyoming statute for these particular law enforcement officers are strenuous indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.654" offset="10647625">Now, the lower courts have avoided the 10th Amendment constitutional challenge, and found that rather than this statute being an exercise of the 10th Amendment... excuse me, of the commerce power... they have assumed that Congress used its Section V power under the 14th Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.815" offset="10756295">The Solicitor General states that this Court's ruling last year in Pennhurst cannot apply to this case simply because it is clear from this statute that the Congress intended to regulate the states.</text>

            <text syncTime="2730.267" offset="11062136">The legislative history that the Solicitor General relies on in making his conclusion, it seems to us, is simply insufficient to reach the question.</text>

            <text syncTime="2895.000" offset="11721049">Now, the 14th Amendment grants to Congress basically three powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.715" offset="11747903">Of course, it grants the Congress the ability to prohibit conduct which in and of itself would violate the equal protection clause.</text>

            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="3223.775" offset="13036158">Just a couple of matters, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.601" offset="13043472">First, with regard to Mr. Salzburg's final argument, it's exactly the same argument that New York made in Morgan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.037" offset="13065206">New York in the Morgan case argued that its English language requirement could not be prohibited by Congress because the Constitution did not require it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.596" offset="13107420">And that's exactly... and the significance of Morgan is that it gives Congress the authority to go beyond when all that Congress is doing is to identify means of enforcing those constitutional rights that have been already identified by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.605" offset="13171472">With regard to EEOC and... this is one instance, Justice Rehnquist, in which I guessed right as to what EEOC would do... there are opinions, apparently, in both the Department of Labor and EEOC that more frequent physical examinations for older employees is not violative of the ADEA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.034" offset="13253183">With regard to the question of whether Congress has, in effect, concluded that there is a BFOQ for law enforcement, that is not the approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.703" offset="13291844">And indeed, if it were it would excuse privately employed security guards covered by the ADEA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.683" offset="13323714">Rather, Congress's approach has simply been to go not as far as it might.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.758" offset="13352030">With regard to the states, it has not prohibited age discrimination under age 40 or over age 70, and with regard to the federal government, it has not yet applied to all federal employees.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="3314.503" offset="13399051">Well, there are a number of federal employees who are not subject to as stringent limitations on retirement as the state of Wyoming's will be, isn't that true?</text>

            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="3322.999" offset="13433010">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.453" offset="13434786">As I say, it is an under-inclusiveness argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.546" offset="13443250">Finally, let me take Justice Stevens' question one step further.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.231" offset="13457983">Congress reenacts and says that it's acting pursuant to the 14th Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.074" offset="13477314">The same result obtains, I submit, if Congress reenacts and says absolutely nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.414" offset="13506675">There is no constitutional requirement that Congress either provide legislative history or specify the constitutional basis for what it has done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.316" offset="13542306">In this case, the determinative fact is that there is a constitutional basis, and Congress exercised that constitutional basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.423" offset="13570728">Whether it was smart enough to know that that is what it was doing or not is for this Court to determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.953" offset="13596850">For this reason, the Judgment of the District Court of the Wyoming should be reversed.</text>
