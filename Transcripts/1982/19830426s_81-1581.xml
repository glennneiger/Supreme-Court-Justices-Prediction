            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="7.308" offset="121444">This case comes to us by way of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.690" offset="151014">The petitioners are members of a "Program Committee" for the Hawaii State Prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.893" offset="175778">They investigated a breakdown in discipline within the maximum controlled unit and singled out the respondent another inmate as troublemakers.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.656" offset="218828">After a hearing at which the respondent retained counsel to represent him, the Committee recommended that he be continued to be classified as a maximum security risk and that he be transferred to a prison in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.242" offset="285179">The administrator of the Hawaii prison accepted the Committee's recommendation and the transfer was effectuated.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.586" offset="314541">The respondent then filed this suit in federal court alleging that he had been denied procedural due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.558" offset="346515">The Federal District Court dismissed the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.821" offset="355501">It held that the applicable Hawaii regulations governing prison transfers did not create a substantive liberty interest that was protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.436" offset="414015">The Court of Appeals however reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.116" offset="424673">In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we in turn reverse the judgment of the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.725" offset="451109">An interstate prison transfer does not deprive an inmate of any liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause in and of itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.203" offset="489039">The inmate has no justifiable expectation that he will be incarcerated in any particular prison within a state.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.687" offset="522998">And he also has no justifiable expectation that he will be incarcerated in a particular state.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.204" offset="549016">Statutes and interstate agreements recognize that it is often necessary to transfer inmates to prisons in other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.290" offset="581408">Confinement in another state is within the normal limits or range of custody which the conviction has authorized the transferring state to impose.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.164" offset="620905">And this is so even though the transfer as in this case involves a long distance and an ocean crossing.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.405" offset="653819">And thus the confinement remains within constitutional limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.659" offset="670851">We also hold that Hawaii's prison regulations do not create a constitutionally protected liberty interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.501" offset="702198">Those regulations place no substantive limitations on the prison administrator's discretion to transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.837" offset="735635">Justice Marshall has filed a dissenting opinion and is joined therein by Justice Brennan and Justice Stevens joins Part I of Justice Marshall's dissenting opinion.</text>
