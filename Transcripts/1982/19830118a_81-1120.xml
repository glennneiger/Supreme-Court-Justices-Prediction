            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="127.822" offset="663136">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="130.602" offset="674211">This case is here on the Government's petition from the Court of Appeals' reversal of a judgment holding the respondent in civil contempt for noncompliance with an order enforcing Internal Revenue summonses.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.718" offset="758639">A motion to expand the issues beyond those raised in the Government's petition was denied by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.576" offset="790091">Briefly, what occurred here was a summons was issued as part of an investigation of respondent's tax liabilities for the years 1973 through '77.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.986" offset="883714">The summons called upon him as president of two real estate corporations to produce the books and records of those corporations, as well as to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.387" offset="937317">When he failed to comply, the usual petition for enforcement of the summons was filed within a... a supporting affidavit by the Internal Revenue agent, and a show cause order was issued for the summons enforcement proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.456" offset="1041598">There were some evasions of efforts to serve the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.373" offset="1069287">Those are for the most part more relative to the criminal contempt proceeding rather than the civil contempt proceeding now before the Court, although they could have a bearing on the respondent's credibility when he did appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.617" offset="1146296">Eventually he was served and directed to appear at an enforcement hearing held about one year after the summons had been issued, and he was also asked to respond, to put into issue any issues that might be controverted.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.952" offset="1239606">He neither appeared nor filed a response, nor did anyone else appear on behalf of the corporation, although he did prior to the hearing send a letter to the Deputy United States Marshall and to the Court in which he claimed he was not the president of the corporations and had been improperly served.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.752" offset="1350783">Because the Government therefore anticipated that he might put that issue into contest into the summons enforcement proceeding, it did come prepared to make proof that the corporations had been duly chartered with him as a director and had not been dissolved and that he had acted in banking and business transactions on behalf of the corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.599" offset="1470215">This offer of proof was made in his absence, and an enforcement order was issued, and he was ordered to comply.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.203" offset="1520579">And when he failed to produce the records upon meeting with the agent in pursuit of that, and after other difficulties in serving him again, eventually a show cause order for the contempt proceeding was served upon him after his arrest pursuant to a bench warrant; and the hearing was held some months later with the respondent in attendance.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.421" offset="1657460">And at that time he again did not testify or present any evidence, was... the Government attempted to further bolster its case with some additional evidence, but that proved to be unsuccessful because the witnesses in one case pleaded the Fifth Amendment, in the other case had nothing of value to state.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.567" offset="1778042">And the District Court held the respondent in contempt and then gave him an opportunity to purge himself, whereupon he offered a written statement entitled "Oath in Purgation of Contempt", but refused to testify or to be cross examined on the statement and did not produce any other evidence in response to the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.787" offset="1931015">And the District Court found that he as president of the corporations had possession or control of the records and had not satisfied his burden to show that he could not comply with the summonses and failed to produce any evidence of the contempt proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.546" offset="2001963">Now, while our position gained some strength from the belated nature of the respondent's submission of this oath in purgation, as I will explain for purposes of the civil contempt, our basic position would be the same if he had made precisely the same submission at the outset of the summons enforcement hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.625" offset="2134352">This Court has considered the showing that the Government is required to make in an Internal Revenue summons enforcement proceeding on a number of occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.761" offset="2182835">The basic case, United States v. Powell, is of course cited in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.836" offset="2207181">And if those cases mean anything they mean that when the Government made that showing, it is entitled to have its summons enforced unless... and the question in this case is what does that "unless" mean in the context of a summons seeking production of corporate records from an officer who would ordinarily be their custodian, have either possession or control over them.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.649" offset="2358378">And in answering the question of what the "unless" means, we look to, and we think it's proper for the Court to look to, cases involving not only Internal Revenue summons but other forms of legal process such as grand jury subpoenas, congressional subpoenas, proceedings to direct a bankrupt to turn over his records to a trustee, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.573" offset="2462136">Because the issue is basically the same, and the principle that we draw from the case law is that when the Government has made its requisite showing, it has established a prima facie case that it's entitled to enforcement, that the order should be complied with, and that a burden of production then shifts to the respondent to introduce some evidence of why he should not comply.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.544" offset="2629947">The burden of persuasion does not shift, but a burden of production shifts at that point because the Government is not required to anticipate and negate every possible defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.316" offset="2701105">This is... this principle is explained perhaps most explicitly in an excerpt that we reproduce on page 24 of our brief from this Court's opinion in United States v. Fleischman, which happened to be a criminal contempt proceeding involving a congressional subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.104" offset="2796190">But it explains that the rule being adopted is a rule affecting merely the time and manner of proof rather than a shift of the burden of persuasion, but it explains that the prosecution would be under a serious practical handicap if it must negate all possible defenses, and that the... the relevant facts are peculiarly within the respondent's knowledge of why, contrary to what one would normally think of the president of a corporation, he is not in a position to comply with the subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.993" offset="2963792">There is sort of a presumption of business regularity, that the person normally thought to be in possession or control of a business' records would be the person to seek them from.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.643" offset="3022411">This is the way grand jury subpoenas are issued, and there's never any further showing than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.077" offset="3048115">Then it's up to that officer to say why it is that he can't comply.</text>

            <text syncTime="1662.705" offset="6802643">Mr. Chief Justice Burger, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.282" offset="6812987">What this case is really all about is whether or not my client, Mr. Rylander, met his burden of production on his defense of inability to comply by several things, not just his oath and affirmation that he didn't have the documents, but when he showed up in front of the IRS on February 4th and said I don't have them and I take the Fifth, when the agents testified on the trial on October 8th that he had said that, when he filed the oath, and finally, in answer to Justice Stevens' question, when he took the stand on October 23rd and Federal Judge Carlton said to him,</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.689" offset="6966587">"Mr. Carl... Mr. Rylander, you have filed an oath in purgation stating that you do not have the records. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.843" offset="6987171">He said,</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.249" offset="6988843">"That is correct, Your Honor. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.469" offset="6993650">Judge Carlton said to him, "Where are the records"?</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.887" offset="7003367">And he said,</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.359" offset="7005248">"I take the Fifth on the advice of my counsel. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.968" offset="7015697">As the Court is aware from the record, I was appointed to represent him on October 9th, the day after the trial, a combined trial, civil and criminal contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.446" offset="7057598">The first thing I did immediately was have the civil contempt vacated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.584" offset="7074107">We then proceeded to adduce more evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.240" offset="7084765">So it's not just his oath that's in evidence to support his burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.522" offset="7097931">But the issue here is is the oath... and I say along with his other testimony, including that on the stand and that in front of the IRS agent... sufficient to meet his burden of production at a contempt hearing to prove his inability sufficient to put the burden of production again back to the Government along with their burden of persuasion, which they had all along, by clear and convincing evidence to prove that the records that they sought ever existed, which they never showed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.242" offset="7212765">If we return to the summons enforcement hearing, which this Court has said in Donaldson must be summary in nature, and this Court said in Powell you must meet only these minimum conditions, and in Freedom Church said that the issue of his possession, the person summoned, is never in issue was met.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.560" offset="7290087">Their... their offer of proof there was... and you have to remember this is 1979 now... excuse me... 1980... that he was president of a corporation in 1975, that he signed two checks in 1975, that he was president of the other corporation in 1975, and that he signed two checks in 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.942" offset="7375560">As the Court should be aware from the trial on October 8th, the Government introduced two affidavits from the Secretary of State of California that both of those corporations weren't active.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.267" offset="7416834">One died in 1975, and the other one had been active in '74, '76 and '78.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.702" offset="7442643">So the Government at the summons enforcement hearing never had the burden to show that those records existed, never tendered the issue that those records existed, and never proved that those records existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.619" offset="7486319">At the contempt trial for the first time Mr. Rylander said,</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.945" offset="7503560">"The reason I can't produce them is I don't have them. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.553" offset="7514009">And when asked why don't you have them, he properly, under McPhaul, Curcio, O'Henry, Meeks, Traub, Hansen Niederhauser and every other case we've cited in our brief, said,</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.472" offset="7557686">"I can't tell you that. "</text>

            <text syncTime="3504.449" offset="14169591">"The defendant as president or other corporate officer had possession or control or both of the books and records of said corporation. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.536" offset="14209924">And this is based partly on this inference from the circumstances, but also on page 54 of the Joint Appendix there is testimony by an Internal Revenue agent who interviewed Mr. Rylander in 1975, that he indicated that at that time the records were in existence, and that they were at Apex Bookkeeping, and an address was given by this agent testifying about what Mr. Rylander said in the interview at that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="3602.407" offset="14561428">That's his choice of voluntarily taking the stand, although he didn't legitimately do it because he refused to submit to cross examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.326" offset="14597163">But the court on pages 57 and 58 of the Joint Appendix, the District Court made it quite clear that he could purge himself of the contempt by... merely by indicating his willingness to comply with the court's order relating to the production of the documents, unlike Curcio's situation where he was called to the stand, and the contempt was in failing to answer questions propounded to him.</text>
