            <text syncTime="34.951" offset="291495">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.294" offset="292958">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="36.811" offset="299018">This case presents an important question under the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act that will have a profound effect on the public health.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.961" offset="331619">The Court of Appeals' decision permits the sale without FDA approval of a large category of prescription medicines known as generic drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.410" offset="369340">Such products purport to be interchangeable with preexisting or pioneer drugs for treating serious and life-threatening diseases, but they are not identical to the pioneers and they may in fact be unsafe and ineffective.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.360" offset="429212">By way of background, I should explain that drugs are composed active ingredients, which are intended to have a therapeutic effect on the patient, and inactive ingredients, which are not intended to have a therapeutic effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.743" offset="482711">The inactive ingredients, however, play an important role.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.491" offset="497653">They may comprise 90 to 99 percent of a product and they often have a significant impact on how the active ingredient does its job.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.396" offset="537359">For example, the inactive ingredients influence how much active ingredient reaches the bloodstream and how quickly this occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.265" offset="568811">So even if two drugs have the same active ingredient, we cannot assume that they will have the same results.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.015" offset="595769">The inactive ingredients may slow down or block the action of the active ingredient altogether, so it's as if the patient took no medication at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.806" offset="634953">For a patient who's taking a drug to control high blood pressure, such as most of the drugs involved in this case were, this means he runs the risk of heart attach or stroke.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.129" offset="676226">On the other hand, the inactive ingredients can speed up or increase the effect of the active ingredient, and this is perhaps most apparent in time release drugs, where the result can be a dumping of active ingredients too quickly into the bloodstream, causing toxicity, overdose and other adverse side effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.217" offset="752608">It's as if in that case the patient has taken two or three or ten times the appropriate dosage.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.276" offset="776850">By the same token, different manufacturing methods can also affect how the drug works.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.931" offset="799420">If the drug is packed too densely or too loosely into the tablet, the patient may suffer from wholly unintended reactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.726" offset="830662">These differences are vitally important for generic drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.240" offset="844664">These drugs are offered as substitutes for preexisting products whose effects and proper dosages are well known.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.689" offset="878519">But unless the generic actually performs the same way the pioneer does, the substitution may be dangerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.075" offset="908089">Because the generic company does not know the full composition or manufacturing methods of the pioneer, the only way to be assured that the copy and the pioneer will in fact work the same way is by testing one against the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.053" offset="967962">If they perform in a similar way, they are considered to be bioequivalent and substitution will not affect the patient.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.521" offset="997846">But if they do not work the same way, then substitution poses a real danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.082" offset="1020102">In this case, the district court found that the products Respondent sold were not tested and were not generally recognized by experts as safe and effective for their intended uses, and that was all the Government needed to show for Respondents to be enjoined.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.884" offset="1087289">But the Eleventh Circuit held that these untested drugs could be sold with no scrutiny whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.194" offset="1112471">The court wrongly concluded that the Act's use of the term "drug" refers only to active ingredients and not to the real life drugs that doctors prescribe, pharmacists dispense, and patients ingest, that is drugs as products.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.688" offset="1182479">As a result, the court has discarded the carefully crafted statutory scheme that assures that all drugs available for consumption by the public are in advance determined by experts to be safe and effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.573" offset="1238068">And this holding creates a mammoth exception that would allow untested prescription drugs to reach the public simply because a manufacturer wants to sell them.</text>

            <text syncTime="882.555" offset="3681980">It is consistent in the sense that, first of all, it provided notice to the FDA that a drug was proposed to be marketed, and such notice is not going to take place under the Court of Appeals' decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.786" offset="3738927">Second, it was clear that the FDA, even in issuing these advisory opinions, was looking at products because on occasion it rejected the sale of so-called generic products that were copies of the active ingredients of products already on the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.418" offset="3821369">And third, that practice, which as I said was terminated in 1968 when all the "not new drug" letters were revoked, was in place at a time when the burgeoning generic drug industry was significantly smaller than it is today.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.205" offset="3888556">Through the 1960's most of the states had anti-substitution laws, so that if a brand name drug was prescribed it had to be dispensed.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.048" offset="3927949">You could not substitute a generic.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.953" offset="3939547">Around the end of the 1960's and into the 1970's, the states had shifted their position, in large part because the 1962 amendments to the Act that we're concerned with here called for effectiveness to be demonstrated before a drug could be sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.177" offset="4016452">And in reliance on that, in reliance on the fact that the Food and Drug Administration was going to be reviewing in advance products that were going to be on the market, the states have moved to the current regime of drug substitution where generics can be substituted when the brand name has been indicated but the doctor allows substitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.559" offset="4109970">And that points up one of the major problems in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.840" offset="4119061">Unless the generics are subject to FDA scrutiny, the doctor is not going to know what product his patient is actually getting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.960" offset="4155632">He's not going to know how the inactive ingredients may differ, he's not going to know how the manufacturing methods may differ.</text>

            <text syncTime="1242.145" offset="5120282">As I recall, the evidence in terms of those regulations is that it may take approximately two years for an application to be approved from the time it is submitted and filed with the FDA to the time that it is approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.012" offset="5183812">But the active regulation as a new drug would continue thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.247" offset="5200739">Now, the portion of the statutory definition of the word (B), is something that the Court of Appeals ignored altogether, and its finding that only the active ingredients are covered finds no support in the statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.548" offset="5281928">The Court of Appeals' error is even clearer when viewed in the full context of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.625" offset="5302199">Congress passed this Act in 1938 in the wake of the Elixir Sulfanilamide tragedy, in which more than 100 people were killed by an unsafe inactive ingredient in a drug that had the same active ingredient as another product that had been used safely for years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.417" offset="5369385">The Act was passed to ensure that such incidents never be repeated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.322" offset="5389030">The Congress went about this task with great care.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.600" offset="5406166">It established a statutory scheme that we've discussed in some detail already.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.488" offset="5421735">Under this scheme all drugs would be subject to expert scrutiny before they could be sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.141" offset="5444305">And the cornerstone of this legislation is the NDA process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.813" offset="5463008">Now, I should add that in the statute Congress specifically identified the information that was to be supplied in an NDA, and that included, in addition to evidence of testing to establish a drug's safety, all the ingredients in the drug must be listed and the precise methods of manufacture supplied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.945" offset="5539495">So it's clear that from the very start Congress expressed its concern for inactive ingredients and manufacturing methods, as well it should have after the Elixir Sulfanilamide situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.487" offset="5585679">Now, Congress amended the Act in 1962 following the Thalidomide tragedy in Europe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.189" offset="5612533">At that time it expressed its approval of FDA's efforts in keeping Thalidomide off the market, and it expanded the Act's protection of the public by adding the standard of drug effectiveness, so that now a manufacturer must demonstrate by substantial evidence that its product is both safe and effective for its intended use before it can be sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.915" offset="5699364">And there was no indication in 1962, or 1938 for that matter, of any Congressional intent to weaken FDA's power to keep unapproved drugs off the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.801" offset="5742936">Aside from the preclearance program, the Act also provides other means for ensuring that drugs, once on the market, perform as they are supposed to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.860" offset="5779194">While these misbranding and adulteration provisions are important enforcement tools, they address only products already being sold and are not a substitute for premarket review, nor were they intended to be such a substitute, as again the Elixir Sulfanilamide history shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.245" offset="5848680">That drug was in fact seized as misbranded, but the experience led Congress to conclude that such after the fact remedies alone were not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.630" offset="5898208">Now, in totally exempting the generic drugs from the NDA process the Court of Appeals said that they may be sold even though they're not tested, as was the case with the drugs in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.780" offset="5954842">And under the decision below, because there will not be an approved NDA for these products, they are also exempt from other safeguards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.868" offset="5987234">Among these is the requirement I mentioned before, that the NDA holder report subsequent evidence of adverse reactions under Section 355(j).</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.630" offset="6022238">When circumstances warrant, the agency may withdraw its approval and in that event the drug may no longer be sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.536" offset="6049928">This exemption that the Court of Appeals created was unintended by Congress, and in reaching the conclusion it did the Court of Appeals acted in a manner that was contrary to the way this Court has consistently interpreted the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.744" offset="6118682">Dotterweich, Bacto-Unidisk, Rutherford, Hynson, and the Park case in 1975 teach us that the Act is to be read broadly and its exceptions narrowly, in order to give full effect to Congress' effort to protect the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.866" offset="6183256">I mentioned also the FDA experience of 40 years, the question I had before as to whether we've changed our mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.221" offset="6228605">We explained in our brief why on the critical issue in this case we haven't changed our mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.106" offset="6248145">If Respondents contention is right that there has been some agency vacillation, what we are doing now is returning to where we were in 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.462" offset="6285552">We are not coming up with something new.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.665" offset="6294434">And we are recognizing that the Congressional intent to incorporate ongoing medical and scientific research, which today leaves no doubt and is undisputed that differences in inactive ingredients and manufacturing methods often can cause differences in the way the products react... taking all of this into consideration, the fact is that we're consistent on the main issue, and if in fact we've changed our mind, then as this Court said in the 1978 NLRB versus Iron Workers case, the agency is certainly entitled to change its mind and its interpretation should still stand so long as it's a defensible interpretation of the statute, as this one certainly is.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robyn Greene</label>
            <text syncTime="1794.230" offset="7328674">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.337" offset="7341108">This case does not involve the issue of whether premarket approval of generic products would make those products safer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.948" offset="7367544">The issue is whether generic drug products, both prescription and nonprescription, which contain active ingredients which are generally recognized as safe and effective are new drugs requiring premarket clearance from the FDA before they're sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.095" offset="7424073">The issue of prescription-nonprescription drugs is very important here, and it wasn't until this case got into this Court that the Government suddenly took the position that only prescription drugs were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.965" offset="7471616">In the complaint which was filed against my client, the Government sought to enjoin the distribution of all unapproved drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.807" offset="7502963">When the case was argued in front of the Court of Appeals, the issue of over the counter drugs was raised and discussed before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.900" offset="7531384">It was only when the Government filed its petition in this case that it suddenly claimed that the issue was only prescription drugs, and it was joined by amicus curiae, The Proprietary Association, which represents the various groups which make over the counter products.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.674" offset="7590421">The Government's reason for trying to narrow this case is obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.686" offset="7610483">As this Court has recognized in its prior decisions, there are in excess of half a million over the counter products currently on the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.793" offset="7642874">It is simply impossible for the FDA to approve new drug applications for every over the counter drug, and in fact FDA does not require over the counter products to have new drug approvals, although the statute in question does not distinguish between over the counter and prescription drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.457" offset="7725526">In this case both the language of the statute and the very, very clear legislative history show conclusively that Congress has never intended that each and every prescription and nonprescription drug product obtain premarket approval from the FDA before it is sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.731" offset="7786652">Congress has rejected licensing of products on at least three separate occasions, beginning in the 1930's.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.980" offset="7815701">The original Food and Drug Act was passed in 1906 and during the early 1930's Congress began to re-examine it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.163" offset="7844435">Very few of the early drafts of bills before Congress contained any language about premarket clearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.849" offset="7875155">However, there was one such bill and that was submitted by Representative Coffee, who seemed to be kind of a Ralph Nader of his time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.499" offset="7909741">He was a very liberal man.</text>

            <text syncTime="1943.046" offset="7923952">He believed it was in the interest of consumers to have product by product licensing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.529" offset="7945895">And his bill specifically provided... he used very specific language... each product must get a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.556" offset="7974003">Congress didn't want to hear from Representative Coffee at that time and his bill died.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.258" offset="7996781">The Elixir Sulfanilamide incident occurred, and at that point there was a great hue and cry to have some form of premarket clearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.752" offset="8026770">The Government has argued in this case that simply because premarket clearance came after the Elixir Sulfanilamide incident, that therefore the premarket clearance that was passed must have been product by product licensing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.998" offset="8079746">It's a non sequitur and it's simply belied by the legislative history, which we cited extensively in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.573" offset="8106078">Representative Coffee and other people got up repeatedly in the legislative history and said, the bill that we have before us that is going to be passed is not a product licensing provision, we are rejecting product licensing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.116" offset="8160203">And it's just clear that the type of bill that Representative Coffee wanted, product by product licensing, was decisively rejected by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.689" offset="8202522">The Government has claimed that we have cited snippets of the legislative history in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.906" offset="8223315">We have devoted at least five full pages to going through portions of the Congressional Record, and it is much more than a snippet that we rely on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.027" offset="8259887">The second time the issue came up in front of Congress was in the 1960's.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.977" offset="8283606">In the 1960's Senator Kefauver wanted product by product licensing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.320" offset="8305026">He submitted a bill which provided</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.910" offset="8331358">"that there would be licenses for the maintenance of establishments for the propagation or manufacture or preparation of products described in subsection (a) of this section. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.860" offset="8375139">And the products for which a license is desired must meet standards designed to ensure the continued chemical structure, strength, quality, purity, safety and efficacy of such products.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.620" offset="8422264">Senator Kefauver presented this bill to Congress and it eventually passed, but in a much modified form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.462" offset="8453611">The factory licensing provisions which were contained in the bill originally remained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.224" offset="8472628">The product licensing provisions were taken out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.205" offset="8488510">And this was in the 1960's.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.424" offset="8505438">Now, the Court I think is correct in saying that the FDA's position has been anything but consistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.142" offset="8536262">For at least 30 years it said that what my client was doing, namely selling unapproved generics, which they are not doing any more, as we have pointed out in our suggestion of mootness... they took the position that it was perfectly proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.306" offset="8596971">And when the FDA last came to this Court in a case involving a similar issue involving generic drugs in the 1970's, it argued before this Court that when it withdrew an approval, a new drug approval for a pioneer drug, that that would automatically require that all unapproved generic drugs be removed from the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.280" offset="8696863">In the 1970's, this Court recognized in the Hynson decision and other decisions that all of the generics it was talking about had never received approval from the FDA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.588" offset="8738136">It's stated in the opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.055" offset="8743988">The Government never argued that these products were not legally on the market because they did not have new drug approvals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.539" offset="8773872">Instead, it argued that the withdrawal of the new drug approval for the pioneer automatically resulted in a determination that the generics could not be sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.032" offset="8815877">So the FDA's position that it has been consistent is simply incorrect, and the FDA's actual change in position came about some time in the mid-70's.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.749" offset="8866763">After the FDA had changed its position approximately in the mid-1970's, the Third Circuit decided the first of the cases which involves the issue here, the Lannett case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2448.867" offset="9947188">Well, I think what Congress was rejecting was the idea that each and every product had to go for an NDA, because after the product gets on the market in terms of an NDA 99 percent of all products, both in the 1930's and today, are patented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.488" offset="10013643">The company which has the original patent is permitted to put the product on the market for a period of 17 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.815" offset="10043005">It may issue licenses to several other manufacturers to distribute that product, but the product stays on the market for 17 years in more or less of a monopoly situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.637" offset="10082293">At the end of 17 years when the patent expires, other companies then are free to come in and duplicate the product.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.181" offset="10108416">After the 17 years some products, some active ingredients that have been sold, are then generally recognized as safe and effective and can be sold without premarket clearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.022" offset="10151779">Other products, for example a product like Oraflex, which was on the market for a year, even though it had FDA approval certainly no one would recognize it as being particularly safe today, and in fact it has been taken off the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.452" offset="10205591">So the 17-year patent period is a period of time during which the community of experts can formulate opinions about whether the active ingredient that is being sold is generally recognized as safe and effective.</text>

            <text syncTime="2532.258" offset="10280824">The bioavailability and bioequivalence concerns that the Government raises were dealt with by Congress very specifically in the statute that exists through the adulteration requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.379" offset="10329307">It is... under the Act as it has existed since the 1930's, a manufacturer is not allowed to sell a product if its strength, quality or purity falls below compendial standards as recognized in the United States Pharmacopoeia or the National Formulary, both of which are expressly mentioned as guidelines in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.806" offset="10422930">If one opens the United States Pharmacopoeia and the National Formulary, one finds mainly definitions of drug substances, and the drug substances are listed and underneath it will give the percentage of the active ingredient that should be found in the product that is sold, and there are disintegration requirements.</text>

            <text syncTime="2811.893" offset="11399283">Well, I think... but the statute still uses the word "article", and the Government has claimed that "article" should be used in its broad generic sense and not in any way related to its use in the Pharmacopoeia and the Formulary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.637" offset="11458319">If in fact "article" means items in the Pharmacopoeia or the Formulary, it should mean the same thing all the way through the statute, and it shouldn't be changed in that part of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.929" offset="11503459">There are various items recognized in the Pharmacopoeia which are combinations of active ingredients and are specifically listed as combinations in the Pharmacopoeia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.644" offset="11558316">I think that at a minimum the Government has tried to take the position partially that the statute is unambiguous and that this Court should not look at the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.060" offset="11600008">It's our position in our brief that the statute at best is ambiguous and that any ambiguities in terms of the word "articles" should be resolved by reference to the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.744" offset="11650685">I think in resolving the issue of what the word "articles" means, one useful thing that I did, I went through the entire statute and I looked at the word "drug", and every time it said "drug" I substituted "active ingredient" versus "product" in order to determine which interpretation made more sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.626" offset="11746293">90 percent of the time it didn't make any difference at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.482" offset="11761653">But in a couple of situations it did make a very large difference, and if I can just find the one place where it was absolutely most erratic, Section 502(i) of the Act says:</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.835" offset="11831034">"A drug or device shall be deemed to be misbranded if it is an imitation of another drug. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.521" offset="11853813">Now, if we take the word "product", which is what the Government says "drug" means, and substitute it into the Act, that portion of the Act would then mean a product shall be deemed to be misbranded if it is an imitation of another product.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.859" offset="11911178">Well, of course all generic drugs are imitations of other drugs, and if you use the word "product" in this part of the Act it would effectively outlaw the entire generic drug industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.650" offset="11954332">And by substituting in other parts of the statute it's clear that Congress could not have intended the word "drug" to be "product", but rather it meant the active ingredient or combination of active ingredients in the product.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.566" offset="12010025">And I think again and again in going through the legislative history, Congress has stated that it is relying on the adulteration provisions and adherence to compendial standards to bring... I'm sorry.</text>

            <text syncTime="3632.243" offset="14680680">Now, the suggestion that we had from them is that the named Respondents would be willing to agree to an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.773" offset="14710878">What we asked for was something that would be broader than that, and we indicated in our brief in response to the suggestion of mootness that one of the problems it that they have shrouded the corporate relationships of the company in some mystery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.628" offset="14766257">Now, they continue to do so to this date, despite Rule 28.1 of this Court.</text>
