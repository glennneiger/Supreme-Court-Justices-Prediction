            <label>Mr. Donald F. Sileo</label>
            <text syncTime="77.416" offset="457341">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.035" offset="467790">This case is about two union officers, David Lang and Eugene Light, who participated in an unlawful strike at Three Mile Island on August 30, 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.010" offset="519722">The immediately apparent issue is whether petitioner was justified in relying upon two prior arbitration decisions between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.150" offset="568309">Those arbitration decisions imposed upon union officers greater duties than those imposed upon rank-and-file employees; namely, not only not to participate in the strike but to urge others from participating in the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.195" offset="636437">For breach of those duties the union officers could be disciplined more severely than the rank-and-file employees, according to the arbitration decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.718" offset="674576">Here Lang and Light received 25 days' suspensions from employment and the others up to 10 days' suspension from employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.241" offset="704669">I describe that issue as the immediately apparent one because there are two fundamental, far-reaching issues under federal labor law as to the impact of this case generally throughout this country on the no-strike promises in various contracts, and virtually all contracts, as a matter of fact, and on the vitality of arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.824" offset="815010">First of all, should the National Labor Relations Board be allowed to marshal all its weaponry in blatant interference with the collective bargaining process, thereby relieving the union of the full scope of its no-strike clause obligation?</text>
            <text syncTime="187.721" offset="898602">If the Labor Board is successful in this, it will eviscerate what little is left of what has already been called the largely chimerical and illusory remedies that are available to an employer for violation of a no-strike clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.099" offset="964117">That no-strike promise, as this Court well knows, is the most important promise that a union makes to the employer, particularly important, I might add, to this public utility employer, that not only operates a nuclear site but has 24 hours a day continuous service in all its operations, as is noted and acknowledged in several different places in the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.516" offset="1077802">The second vital long-range issue involved in this case is whether the National Labor Relations Board should be allowed to dangerously erode this Court's Steelworkers Trilogy cases or whether that foundation of industrial peace will remain unshaken.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.080" offset="1155960">This case has generated widespread interest throughout the entire country.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="257.151" stopTime="264.222">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="257.151" offset="1176336">Well, Mr. Sileo, in your petition you raise a second question that I take is independent of the arbitration problem.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="donald_f_sileo" startTime="264.222" stopTime="514.885">
            <label>Mr. Donald F. Sileo</label>
            <text syncTime="264.222" offset="1204548">That is correct, Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.839" offset="1211026">And that second issue is whether independent of arbitration there is a higher duty on rank-and-file employees irrespective of whether there have been arbitration decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.147" offset="1260241">Justice Rehnquist, I recognize this Court's disinclination to make decisions on the broadest possible basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.068" offset="1287931">We think that our case is very strong on the point you raised as well as on the arbitration point.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.657" offset="1318337">We have concentrated on the arbitration point because we think we have the very strongest case in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.811" offset="1342892">But we certainly are not running away from the operation of law argument which we raise in our briefs and which the amici raise in their briefs; namely, that there is a duty arising out of their positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.702" offset="1390540">And certainly there have been three members of the Labor Board in recent years that have adhered to that position, and there is a body of arbitral authority that adheres to that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.324" offset="1432962">But if I may return to the thrust of the arbitration argument, the brief background with respect to this case is that in September 1980 the National Labor Relations Board handed down its decision, which was consistent with the per se Precision Castings rule, which was short-lived namely, that disciplining union officers more severely than rank-and-file employees was in and of itself discriminatory, a violation, and they treated as irrelevant the arbitration decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.231" offset="1564620">In November of 1981 the Third Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the per se approach of Precision Castings, but nevertheless found against petitioner, holding that in order for there to be a greater duty it must be in the precise language, those greater duties for the union officers must be in the precise language of the collective bargaining agreement document itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.395" offset="1653227">And the Third Circuit discounted the arbitration decisions that petitioner had relied upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.965" offset="1679558">There have been some recent cases in this area of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.417" offset="1693351">One of them handed down by the National Labor Relations Board was Consolidation Coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.654" offset="1710278">There were five Board members, at that time anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.606" offset="1722086">There are four now; there will be two new appointments within a few months.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.141" offset="1736296">This whole area is in a state of flux as far as the Labor Board is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.693" offset="1750507">Those five Board members handed down four opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.795" offset="1762837">Those opinions, I think, are fairly summarized in the Board's brief at pages 32 and 33, footnote 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.068" offset="1791989">In effect, the Labor Board decision... a majority of the members at least... abandon the per se Precision Castings approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.257" offset="1824695">Recently, in the Fifth Circuit a court in South Central Bell agreed with the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in Metropolitan Edison.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.129" offset="1868162">Contrarywise, in February of 1982 the Circuit Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia in the Fournelle case, written by Judge Harry T. Edwards, who has labor expertise and recognition throughout the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.289" offset="1928871">In that decision Judge Edwards found that where under similar circumstances to these there had been a prior arbitration decision, that prior arbitration decision had imposed greater duties upon union officers than rank-and-file employees, the kinds of duties that we have in this case here, those kinds of greater duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.703" offset="2006507">Under those circumstances, the Circuit Court, District of Columbia, found that the union officers might be disciplined more severely and found further that when a subsequent case arose in this general area... namely, involving union officers being disciplined more severely during an unlawful strike... we had a contractual claim case.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.751" offset="2102742">We no longer had an unfair labor practice case.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.603" offset="2114131">We had, in the words of the court, the Labor Board</text>
            <text syncTime="495.924" offset="2131372">"meddling in the legitimate products of the collective bargaining process. "</text>
            <text syncTime="501.559" offset="2153942">Judge Edwards relied very heavily upon this Court's Steelworkers Trilogy cases, and particularly the Warrior case where this Court said that arbitration is part and parcel of the collective bargaining process, where this Court said--</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald F. Sileo</label>
            <text syncTime="546.523" offset="2333769">We think not at all, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.423" offset="2337426">We think that a case of this magnitude certainly should not turn on a phrase for the term of the agreement which appears as surplusage throughout the agreement in a number of different provisions, 7.8, 7.9, 7.10, 1.5, the very recognition clause that wherein the Metropolitan Edison recognizes the union and agrees that it will not... that it will not bargain with any other union during... at the conclusion of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.424" offset="2445364">We think that it is just surplusage.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.142" offset="2456231">We think further that the union has in effect conceded that because in the second arbitration decision... namely, the Seidenberg decision... there was no challenge to the first arbitration decision on that basis, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.968" offset="2519552">In the Alderfer decision about which we wrote... namely, that decision in which the arbitrator had said that a refusal to cross a picket line was a violation of the contract... in that decision there was a subsequent challenge, I should say, before the National Labor Relations Board, there was a stipulation that a refusal to cross the picket line, as in this case, represented an unlawful strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.373" offset="2645149">That is contrary to Board law, as a matter of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.991" offset="2663643">There is U.S. Steel and cases that have been cited in the Board's brief to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.710" offset="2678481">And yet the union recognized that refusal to cross a picket line in the context of these parties was a violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.981" offset="2719650">Surely, the reason why it recognized it is because of the Aldefer award back in 1972... early '73, I should say.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.421" offset="2749325">And it is our contention that that makes very clear that the union recognized all of these decisions as having a continuing effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.575" offset="2777955">All that... all of the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement were for the term of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.145" offset="2804287">This was simply repeating that which was part and parcel of the agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="739.312" offset="3104904">There was a contractual violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.562" offset="3109919">And in making that determination, he took into account, we contend, 11.1, the no-strike clause; 12.2, the responsibility of the International; 9.4 the additional rights that union officers have under the contract; the continuous service provisions, 2.7, 6.4(a) and 6.3(a); all those continuous service provisions which underline how important it was for this employer to have such continuous service.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.331" offset="3224962">And yes, the industrial common law, as this Court said in the Steelworkers Trilogy, in Warrior, industrial common law certainly is something to be looked at.</text>

            <text syncTime="835.874" offset="3491202">Well, of course, that's... our point is that this is a contractual claim case and not a statutory right case.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.927" offset="3507398">Our claim is that in order to have a statutory right case, you have to have disparate discipline, and this is not disparate discipline... I mean you have to have disparate discipline of like cases, of individuals similarly situated.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.651" offset="3562256">We don't have similarly situated individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.020" offset="3571764">The contract was interpreted by the arbitrators as making very clear that we did not... we do not have similarly situated individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.393" offset="3605305">Returning to the analysis of the Fournelle decision, I think I have finished.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.815" offset="3642922">There was a follow-up to the Fournelle decision, a case which I shall mispronounce as Szewczuga.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.219" offset="3664551">But it involved Miller Brewing, in any event, which is easier to pronounce.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.254" offset="3676672">In that case the Court in no way, the Circuit Court, District of Columbia, in no way departed from the Fournelle holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.408" offset="3705302">And as a matter of fact, there was no arbitration decision introduced in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.745" offset="3722647">And the Circuit Court, District of Columbia, in that case clearly demarcated its difference from the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.668" offset="3754308">In this case this Court, consistent with its teachings, can promote the national labor policy of industrial... of encouraging industrial peace through the collective bargaining process, including arbitration, and it can do so without infringing upon the functions of the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.799" offset="3854931">That Board altogether too frequently takes a parochial view of its own functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.805" offset="3886905">It was admonished not to do so in a different context, albeit a different context, but in a language that is landmark language of this Court in Southern Steamship.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.161" offset="3920342">It was told to accommodate itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.028" offset="3927761">In this case, we submit, the Labor Board should accommodate itself to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.332" offset="3953047">In this case, we submit that there is... because there is a contractual claim rather than an unfair labor practice issue, that makes inapposite respondent's reliance upon authority which, in turn, cites this Court's decisions in Acme, Strong, C&amp;C Plywood, and Carey.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.280" offset="4048760">As a matter of fact, those holdings do not govern this situation, and there is language in those holdings which we have cited at page 29 of our principal brief and pages 8 and 9 of our reply brief, which are helpful to us in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.659" offset="4118350">The contractual claim here was settled in May of 1973 when Wayne Howard, the first arbitrator, came down with his decision imposing greater duties upon union officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.216" offset="4176551">That remained the law of the parties, the law of that shop, unless reversed in negotiations or by a subsequent arbitrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.226" offset="4224616">Not only was it not reversed by a subsequent arbitrator, it was reaffirmed by a subsequent arbitrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.428" offset="4245410">It was also reaffirmed by the union in various ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.498" offset="4269651">The very same two union officers involved in this dispute four years before had involvement in another unfair labor practice strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.092" offset="4320016">In October of 1973 Lang and Light participated in an unlawful strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.697" offset="4354497">They were disciplined more severely at that time, just as they were disciplined four years later in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.851" offset="4379052">For their increased discipline, they did not grieve.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.505" offset="4401727">They sat on the union executive committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.921" offset="4411340">In the capacity of the union executive committee's members, they were the ones entrusted, according to Lang's testimony, they were the ones entrusted with the responsibility of determining whether or not they should grieve their own cases and other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.133" offset="4480198">Lang testified at the Joint Appendix, the brown one, at page 92 that they took into the grievance machinery and arbitration cases they liked, quote, liked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.374" offset="4529204">They didn't take their own cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.559" offset="4533906">As long ago as October of 1973 they recognized that they were bound by the May '73 arbitration award.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.896" offset="4563268">They took other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.515" offset="4569746">In December of 1974 there was yet another unlawful strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.467" offset="4589599">Following that unlawful strike, in which union officers were disciplined more severely, there was an arbitration hearing in September of 1975 before Arbitrator Jacob Seidenberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.508" offset="4629723">At the time of that hearing there was no challenge by the union to the fact of the duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.547" offset="4665877">The only challenge was as to whether the particular union officers had fulfilled their duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.767" offset="4686775">And Arbitrator Seidenberg found that in a couple of instances they had fulfilled their Howard duties... although he did not use the word "Howard duties", clearly he was talking about the same duties... and as a matter of fact, found that the union was correct in those instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.861" offset="4751140">In the other instance involving union officer participating in the unlawful strike, the arbitrator Seidenberg, the second arbitrator, rubber-stamped the first arbitrator, Wayne Howard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.685" offset="4798474">Now, it's... it's our contention that those facts, the prior involvement of Lang and Light, their recognizing the Howard decision, the subsequent arbitration and the facts leading up to that, the fact that the union didn't challenge in the arbitration decision, that was further rubber-stamping the original decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.463" offset="4869527">There were two renegotiations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.332" offset="4877051">There was no attempt made during those renegotiations to change the Howard decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.502" offset="4905681">As a matter of fact, the Seidenberg decision occurred before the second of the negotiations, and arising from the second negotiations the contract was signed on behalf of this union by the very same two individuals, Lang and Light.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.329" offset="4965031">And we submit that when they signed that contract including that no-strike clause, they were signing and rubber-stamping the Howard decision which they themselves had had a party in in October of '73 by not challenging those duties that were imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.123" offset="5032218">We have said that in this case it would... this case could dangerously erode the Steelworkers Trilogy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.396" offset="5065237">And the reason why we say that is because if respondents prevail in this case, it would mean that arbitration is not what this Court said it was: the terminal point of disagreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.537" offset="5113825">Indeed, it would allow the union a second bite at the apple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.541" offset="5141828">The union could take advantage of... and I mean not to impugn the Labor Board, but it is certainly not unknown for them to change their policies, and if I may use the word, there is some waffling that has gone on in many areas of law, including this, because as I am sure you are familiar from reading the briefs in this area of the law, prior to 1977, Justice Rehnquist's question about whether or not it was necessary to have the arbitration decision in order for us to prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.579" offset="5265962">In effect, that was the question that was asked, or whether there was a second issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.662" offset="5274321">At that time, prior to 1977, the National Labor Relations Board had held that it was not necessary to have an arbitration decision or duties spelled out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.838" offset="5323013">As a matter of fact, it was sufficient that there were union officers and greater... and greater duties were presumed and greater penalties could be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.492" offset="5353629">And in spite of the Board's attempt to say that that was not the clear rule of the National Labor Relations Board before 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.781" offset="5390827">Indeed it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.883" offset="5395216">In any event, there has been waffling by the Board on many issues, and there certainly would be... certainly could be in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.406" offset="5429279">A party can come in and collaterally attack... and that is what is being done here... collaterally attack decisions of the parties, arbitration decisions that are four years old, and by collaterally attacking those decisions, have them set aside because the Board's position has changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.569" offset="5517991">And by having them set aside, that would cause the party that had prevailed in those arbitration decisions to have been deprived of its bargain, a bargain that it may well have relied upon as here, as here as part of its no-strike obligation and in other contexts as part of some other obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.698" offset="5590507">And they may have made concessions during the course of negotiations based upon that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.102" offset="5612136">They may well have made withdrawals of demands based upon what they regarded as settled arbitral construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.188" offset="5640453">Instead, the Labor Board's changing fancy can be taken advantage of by an opportunistic party which would cause that settled arbitral construction to be set aside and which would further cause the windfall to the opportunistic party which this Court in its separate concurring and dissenting opinion in Magnovox sought to avoid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.871" offset="5727180">The Labor Board, by collaterally attacking settled arbitral construction of the contract, violated Congress' dual admonitions at section 203(d) of the Act that final adjustment of grievance disputes is desirable by a method agreed upon by the parties and to avoid industrial strife.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.384" offset="5817250">Their approach can only result in causing industrial strife.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.621" offset="5838148">They are attempting to straitjacket us... and when I say "us", I mean management in general and Metropolitan Edison in this case... in inapplicable statutory rights and in phantom waiver rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="1450.874" offset="5951206">Union officers Light and Lang engaged in the same unauthorized refusal to work as did the company's other employees, yet they received suspensions of 29 days, were warned that they would be discharged the next time, while the other employees received only 5 to 10-day suspensions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.173" offset="6052352">The notices issued to Lang and Light made clear that they had received the enhanced discipline because they were union officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.131" offset="6092162">It is the Board's position that such a disciplinary standard constitutes disparate treatment that forseeably discourages employees from engaging in the protected activity of assisting the union by serving as union officers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1553.156" offset="6360283">The Board's position permits the employer to discipline a union officer for engaging in an unauthorized work stoppage to the same extent that any other employee could be disciplined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.129" offset="6412215">Secondly, if there is evidence that the union officer actively led the strike or instigated it, the Board's position would permit more severe discipline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.687" offset="6466445">There is no such finding in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.675" offset="6478357">The Court of Appeals sustained the Board's finding that Light and Lang did not actively lead this strike nor call it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.547" offset="6517854">As a matter of fact, they made every effort to stop the strike, and they were ultimately successful in getting the picket line removed so that the men could return to work.</text>

            <text syncTime="2920.789" offset="11830847">Well, I view it, Mr. Chief Justice, as I say, the first of two steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.874" offset="11847147">Most... most... all of the courts below have said that the right may be waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.562" offset="11881942">We think they have come to that conclusion by not analyzing what this Court... the distinction this Court drew in Mastro Plastics on the one hand and on Magnovox and Gardner-Denver on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.454" offset="11929485">And the difference is between collective rights, the right to strike in Mastro which may be waived, and the... as basic associational rights which were involved in Magnovox, which this Court held could not be waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.880" offset="11991238">And as the Board said in a leading case which was cited by the Third Circuit below and by most of the other circuits that have dealt with this issue, General Motors Corp., the holding of union office is the essence of protected union activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.140" offset="12048290">The Court then drew the same distinction again in Gardner-Denver, which arose in the Title VII case, where Justice Powell speaking for a unanimous court, distinguished between collective rights of employees to strike and an individual employee's right to be free from employment discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.570" offset="12133971">Under Title VII, of course, it's race or sex discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.957" offset="12147555">But here there is another specifically prohibited form of employment discrimination, that based on union activity, to wit, the holding of union office and the exercise of union responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.265" offset="12200740">Now let me address a question that Justice White asked, was there a signal here?</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.102" offset="12228117">I would like to remind the Court of the context in which this case arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.572" offset="12242014">The signal was precisely the opposite, the administrative law judge found, and the Court of Appeals agreed, in effect, that the leaders virtually... Lang and Light... begged the employees before this incident on several occasions, you have a responsibility to cross the picket line of another union and go to work.</text>

            <text syncTime="3088.682" offset="12502402">Mr. Chief Justice, in my remaining time I would like to make several points which arose this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.550" offset="12521838">First the company contends that affirmance of the decision below would undermine the Steelworkers Trilogy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.755" offset="12554752">I submit that the Board's right to review contract language in order to determine statutory rights under the National Labor Relations Act first are different from the contractual issues which arbitrators resolve under the Trilogy, and second, the Board's authority to make those determinations has been expressly upheld in what I will call a quartet of later cases; specifically, C&amp;C Plywood, Acme, Strong, and Gardner-Denver.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.912" offset="12691320">After a thoroughgoing discussion of that issue in Acme, the Court had this sentence which I think sums up my point perfectly:</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.351" offset="12729041">"To view the Steelworkers decisions as automatically requiring the Board in this case to defer to the primary determination of an arbitrator is to overlook important distinction between those cases and this one. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.278" offset="12788809">That is at 385 U.S. 437.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.230" offset="12800616">Now, I think it is important to recall that a person who serves as an employee and a union official has two sets of duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.288" offset="12848786">As an employee, certainly he has obligations to the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.822" offset="12866967">As a union official, he has duties running only to the union and the union members... unless, of course, he waives the right as an employee to be free of employer discipline for the manner in which he exercises his official functions in the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.236" offset="12944603">And that gets us to the question of what does constitute an adequate waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.390" offset="12965292">That question had its genesis in Mastro Plastics, where this Court required an explicit waiver of statutory rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.615" offset="13010118">Since then the circuit courts and the Board have phrased it in terms of a clear and unmistakable waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.684" offset="13034465">We submit that no such waiver can be found in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.553" offset="13049929">There is no language in the agreement that imposes specific duties on union officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.374" offset="13069155">The general or neutral no-strike clause is not sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.659" offset="13086291">It wouldn't suffice under Mastro, and both the D.C. Circuit and Fifth Circuit have held it inadequate in these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.730" offset="13114608">The Howard and Seidenberg arbitration awards are not sufficient because they did not even purport to decide any statutory issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.538" offset="13153792">And as Justice O'Connor pointed out, they really didn't deal with any specific provisions in the contract itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.774" offset="13178765">In fact, if everything else the company said were correct, its argument would still fail, we believe, because of the language of section 9.2 paragraph 4 in the agreement, which is the arbitration provision, which states that arbitration decisions shall be</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.403" offset="13249296">"binding for the term of this agreement. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.021" offset="13259745">We think that was clearly a term of limitation on the precedential effect of awards that are issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.644" offset="13298301">The company throughout its two briefs cites the Elkouri text, which is the leading arbitration text.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.548" offset="13321916">There is an additional sentence which is not found in the company briefs:</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.317" offset="13336962">"The parties are free in any case to stipulate as to what precedential role a forthcoming award shall play. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.188" offset="13368414">That is at 379 of the Elkouri book.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.790" offset="13382834">That is precisely what they have done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.742" offset="13394641">Now, Justice O'Connor, contrary to my distinguished colleague, I would argue that the phrase in the agreement is not surplusage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.765" offset="13430794">He says it occurs throughout the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.567" offset="13441975">In fact, their brief cites only five instances in an agreement of almost 60 pages where it is found.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.454" offset="13465485">With the exception of the no-strike clause, none of the provisions in the agreement which Mr. Sileo cited earlier were in fact mentioned by arbitrators Howard or Seidenberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.963" offset="13519506">And finally the... well, I made that point already.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.515" offset="13533717">The other point I would like to make is that unions and employers alike agree about the destructiveness of wildcat strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.021" offset="13575722">Where we differ is on the question of whether disparate discipline of union officials helps that problem or exacerbates it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.627" offset="13610203">We think it exacerbates it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.429" offset="13621384">Although I differ in some respects from some of Justice Powell's concurring opinion in Complete Auto Transit, I think he summed up the problem in this one sentence in a wildcat situation:</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.838" offset="13674987">"Worker recalcitrance sometimes is directed at the incumbent union leadership as much as at company management. "</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald F. Sileo</label>
            <text syncTime="3401.050" offset="13751891">First of all, with respect to the facts in this case, I think it important to note that contrary to the Heist situation, which was quoted or referred to by Mr. Cohen, the union officers in this case made no effort whatsoever during the strike to be of any help.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.717" offset="13858576">As a matter of fact, contrary-wise, they refused to cross the picket line in spite of being told to do so repeatedly, in spite of being told that they would be in big trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.390" offset="13893266">And at one point union officer Lang contemptuously said, listen, if we cross this picket line of the operating engineers and next year we have our own picket line during negotiations, well, they'll cross our picket line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.887" offset="13967245">And I submit to you that that shows a contemptuous disregard of their duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.756" offset="13986680">Throughout the strike there was no effort made to be of help.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.826" offset="14002980">Prior to the strike, the fact that they spoke to the rank-and-file membership and they sought to have the rank-and-file members cooperate in the event there would be a similar incident to that which occurred on October 4th, where there was a refusal to cross a picket line, their efforts prior to August 30th, if anything, demonstrate that the union officers recognized they had a duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.673" offset="14094409">They recognized that duty, and they fulfilled that duty prior to the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.310" offset="14116874">But that was days before the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.529" offset="14125756">And then when they were met with... when they were rebuffed, instead of seeking perhaps union sanctions or seeking some kind of creative way to avoid what they foresaw, they just treated it as inevitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.771" offset="14182807">And when the strike occurred, they reacted as if their primary concern was their internal union political situation instead of the no-strike clause which they had signed, which was far and away the most important aspect of their responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.531" offset="14245815">As far as the analysis that was suggested by Justice Rehnquist, which was to the effect that we first have to decide whether there has been a violation, we decided there has been a violation of section 8(a)(3) if we have similarly situated individuals treated differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.563" offset="14337975">That's what happened in Erie Resistor, that's what happened in Great Dane Trailer: similarly situated individuals treated differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.502" offset="14373710">And that's why, having treated them differently in those cases, that was discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.656" offset="14394295">Here we don't have similarly situated individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.942" offset="14407460">We have rank-and-file employees juxtaposed against union officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.846" offset="14427105">We say they are not similarly situated, for two reasons: number one, because as union officers they inherently have a greater responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.083" offset="14460019">As union officers they... and stewards... they have a responsibility to lead.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.070" offset="14479976">This Court recognized those leadership qualities in the Weingarten case, an entirely different... in an entirely different context, but where you encouraged that if the rank-and-file employee wants a union officer or a steward present, he should have that steward present.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.448" offset="14545491">Why should we presume that the union officer or the steward at the picket line is going to be so ineffectual?</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.352" offset="14573077">There is no reason for us to presume that from a factual standpoint at all.</text>
