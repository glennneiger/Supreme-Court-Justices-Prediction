          <heading>Argument of Alan G. Segedy</heading>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="0.000" stopTime="78.170">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="152025">We will hear arguments next in City of Akron against Akron Center for Reproductive Health.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.226" offset="216913">Mr. Segedy, I think you may proceed when you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alan_g_segedy" startTime="78.170" stopTime="236.544">
            <label>Mr. Alan G. Segedy</label>
            <text syncTime="78.170" offset="464658">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the principal issues presented in this case are whether the state may reasonably regulate in the area of abortion in a manner designed to ensure an informed decision by a pregnant woman in a situation where there in fact is no physician-patient relationship; likewise, whether the state may require parental consent or judicial consent as a prerequisite to an abortion to be performed upon an immature minor; and finally, exactly what is the standard of review that should be applied in the testing of abortion-related legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.341" offset="629334">The Akron ordinance was passed on February 28, 1978, amongst considerable controversy, but contrary to the characterization by the cross-petitioners that this was a drastic departure from normal legislative procedure, this ordinance and the process whereby it was enacted is probably one of the finest examples of the legislative process on the local level.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.675" offset="730689">There were at least four public hearings on this ordinance, including an entire day spent with expert medical testimony with doctors from all over the country, and likewise an entire day of legal testimony with respect to legal experts rendering their opinions as to the constitutionality of this ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.809" offset="803205">I would point out to the Court that the ordinance has not been challenged by a pregnant woman, but has been challenged by three abortion clinics and a doctor who resides approximately 300 miles from the City of Akron.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.348" offset="857331">This case represents a real lawsuit with real parties and real evidence and a trial that lasted for about two-and-a-half weeks, and I think when the Court reviews the record, it will be eminently clear that in the abortion situation in the City of Akron, there is no physician-patient relationship anywhere near what this Court envisioned in the case of Roe versus Wade.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.337" offset="965269">When the Sixth Circuit tested this legislation it applied a two-tier test; first, to determine whether or not there was any legally significant impact or consequence on the abortion decision, and if there was, the court determined that there must be a compelling state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.253" offset="1041024">The court then concluded that if the regulation impacted on the first trimester of pregnancy, by its interpretation of Roe versus Wade, the state necessarily did not have a compelling state interest.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="236.544" stopTime="249.226">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="236.544" offset="1098180">When you suggested that no patient was challenging the statute, did you mean to suggest that only a patient could challenge the statute?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alan_g_segedy" startTime="249.226" stopTime="447.519">
            <label>Mr. Alan G. Segedy</label>
            <text syncTime="249.226" offset="1148858">No, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.975" offset="1151888">I just point that out in reference to the considerations with respect to the parental consent provisions and with respect to minors challenging the statute with respect to parental consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.736" offset="1206954">Clearly Roe versus Wade and subsequent cases tell us that there can be standing by jus tertii on the part of the physician.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.386" offset="1237569">The City of Akron recognizes that.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.481" offset="1245929">However, the city would submit that the proper standard of review that should be applied, and the standard which this Court has reiterated is whether or not the regulation is unduly burdensome on the woman's decision to have an abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.677" offset="1306637">This Court stated in Roe versus Wade, and reiterated numerous times that that decision did not represent abortion on demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.814" offset="1343209">The right that is contained which the Court recognized in Roe versus Wade was not simply the right to have an abortion, but the right to make that choice either to have an abortion or to bear a child.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.388" offset="1405485">The essential right is that freedom of choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.262" offset="1416978">The abortion clinics in this case, as the record shows, make certain assumptions with respect to this situation, the first of which is that abortion is always the best choice for the pregnant woman; secondly, that the abortion clinics' interests always align in essentially a one-to-one correspondence with the pregnant woman or the minor; and finally, that the interests of the state or the City of Akron in this case or the parents are somehow adverse to that of the pregnant woman or the pregnant minor.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.621" offset="1562428">This Court has recognized interest in maternal health, potential life, and maintaining medical standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.601" offset="1590327">The City of Akron would submit there is also another important interest involved in this area which this Court has not had to face yet, because it has not come up in any particular fact situation, and that is, the city or the state has an interest in protecting the woman's own constitutional right of her freedom of choice as to whether or not to have an abortion or whether to carry her child, her unborn child to term.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.028" offset="1696071">The city would submit this is an important interest, in fact compelling, and exists throughout the entire spectrum of the pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.182" offset="1728672">The consideration of an abortion statute should not simply be a matter of determining that automatically there must be a compelling state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.553" offset="1774229">I think the courts below must look at a regulation and determine whether or not there is any impact on the abortion decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.970" offset="1803904">That impact may be choice-enhancing, or that impact may burden... be burdensome.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.328" offset="1825325">If in fact the impact is burdensome, the city would submit that there must be a determination of whether or not there is a substantial burden on the woman's right to choose.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.809" offset="1867225">If there is a substantial burden, as in Roe versus Wade or Planned Parenthood versus Danforth with respect to the parental veto, then there must be a compelling state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.899" offset="1903587">On the contrary, if the burden is only insubstantial, all the state need show is that there is a rational basis for the legislation.</text>

            <text syncTime="590.900" offset="2515584">I would point out to the Court, if the Court has concern about that, under the O'Bannon case, which deals with this question with respect to the raising of a question and the waiver, that the respondents in this case, Dr. Seguin and Mrs. Black, may raise those questions under Rule 21.4, I believe it is, and that is exactly the situation we have here, as in the O'Bannon case, where the dispute was between HEW and the Department of Welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.264" offset="2633031">The City of Akron submits that the major thrust of this legislation is not burdensome on the choice of the pregnant woman, but is rather choice-enhancing.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.804" offset="2683186">And the city would also submit that under the facts of this case, and it is very important that the record be viewed very... very carefully, that as the physician relationship, physician-patient relationship diminishes, the state's interest in protecting that relationship increases.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.857" offset="2759359">And what this record shows is that there is no physician-patient relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.841" offset="2779316">A primary example of that would be that the woman signs her informed consent form prior to the time that she ever sees a physician, and that is undisputed and clear in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.133" offset="2828531">The Sixth Circuit struck down the informed consent provision on the basis of it impacting upon the first trimester of pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.223" offset="2860818">However, this Court has upheld informed consent in Planned Parenthood versus Danforth... excuse me, in Planned Parenthood versus Danforth, in principle, by a general informed consent, and likewise in Franklin versus Fitzpatrick, by summary affirmance, and by implication in H.L. versus Matheson by way of a footnote approving a detailed informed consent provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.042" offset="2956113">Again, the city would submit that there is this compelling interest of the state in the choice of the woman, that is, her fundamental constitutional right, and the city may protect that choice by ensuring that there is a physician-patient relationship, as the Court envisioned in Roe versus Wade.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.017" offset="3040018">This provision creates no burden on the woman's decision, and it provides flexibility for the physician.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.735" offset="3070947">We would point out to the Court in 1870.06(c), it is provided that the physician shall provide such other information as he deems is relevant to the woman's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.324" offset="3117236">It is charged that the provision is one-sided, that is, the information goes toward possibly what might lead her not to decide to have an abortion, but the purpose for that is looking at what is the danger of risk of non-information, which way does that risk go, toward the physician underinforming toward abortion or toward going to term?</text>
            <text syncTime="765.485" offset="3213889">In 1870.05(b), the Court struck down the parental consent provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.763" offset="3259029">As we pointed out to the Court already, there was no woman or no minor at all who challenged this provision, only the abortion clinics and Dr. Bliss.</text>

            <text syncTime="1042.338" offset="4321377">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I would like to address the issue of the standard of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.411" offset="4353664">One way to view the cases now before the Court is that they are simply the next in a series of cases in which over the past decade the Court has developed a rather detailed body of federal constitutional rules dealing with abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.983" offset="4411865">Under that view, the Court's task today is to consider about a dozen separate provisions of state and local law and declare each of them either constitutional or unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.227" offset="4460871">The result will be that the outline of applicable federal constitutional rules is longer and more detailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.884" offset="4487516">We would then await the next round of abortion cases two or three years down the road, and another after that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.895" offset="4515519">The approach that we urge is different, but consistent with this Court's precedents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.581" offset="4538298">It involves two steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.109" offset="4544358">The first is a recognition that as Mr. Segedy has said, a decade of this Court's abortion decisions have now established that not every abortion regulation is governed by the compelling state interest test, but only those that unduly burden the woman's decision whether to have an abortion or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.415" offset="4613635">The second step would be to declare that in making that key determination, ultimately a judicial determination, concerning which practices do and which do not unduly burden the abortion decision, the Court should be mindful of four things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.705" offset="4690748">The first is that most of the questions dealing with the undue burden issue have substantial factual components.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.968" offset="4727842">These cases are illustrative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.418" offset="4733694">Does the 24-hour delay requirement lead, or does it not, to a better informed decision?</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.511" offset="4754069">Comparative safety of hospitals and non-hospital facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.963" offset="4771832">And you could go right down the list.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.679" offset="4778729">By the time that a lawsuit brings the total issues into court, the competing arguments concerning these factual components have already been addressed and resolved by a legislature which, for reasons discussed in our brief, is better qualified as an institution to deal with factual issues than is a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.893" offset="4863574">And to the extent that the issues are non-factual... this is my second point... they involve a blend of constitutional law and also policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.545" offset="4894190">The resolution of these two kinds of issues, constitutional law on the one hand and public policy on the other, are the core functions of courts on the one hand and legislatures on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.646" offset="4954585">So that the real question in these cases is this: in those areas of overlap between legislative authority and judicial authority, such as abortion cases are, cases which necessarily involve both the making of policy and also declaring constitutional law, should the courts regard the process as one of policy-making or legal decision-making, or is there some room for accommodating the two, for recognizing that what is really involved is a combination of the core functions of both branches?</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.695" offset="5106722">We believe that there is, and that the accommodation comes about in the following fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.674" offset="5134621">First, at the end of the day, the ultimate decision must be made by the courts, but in exercising this ultimate and awesome power, the courts must be mindful that the kinds of competing considerations that enter into its decision have already been taken into account by a representative legislative body exercising its own responsibility to make policy decisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1300.494" offset="5353945">Now, in fact, as Mr. Segedy has said, and as the record in fact discloses, this is a good example of a legislative body that did its job the way it should, by hearing both sides of those issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.191" offset="5400756">And it did reach these very issues of which we are talking about.</text>

            <text syncTime="1349.771" offset="5551013">"Roe v. Wade can be understood only by considering both the woman's interest and the nature of the state's interference with it. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.925" offset="5575672">One of the similarities between courts and legislatures is that both from time to time engage in the balancing process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.685" offset="5606706">One of the differences is that legislatures do it better.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.386" offset="5629485">Balancing by its very definition is virtually synonymous with policy-making, choosing between competing values, and the optimum balance almost always depends on issues of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.678" offset="5686641">To the extent, therefore, and this is the accommodation of which I spoke, the judicial balancing is required, as it is under this Court's decisions, considerations of judicial efficiency and also separation of powers are best served by judicial recognition of the fact that the same balancing process or almost the same has already been undertaken by an institution of government which is better qualified to perform the function and within whose institutional bailiwick balancing lies at the very center.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.447" offset="5813805">Different states and political subdivisions will approach these problems and strike their respective balances in different ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.472" offset="5837837">Some will adopt laws diametrically opposed to others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.911" offset="5851630">But as Justice Brandeis reminded us several decades ago, and as this Court quoted in the Maher case,</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.720" offset="5878902">"The diversity that results from state and local authority to attack a common problem in different ways, even in opposing ways, is part of the genius in a federal system of government. "</text>

            <text syncTime="1548.811" offset="6347225">But there is a constitutionally significant difference between the kind of yes or no answer as to whether abortion is or is not prohibited by the Constitution that was involved in Roe v.

            <text syncTime="1575.503" offset="6454014">We simply submit that after a decade of this Court's decisions which have raised the question that is before the Court as to whether it is compelling state interest that applies across the boards or whether we have now reached the point that it is only the undue burden, that rather than having these cases come back year after year after year, with the list of applicable federal constitutional rules becoming longer and longer and longer, that the time has now come to apply those principles that the Court has so well developed in other areas dealing with substantive due process to this area of the law which also rests on substantive due process, and at least to take into account the fact that another governmental decision or another governmental body also charged with the responsibility of facing these same kinds of questions has faced them, and that they have resolved them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.294" offset="6669158">A final consideration is that to whatever extent a public policy issue is constitutionalized, all but one of the competing points of view are eliminated as acceptable alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.255" offset="6713044">One of the cornerstones of a free society is that the search for truth is enhanced by permitting full and uninhibited discussion of public issues by leaving those issues exposed for a time to the legislative process and public discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.813" offset="6767274">The point is not, therefore, that courts should stay out of controversial issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.561" offset="6782216">It is, rather, that since the power that the Court brings to the issue is, as Justice Brandeis again pointed out, and Justice Holmes in his dissent in Abrams, to remove it from public debate.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephan Landsman</label>
            <text syncTime="1685.411" offset="6893602">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the Akron ordinance before the Court today requires that when any woman seeks an abortion in the City of Akron, she and her physician must comply with at least 14 separate and distinct requirements before the procedure may be performed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.935" offset="6963715">If she is a minor or she seeks a second trimester procedure, the number is far greater.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.993" offset="6983986">All the ordinance requirements must be satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.745" offset="6998928">None can be avoided, regardless of the woman's personal circumstances or her medical condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.898" offset="7023587">Any deviation from even one requirement will expose the physician to up to six months in jail, a $1,000 fine, and potential loss of license.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.893" offset="7059532">I would like to begin my argument with a discussion of the constitutional standard applicable in this case, and then turn to the various sections of the ordinance, beginning with the informed consent script and the 24-hour delay, the ban on clinical second trimester procedures, and the minor's veto.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.966" offset="7127868">In Roe versus Wade, this Court held that a woman had a fundamental right, in consultation with her physician, to choose whether to terminate a pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.462" offset="7173844">As this Court indicated in Roe and reiterated as recently as Harris versus McRae, regulations restricting this fundamental right are presumptively unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.580" offset="7214281">In order to sustain abortion regulations, the state has a heavy burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.751" offset="7234970">Either it must show that those regulations do not restrict the woman's decision, as this Court identified in the Danforth case, or if the plaintiffs demonstrate that a regulation imposes a cognizable burden, then the regulation be supported by a compelling state interest and be narrowly drawn to support only that interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="1830.289" offset="7473103">The compelling interest in maternal health becomes a state interest that can be effectuated in the second trimester, as this Court indicated in Roe.</text>

            <text syncTime="1841.146" offset="7516570">The Solicitor General and the defendants do not challenge this Court's determination that the right to choose is fundamental.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.844" offset="7543320">However, they would have the Court stand the burden of proof rule in fundamental rights cases on its head, and force the plaintiff to show in each and every case an undue burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.464" offset="7585847">It would not appear that the state has any responsibility under the test suggested by the Solicitor General and the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.151" offset="7612596">This proposal would undercut Roe's finding of fundamentality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.616" offset="7630464">It would make all restrictive abortion regulations presumptively constitutional, and place the onus on the plaintiffs in each and every case to show their undue burdensomeness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.971" offset="7675813">Besides directly undercutting Roe's declaration of fundamentality, the undue burden test creates other problems as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.137" offset="7708518">As the Solicitor General admits in his brief at Page 10, the undue burden test is one of breadth and ambiguity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.136" offset="7736521">It is essentially a standardless and ad hoc test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.368" offset="7753449">In Gertz versus Robert Welch, this Court considered and rejected a similar ad hoc test in the First Amendment area, because this Court felt it would lead to unpredictable results, uncertainty of expectations, and would render this Court's supervisory powers impossible to be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.484" offset="7825860">The Solicitor General has an alternative solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.481" offset="7841847">He suggests that the judiciary defer in any fundamental rights case where a legislative policy choice is arguably at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.589" offset="7874343">It is a rule as old as Marbury versus Madison that the courts must apply the relevant constitutional standards rather than defer to a coequal branch on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.508" offset="7918020">There are a variety of reasons for this rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.412" offset="7929618">Perhaps most important, any other choice would undermine the enforcement of fundamental constitutional rights by allowing impassioned majorities to restrict liberty interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.642" offset="7974549">It would also render impossible the task of developing a coherent body of constitutional principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.623" offset="8002448">Justice O'Connor asked Mr. Segedy what interest does the state rely on in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.261" offset="8028988">I would cite to the Court the questions presented for review in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.195" offset="8052707">Akron relies on one and only one interest in its questions, whether the state's interest in maternal health and well-being is such that it may regulate abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.397" offset="8089592">There is no other state interest being advanced, at least pursuant to the questions presented on which certiorari was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.627" offset="8118432">The first section I would like to consider was enacted under the rubric of informed consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.500" offset="8141942">Both of the two parts of this section that were held unconstitutional were held to impinge upon the woman's right to choose whether to terminate her pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.058" offset="8180185">The first of these two forces the attending physician, on pain of incarceration, to recite in each and every case, without exception, seven scripted statements, including Akron's assertion that human life begins at the moment of conception, and a fetal description promoting that view, as well as a variety of medically inaccurate assertions about the abortion procedure and risks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.656" offset="8286556">The second of these two sections forces the attending physician in each and every case, or face jail, to recite individualized risk and technique information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.840" offset="8331382">The plaintiffs proved that the proposed requirements directly and substantially interfere with the abortion decision and its effectuation by robbing the woman of independence in the abortion decision-making process and by straightjacketing her physician.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.055" offset="8396165">Plaintiffs proved that both sections deprive each woman of control of the abortion decision-making process, first by compelling her to hear an array of prescribed materials that she can never direct her physician not to recite.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.297" offset="8457187">Both the woman and her physician may indeed face prosecution if the scripted materials are not recited before every abortion in Akron.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.448" offset="8489788">There is no exception under any circumstances whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.745" offset="8506925">The second way in which the decision-making process is burdened is that it requires the woman to consider misinformation, and the record demonstrated that it was misinformation, that is likely to interfere with her decision-making capacity rather than assist her in making a considered choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.879" offset="8575470">The third way in which these materials interfere with the decision-making process is that they force her physician to be the bearer of what plaintiff's expert described as potentially inflammatory information, turning the physician into the adversary rather than the advisor of the woman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.168" offset="8640672">The sections are clearly slanted against abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.619" offset="8654464">There is not one word in them that is favorable to the abortion choice, and they treat women as irrational decision-makers who must be forced to reconsider their choice of an abortion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2735.058" offset="11092211">And the health risks involved in the two to seven-day delay were shown by the evidence here to be very serious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.867" offset="11115408">Additionally, Your Honor, an item we have not at all touched on is the cost factor involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.726" offset="11134843">Now, by compelling women to come and visit these clinics on two separate occasions, what we are requiring them to do is to make two trips across the state of Ohio in order to get an abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.957" offset="11179774">Three-quarters of the women who seek abortions in Akron do not live in the City of Akron.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.204" offset="11196805">Many come from as far away as Columbus, Ohio, and various cities and towns in West Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.343" offset="11217390">The cost factor involved in two trips to Akron will raise the cost of abortion tremendously.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.686" offset="11238706">The alternative, of course, is to rent lodgings in Akron, and to wait the appropriate amount of time or more.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.307" offset="11265246">The 24-hour delay requirement also will impact on those who have employment by forcing them to miss work; those who have families, by forcing them to pay extra child care expenses and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.378" offset="11305475">And, of course, underlying all this is the feeling of the woman that she wants to have privacy in this choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.266" offset="11333060">If you go to a clinic on one afternoon, it is easy to rearrange your schedule to do so, but when you have to go back again a second time, it becomes an issue that raises substantial questions, and privacy may very well be breached in this matter as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="2837.860" offset="11503378">What we are saying is that every regulation enacted by a state that clearly burdens the woman's choice, as this does with respect to cost, with respect to risks, and so forth and so on, must be justified by a compelling state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.463" offset="11573805">And in this case, Akron has presented nothing even approximating a compelling state interest, and that makes this statute, this ordinance section invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.425" offset="11613720">The defendant's response to the showing of burden was a concession, first of all, that the 24-hour delay does impose a restriction on a woman's access to abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.951" offset="11663770">That is at Page 47 of their brief to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.186" offset="11672756">The court of appeals found that the defendants produced absolutely no evidence to justify their delay in the abortion setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.495" offset="11705984">That is at Page 17-A of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.073" offset="11716224">In the appendix submitted to this Court with the factual materials of this case, defendant's proof in defense of the 24-hour delay requirement amounted to approximately four sentences spoken by one expert witness who does not provide any surgical care or require a waiting period when he seeks the informed consent of psychotic in-patients with respect to experimental procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.952" offset="11823744">This quantum of evidence fails to satisfy the appropriate constitutional standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.918" offset="11847672">Because time is of the essence in the abortion decision, as this Court noted in Doe versus Bolton, and defendant's abject failure of proof, this section is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.398" offset="11893543">Seven courts of appeals and eleven district courts have reached precisely the same conclusion, and struck down waiting periods of varying lengths.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.331" offset="11929279">Further, the blanket delay requirement is not narrowly drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.769" offset="11947042">As concurring Judge Kennedy in the court of appeals indicated, you can never get out of the 24-hour delay requirement where it is medically contraindicated, or where previous counseling has been had, as it has in three-quarters of the cases in Akron, or where the cost increases are overwhelming.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.590" offset="12018304">The next section of the ordinance I would like to address is Section 1870.03, which bans second trimester abortions in clinics and requires their performance be confined to JCAH accredited hospitals exclusively.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.910" offset="12083610">This is the only section of the ordinance before the Court today that was upheld in the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.096" offset="12104404">The plaintiffs proved, and the Sixth Circuit found, that the JCAH hospital requirement directly and substantially interferes with the effectuation of the abortion decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.421" offset="12149648">The circuit court found that the section forces 10 percent of Akron women seeking abortions to travel to places as far away as Michigan to obtain abortions, or, alternatively, to choose such dangerous alternatives as self-abortion or illegal abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.835" offset="12219343">The court of appeals also found that this requirement raises the cost of abortions for Akron women from between $300 and $550.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.705" offset="12266781">For those women who cannot travel or do not have sufficient funds, as the court of appeals indicated, those who are generally young, poor, or black, the section deprives them of any, and I quote here,</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.215" offset="12316832">"real opportunity to obtain an abortion. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.087" offset="12332296">Plaintiffs proved not only the burdensome nature of this JCAH requirement, but that there was no medical justification for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.085" offset="12364270">The overwhelming scientific evidence in this case indicates that second trimester abortion procedures are safer than childbirth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.941" offset="12399692">Similarly, voluminous evidence indicates that such procedures may be performed safely in freestanding out-patient clinics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.641" offset="12442533">This evidence has led amicus, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, to specifically endorse second trimester abortions in freestanding clinics up to 18 weeks of gestation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3217.613" offset="13022451">They offered virtually no evidence other than the American College's now repealed standard of 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.594" offset="13050350">In the appendix provided to this Court, the defendants do not cite a single sentence or a single line in support of the ban they would impose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.181" offset="13092668">In the Danforth case, this Court invalidated the Missouri regulation prohibiting the use of saline amniocentesis because saline abortions were commonly used nationally, safer than childbirth, and their prohibition would force physicians and patients to more dangerous alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.019" offset="13160064">The Akron situation is identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.924" offset="13171663">Further, in Doe versus Bolton, this Court rejected a JCAH hospital requirement for abortions including second trimester procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.092" offset="13208338">Akron's JCAH requirement is identical to Bolton's, and is similarly not narrowly drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.309" offset="13237178">The next section of the ordinance I would like to address is Section 1870.05(b), which mandates parental or judicial consent with respect to the abortion of every minor less than 15 years of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.661" offset="13290572">This requirement was held both by the district court and the court of appeals to impose a blanket veto on the abortion decision of every minor under 15.</text>

            <text syncTime="3466.418" offset="14017612">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I would like to briefly discuss with the Court some of the points that are shown in the record with respect to the operation of the abortion clinics in Akron.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.397" offset="14065573">First of all, the abortion clinics are commercial enterprises that are owned by laymen, operated for profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.049" offset="14092218">They run ads in the newspaper in which they advertise the finest medical care, the best medical care, safe and legal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.517" offset="14121997">When the woman goes to the abortion clinic, she is not going to her physician or any particular physician.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.888" offset="14147493">She in fact has no idea who the physician is going to be at the abortion clinic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.274" offset="14169018">She is counseled by lay persons, and many times these counselors have no training.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.116" offset="14192423">One counselor, for example, had some experience as a respiratory therapist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.647" offset="14210605">The counseling is done in group sessions 85 percent of the time, and the record shows also that the counseling is done with minors mixed in groups with adults in this group counseling session.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.908" offset="14263581">One of the clinic counselors, as is shown in the Joint Appendix at Page 247 through 258, testified that all of the information contained in 1870-06(b) is not only irrelevant but harassing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.073" offset="14336306">The record shows that the patients are often given tranquilizers on standing physician orders before they ever sign the informed consent forms, before they ever see the physician.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.207" offset="14384789">Doctor C, one of the doctors testifying under a pseudonym, testified that he in fact treats his patients, his private patients, differently than he treats the patients in the abortion clinics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.324" offset="14441318">Dr. B testified that he never attempts to judge the maturity of a minor.</text>

            <text syncTime="3580.384" offset="14473501">Your Honor, I believe it was because they were afraid of harassment or such.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.697" offset="14490742">I believe they filed affidavits to that effect in order to have that status.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.443" offset="14509759">What the record clearly shows inevitably is that in every case the woman signs the informed consent form prior to the time that she sees her physician, and she spends about five to ten minutes with the physician, including the surgical procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.467" offset="14589798">The physician essentially at most, according to this record, will ask the woman if she has any questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.198" offset="14624802">Contrary to what Mr. Landsman stated to the Court, Section 1870.06(b) does not hamstring the physician.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.430" offset="14665658">He is not required, or not prevented from providing whatever information he would like to provide in addition to what is contained in that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.815" offset="14703274">In fact, he can dispute that information with a patient if he so chooses, but he is expressly directed by 1870.06(c) to provide this other relevant information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.780" offset="14743085">Mr. Justice Powell, in reference to your question about notice to parents, I would point out to the Court that notice in this situation under Ohio law, if notice would be given, would only be after the minor has gone to court, and would be under the protection of the court, and this would in effect be putting the abortion practice in compliance with the other medical treatment in terms of treating minors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.751" offset="14851023">Dr. Seguin, one of the defendant intervenors who is also a pediatrician, testified that this is the standard practice, to go to the juvenile court if a minor needs medical attention, and the first consideration is always to protect the minor, which is also the consideration of the juvenile court under Ohio law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3694.854" offset="14931375">The second trimester hospital requirement was upheld by summary affirmance by this Court in Gary-Northwest versus Orr.</text>
            <text syncTime="3706.225" offset="14976828">The testimony that took place in the trial of this case, and that is why I pointed out to the Court there was a real lawsuit here with real witnesses and real evidence, the testimony showed by numerous physicians, including Dr. Schmidt, who was then the outgoing president of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, that all second trimester abortions should be performed in a hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="3729.591" offset="15070347">That likewise met the ACOG standards that were in effect at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3734.808" offset="15091245">With reference to the current ACOG standards that just came out this year, they do not say that it is simply safe to do second trimester abortions outside of a hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="3746.425" offset="15137638">They say that up to 18 weeks, they may be done in a freestanding surgical facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3752.723" offset="15162820">In regard to Justice Powell's questions, the abortion clinics are not freestanding surgical facilities, and do not comply with their requirements.</text>
