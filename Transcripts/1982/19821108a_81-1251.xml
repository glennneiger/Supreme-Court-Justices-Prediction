            <label>Mr. William F. Wessel</label>
            <text syncTime="82.541" offset="480038">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the case before you today is a case involving a public employee who was dismissed from service because of actions surrounding a job movement, that is, moving an assistant district attorney from one section of the court to another section of the court in the Orleans Parish criminal justice system.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.018" offset="570004">The action to transfer the assistant district attorney was followed up by the assistant district attorney circulating a questionnaire, which is in the records, which pertained... over 90 percent of the questionnaire pertained to matters surrounding the transfer, and one question pertained to a question about the integrity or the confidence that other assistant district attorneys may or may not have had in the supervising trial assistant who took part in the decision to have him transferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.269" offset="722977">Another question in the questionnaire outside of the questions that directly pertained to the transfer was a question as to whether or not the other assistant district attorneys felt pressured to engage in political campaigns.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.572" offset="796224">The central issue around this case falls on Pickering, decided by this Court, and Pickering left us no standards in a case where a public employee is terminated for voicing concerns that he could voice or would voice as a private citizen on matters of legitimate public concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.392" offset="895490">The Court has not left the circuits any standards by which to determine what is a matter of legitimate public concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.699" offset="944704">By reason of that, the circuits have gone askew in determining what is a matter of public concern, and in some instances have done the balancing required by Pickering in order to determine what is a matter of public concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.722" offset="1020773">In Pickering, of course, we had a non-employment setting about a matter pertaining to a bond issue and how... why the bond issue should or should not be voted upon by the population.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.467" offset="1083780">The teacher there voiced his concern in the public media about the bond issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.822" offset="1113142">In Givhan, decided by... remanded by this Court, we had an employee setting rather than a non-employee setting, an employee setting about racially discriminatory policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.002" offset="1177926">That matter was remanded by this Court to determine whether or not there was another reason for the firing in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.203" offset="1214706">In this particular case, we have an employee setting again, rather than a public setting, but we have a questionnaire pertaining to a private quarrel or petty bickering of the employee pertaining to a transfer of that assistant district attorney from one section of court to another section of court.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.409" offset="1319509">The questionnaire throughout points out the culmination of the events that took place prior to the questionnaire being circulated, and it is important in that regard to determine... to look at the facts as they were presented at the trial level.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.947" offset="1401743">The evening before the distribution of the questionnaire, the assistant district attorney in this case was told that she was going to be transferred to another section of court and was given a written memo to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.866" offset="1465377">The written memo was returned by her to the first assistant district attorney that evening with a complaint on it, why didn't you tell me about it before, and with an indication that her name was spelled wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.204" offset="1522742">The next morning, she had been visited by the district attorney himself at approximately 8:00 or 8:30 in the morning, in the courtroom where she had her office, with a personal request to acquiesce in the decision to transfer her from one section of court to the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.931" offset="1593586">The district attorney had come from home, had not planned to work that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.443" offset="1611663">He was home with a sick wife at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.583" offset="1620231">And he made a personal request to her.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.879" offset="1633397">Thereafter, he returned to his office to pack his briefcase to return home.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.612" offset="1652309">He was informed by the first assistant that the assistant district attorney, Ms. Myers, had told him she would not accept the transfer and would not move to the other section of court.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.592" offset="1692224">This was an intervening event that took place between his personal request of Ms. Myers in her section of court that morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.932" offset="1733602">Later on that morning, at about noon, the first assistant called the district attorney and told him, Ms. Myers is circulating a questionnaire, and she is creating a mini-insurrection, what do you want me to do about it?</text>
            <text syncTime="415.111" offset="1810298">Whereupon, Mr. Connick, the district attorney, returned to the office and he inquired of the questionnaire, was informed by the chief of trials under whom Ms. Myers was to be transferred that he had spoken to Ms. Myers and she told him she wasn't going to accept the transfer, that she was going to quit rather than accept the transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.039" offset="1894099">The questionnaire was then circulated, and Mr. Connick, of course, had returned to the office, and at that point in time he informed her that she was fired.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.475" offset="1935790">Ms. Myers testified and Mr. Connick testified that she was being fired for two reasons, for refusing to accept the transfer and refusing... for refusing to accept the transfer and for having circulated the questionnaire with a... or a question in the questionnaire being particularly offensive to the district attorney at the time pertaining to the integrity of the six chiefs, chief assistants who had participated in the decision to transfer the individual.</text>

            <text syncTime="1997.684" offset="8140603">The... Ms. Myers did receive informal notice prior... maybe two days prior to the circulation of the questionnaire that she was to be tansferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.944" offset="8189713">The findings of fact made by the district court are not clearly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.441" offset="8223673">They are supported, amply supported in the record of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.657" offset="8240495">They are, of course, facts to which this Court has frequently held that Rule 52(a) applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.828" offset="8269230">Indeed, it seems to me that they are also insulated from review by this Court's well established two-court rule, because the Fifth Circuit also heard the same argument that Mr. Wessel is making today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.553" offset="8328162">The... Mr. Wessel says that the district court never considered the reasons put forward by Mr. Connick for the... his... the basis for the firing, that is, his reasons that there had been a refusal to accept the transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.186" offset="8418651">That is simply not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.840" offset="8429308">The judge did... Judge Gordon did consider that, and it is clear in his opinion that he found that Sheila Myers had not refused a transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.961" offset="8477792">He found that Mr. Connick did not believe she had refused a transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.428" offset="8507571">Indeed, when Mr. Connick came back to his office after hearing about the questionnaire, he started interviewing various assistant district attorneys who had received the questionnaire, and he wasn't interested in interviewing them as to whether Sheila Myers was refusing to transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.653" offset="8600567">He was interested in the content of the questionnaire.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.948" offset="8613733">In fact, he interviewed one district attorney... his name is Fred Ours, who was from Section I, that is, the section of court to which Ms. Myers was to be transferred, who had talked with Ms. Myers only that morning about how they were going to split up the work in Section I, but Mr. Connick wasn't interested in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.657" offset="8708505">He was interested on the questionnaire.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.795" offset="8725119">So, the district court's finding that not only had there not been a refusal to accept the transfer, but also that Mr. Connick didn't believe there had been a refusal, is also well supported in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.104" offset="8778304">It is a finding with regard to motivation which this Court in Pullman Standard versus Swint last term found is a fact to which Rule 52(a) applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.440" offset="8823653">Since the Petitioner cannot really do anything with those facts, he urges this Court to hold as a matter of law that the content of this questionnaire was so totally devoid of value as to be per se unfit for protection under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.575" offset="8912156">In effect, what he is saying is that the district court erred in even applying Pickering at all, because the questionnaire falls within one of those narrow kinds of speech which this Court has found is outside the scope of the First Amendment to begin with.</text>

            <text syncTime="3279.519" offset="13268022">That was a finding of fact made by the district judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.537" offset="13280038">I think that this... the context in which this has to be reviewed, Your Honor, is the fact that Mr. Connick also testified that complaints about transfers, internal complaints to him about transfers were very common, and that while he didn't think they were negotiable, at the same time he didn't... indeed, put very little weight on the fact that DA's frequently complained about going one place or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.289" offset="13411068">In fact, he testified that on occasion he had allowed Ms. Myers on an earlier occasion to talk him out of being transferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.410" offset="13447535">So, the finding that Mr. Connick thought it was acceptable that she said she was going to consider it is certainly not only supported in the record but it is understandable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.341" offset="13487242">I think the important point, though, is the district court found that Mr. Connick did not fire Ms. Myers or discharge her because he believed she was refusing the transfer.</text>
