            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="9.312" offset="129486">Petitioner Larry Shepard owns a dump truck, and operates it in the San Diego area to haul materials to and from construction sites.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.149" offset="168879">Before 1977, he wasn't a member of any union.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.872" offset="183717">In 1977, the respondent in this case, Teamsters Local 36, entered into a new contract with local contractors which prohibited hiring nonunion truckers.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.501" offset="230215">Shepard was told he would have to join the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.573" offset="242544">He joined under protest and paid an initiation fee and dues.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.910" offset="259890">He then filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.976" offset="276190">The Board found that the contract was illegal under the provision of the National Labor Relations Act that prohibits so-called ?hot cargo? contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.159" offset="312866">The Board ordered the union and contractors to stop enforcing the contract but it did not order them to reimburse Shepard for the money he had paid the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.358" offset="349646">Shepard petitioned for review in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit which agreed with the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.319" offset="373470">We granted Shepard's petition for a writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.729" offset="391129">Congress has given the Board authority to determine when a particular remedy would effectuate the policies of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.192" offset="421013">Because the Board has special expertise in this area, we understand the Board to have decided to order reimbursement only in especially serious situations where a union uses threats, picketing, a strike, or other actual coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.761" offset="483289">No such tactics were used in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.026" offset="496350">Shepard argues that the Board should give him what he calls ?complete relief?.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.028" offset="520383">But the Board is not a court created to resolve private disputes, it's an administrative agency responsible for the federal labor laws and for stopping and preventing unfair labor practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.521" offset="566358">Congress did not authorize the Board to award full compensation for all injuries caused by wrongful conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.380" offset="593735">Since nothing in the Act requires the Board to order that a complaining -- what a complaining party thinks is complete relief, we find that the Board was within its authority in refusing to order reimbursement.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.072" offset="640546">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.505" offset="654234">Justice O'Connor has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
