            <label>Mr. James P. Watson</label>
            <text syncTime="72.196" offset="438686">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.583" offset="468257">The question before the Court in this case is whether allegations set forth in a complaint filed by two regional labor organizations states a claim for relief under Section 1 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.991" offset="513919">For simplicity this morning I will refer to these two labor organizations jointly as "the union".</text>
            <text syncTime="96.562" offset="536175">The union alleges generally that it has been a party for over 25 years to collective bargaining agreements with defendant Associated General Contractors of California and its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.102" offset="582360">I shall refer to the association this morning as AGC&gt; ["], for short.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.256" offset="598974">In paragraph 23 of its amended complaint the union charges that AGC and its members entered into a conspiracy to undermine, weaken, and destroy the collective bargaining relationship between AGC and the union by engaging in a series of acts described in paragraph 24 of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.420" offset="683610">The union also alleges in the second count of its complaint that the same acts constituted breaches of the collective bargaining agreements between the union and AGC.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.644" offset="728541">AGC filed motions to dismiss and for summary judgment in the U.S. District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.179" offset="750693">The District Court ordered the antitrust claim dismissed, finding the union's claim was essentially a labor dispute for which the union had remedies under its collective bargaining agreement through arbitration and potentially through the NLRB.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.272" offset="807013">In reversing the District Court, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals focused on two allegations set forth in paragraph 24 of the complaint, which the Ninth Circuit felt stated the claim authorizing the District Court to scrutinize the activity of AGC under Section 1 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.251" offset="874931">Those allegations appear in subparagraphs (3) and (4) of paragraph 24.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.554" offset="896143">Paragraph 24(3) alleges that AGC and its members encouraged and induced others not to sign a collective bargaining agreement with the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.076" offset="934281">Paragraph 24(4) alleges that AGC and its members encouraged, aided, and coerced persons who let construction contracts to award them to persons not party to collective bargaining agreements with the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.086" offset="994259">The Ninth Circuit found that these allegations stated virtually the obverse of the situation treated by the Court in Connell Construction Company v. Plumbers and Steamfitters Local 100.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.394" offset="1039503">In the Connell case this Court held that an agreement between a union and a contractor with which the union had no collective bargaining relationship was subject potentially to scrutiny under the Sherman Antitrust Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.718" offset="1092792">The Ninth Circuit apparently believed that the Connell analysis would apply in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.355" offset="1111392">We believe the Ninth Circuit is mistaken in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.557" offset="1124139">We believe Connell is a far different decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.593" offset="1136260">There are, at a minimum, the following four distinctive features about this case that did not exist in Connell:</text>
            <text syncTime="253.747" offset="1164890">First, here, unlike Connell, there is a collective bargaining relationship between the union and the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.853" offset="1193312">Labor remedies are available under that collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.488" offset="1207836">Second, in Connell, it was clear the union could not claim a statutory labor exemption under the Clayton and Norris-LaGuardia Acts because it was combined with a nonlabor party; namely, Connell Construction Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.445" offset="1259663">Under Allen Bradley it is clear the exemption is forfeited when a union combines with a nonunion party.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.432" offset="1283695">Here, by contrast, only unilateral activity on the part of management is involved and alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.538" offset="1312117">Third, in Connell it was clear that the union had the power to shut any contractor out of the market for bidding on jobs with Connell and any other similar contractor that signed such an agreement with the union simply by refusing to sign a collective bargaining agreement with that company.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.249" offset="1382961">If there was no collective bargaining agreement, then Connell, under the terms of its agreement with the union, could not use that company as a subcontractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.237" offset="1414830">Here there is no allegation that AGC has any similar power to foreclose union companies from bidding on the construction projects of letters of construction contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.795" offset="1453073">There is, therefore, no direct market restraint of the type evident in Connell.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.913" offset="1473553">Finally, as this Court noted last term in Wolfe and Romero, Connell appears to be a very limited holding which applied an antitrust remedy in a situation arising under Section 8(e) of the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 and its additions to the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.910" offset="1549517">Relying on the fact that the legislative history of the Act, passed in 1959, indicated no inclination on the part of Congress not to permit application of the antitrust laws, the Court found scrutiny of the conduct in Connell to be subject to antitrust analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.805" offset="1621197">However, the Court was clear in pointing out in that decision that the earlier labor legislation, the Taft-Hartley Act, did contain legislative statements indicating a desire not to apply the antitrust laws to the broader proscriptions contained in those acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.084" offset="1690265">In this case, the solicitor general argues that the allegations of paragraph 24(4) of the complaint state the elements of a classic boycott in the antitrust sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.057" offset="1738121">We believe this reasoning is faulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.593" offset="1748257">First, it seems apparent that the solicitor general accepted the Ninth Circuit's characterization of the complaint in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.330" offset="1775215">And I feel impelled at this point to detour just for a moment to comment on that because the Ninth Circuit opinion contains some statements about what the complaint alleges which appear to me to be at variance with the contents of the complaint itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.340" offset="1831326">First, the Ninth Circuit twice states in its opinion that AGC and its members attempted to coerce letters of construction contracts to award such contracts only to nonunion subcontractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.164" offset="1886601">There is no such allegation in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.682" offset="1896632">The word "only" does not appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.901" offset="1905514">Nor could there truthfully be such an allegation, since it would mean that AGC and its unionized members were conspiring to shut themselves out of the market entirely on construction contracts.</text>

            <text syncTime="475.307" offset="2051173">All right.</text>

          <turn speaker="james_p_watson" startTime="476.343" stopTime="511.080">
            <label>Mr. James P. Watson</label>
            <text syncTime="476.343" offset="2055352">The second matter in which we believe the Ninth Circuit has inaccurately characterized the complaint is in asserting that the complaint claims a boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.365" offset="2091401">That word also does not appear in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.651" offset="2100492">But it appears three times in the Ninth Circuit's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.769" offset="2113031">Finally, the Ninth Circuit asserts that there is an effective lockout of union subcontractors being carried out here by AGC and AGC is attempting to totally shut out union subcontractors from work awarded by certain letters of construction contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.712" offset="2180740">Again, that allegation does not appear anywhere in the complaint.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="511.080" stopTime="514.984">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="511.080" offset="2194219">From which part of the complaint were you reading, Counsel?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_p_watson" startTime="514.984" stopTime="1043.576">
            <label>Mr. James P. Watson</label>
            <text syncTime="514.984" offset="2209893">The part I was reading from, Your Honor, is paragraph 24, and particularly subparagraphs (3), (4), and (5).</text>
            <text syncTime="521.371" offset="2235388">Those are the paragraphs that the Ninth Circuit focused on.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.240" offset="2250853">They are in Appendix E to the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.775" offset="2260988">So we believe the solicitor general has fundamentally erred in the way that it has characterized the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.083" offset="2310308">Second, the mere fact that something which is called a "boycott" might exist does not automatically turn every situation in which such facts exist into an antitrust claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.807" offset="2357119">At the end of last term, in NAACP v. Claiborne, this Court found a noncommercial boycott not be actionable under Mississippi law.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.829" offset="2393272">That concededly was not a case which dealt with the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.198" offset="2406752">Rather, Mississippi's antitrust statute and common law theories of interference with contractual relations were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.369" offset="2431411">Nevertheless, the point seems clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.487" offset="2439875">It is underscored by much earlier decision of this Court in Hunt v. Crumboch, issued the same year as Allen Bradley, 1945, in which the Court, through Mr. Justice Black, made it clear that labor disputes ordinarily are not the subject of antitrust scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.914" offset="2501628">In that case, the labor union refused to permit anyone to join it, thereby boycotting those people who worked for a certain contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.502" offset="2531930">Despite the fact that boycott analysis would ordinarily apply to such allegations, the Court refused to find a claim under the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.192" offset="2562650">Recently, in an opinion which is referred to with apparent approval by this Court in its Claiborne decision, State of Missouri v. National Organization of Women, the Eight Circuit extensively analyzed the legislative history of the Sherman Act and concluded that the commercial types of restraints at which the Sherman Act was directed did not include political types of activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.606" offset="2648332">We believe the same type of analysis applies in this case, and it is exemplified, of course, in the statutory exemptions contained in the Clayton and Norris-LaGuardia Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.211" offset="2686784">The solicitor general states at page 9 of his brief that if unionized contractors do not receive least some construction contracts, perforce they have been shut out of a portion of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.102" offset="2734327">And with all respect, we believe this to be circular reasoning as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.821" offset="2749165">The test is not whether unionized subcontractors receive contracts from letters of construction contracts, but whether they were at least considered for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.677" offset="2784587">Moreover, the fact that a unionized contractor may not get all contracts, may only get a portion of them, certainly does not indicate that he is being boycotted.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.885" offset="2821472">We also believe this Court's decisions in Apex Hosiery v. Leader and Hunt v. Crumboch make it clear that labor disputes are not ordinarily grist for the antitrust mill.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.156" offset="2866507">And taking their lead from these two decisions, many lower courts have followed that reasoning in recent years.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.679" offset="2892629">In the J.B. Stevens case, the Prepmore case, and the Kennedy case, which are all cited in our brief, follow essentially that line of reasoning in refusing to permit labor unions to assert antitrust claims against employers and employers associations who have acted antagonistically against them, at least where there is a collective bargaining relationship between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.391" offset="2971519">Now, the solicitor general seems to agree that some unilateral employer conduct is exempt from scrutiny under the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.561" offset="3004224">But he suggests the exemption is lost when third parties are affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.031" offset="3022092">And he points out here that there are third parties in the form of letters of construction contracts and unionized contractors not members of AGC who might be affected by any activity that the multi-employer association takes.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.124" offset="3078412">And we think there are three things wrong with this analysis:</text>
            <text syncTime="734.910" offset="3089592">First, the labor exemption has been applied time and time again in cases where third parties are affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.480" offset="3115819">The United States v. Hutcheson, the case which applied the Norris-LaGuardia Acts, exemptions from the antitrust laws was a dispute between two unions, where, in fact, the whole dispute was fought out on the property of a third party, Anheuser-Busch.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.739" offset="3172871">The Jacksonville Bulk Terminals, a case decided by this Court last year, which was a protest against Soviet foreign policy, obviously affected the employer whose goods were not being loaded onto the ships by the striking union.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.964" offset="3225743">In Apex Hosiery there was a violent sit-down strike conducted by the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.535" offset="3244028">Many parties were directly and indirectly affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.237" offset="3254895">Nevertheless, because there was a labor dispute rather than a dispute in a commercial context, this Court refused to apply the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.141" offset="3286451">Second, it is an economic reality of life that third parties will be affected by the unilateral labor activity of both management and unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.663" offset="3320619">That is inescapable.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.830" offset="3325217">And the labor laws attempt to deal with that in many ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.983" offset="3337860">Section 8(b)(4)(b) of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.102" offset="3350294">Section 303 of the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act provide remedies for certain limited kinds of impermissible secondary conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.708" offset="3388747">If those remedies are inadequate, the appropriate approach is to amend the labor laws, not to try and pull off from some other branch of federal regulation into the labor context.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.766" offset="3432946">Third, because of the two unique mechanisms available in the construction industry, the issue of just how much any unionized third party might be affected here is very speculative.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.407" offset="3479548">This Court noted five years ago in the Higdon decision that a pre-hire labor agreement, which is specifically authorized in the construction industry by Section 8(f) of the National Labor Relations Act, is an agreement which may be repudiated by a construction contractor at any time before the union demonstrates majority representation in the contractor's work force.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.653" offset="3568574">That means that where there has been no such demonstration, any construction contractor signed to such a pre-hire agreement can disavow the agreement and not be bound by it from that moment on.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.128" offset="3610474">Second, as noted in the amicus brief of the Chamber of Commerce, it is a common practice in this day and age, and one which in appropriate circumstances passes legal muster before the NLRB, for contractors to create so-called double-breasted businesses; that is, businesses which may consist of a separate corporation which is union and a separate corporation which is nonunion.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.208" offset="3702739">If the same ownership exists of the two businesses, economic benefit flows to the ultimate owner regardless of whether contracts are performed by the union or nonunion business.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.349" offset="3743281">So it is not at all clear that a unionized contractor is going to be shut out of the market if an owner or letter of construction contracts says, I want this work performed nonunion.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.940" offset="3789674">Interestingly, respondent admits this in his brief on page 49, where he states that one reason the union should bring this action is because contractors may not do so simply because they may have the option of going double-breasted.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.166" offset="3846621">By saying that, it seems to me the Respondent has admitted there is a very real question here about the way the Ninth Circuit approached this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.337" offset="3875251">The Ninth Circuit said, we must have an antitrust claim here because third parties are affected and the union can recover its incidental damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.843" offset="3905344">The union says, one reason we should be permitted to do that is because the party against whom the antitrust conspiracy is aimed may not be damaged at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.180" offset="3938677">We also believe this case is not properly maintainable as an antitrust case because the result it seeks is not consonant with the purpose of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.571" offset="3984234">In Brunswick Corporation v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat this Court held that antitrust laws are designed to protect competition, not competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.445" offset="4023731">In this case the union seeks to collect damages stemming from a decline in its power to effectively represent carpenters occasioned by AGC's encouragement of the proliferation of open-shop contracting.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.936" offset="4073677">In other words, as in Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, the plaintiff wants nonunion competitors out of the market in order to preserve the market for unionized businesses, unionized carpenters, and ultimately to the benefit of the union itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.578" offset="4128221">Again as the amici have pointed out, there is much to be said in terms of preserving competition for permitting a market where both union and nonunion contractors compete for construction contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.301" offset="4175137">I will not take the time because of the limitations of this argument to discuss the application of the statutory labor exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.593" offset="4212335">That point is briefed in detail in both my brief and the brief of the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.128" offset="4230412">And the legislative history is set forth there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.997" offset="4237935">I will note, however, that last term, in Jacksonville Bulk Terminals this Court held again as it has in the past that the term "labor dispute" as it is used in the Norris-LaGuardia Act has a naturally broad meaning and may apply to disputes where third parties are involved and may even apply to disputes where motives other than the economic motive are involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="1068.811" offset="4425181">Last term, in Blue Shield of Virginia v. McCready this Court addressed the standing issue under Section 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.048" offset="4454125">In granting standing to an injured consumer who had been denied reimbursement of her billings by a psychologist for psychological services, the Court appeared to emphasize three factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.307" offset="4507205">One was the need to identify those who possess standing by using proximate cause analysis similar to that used in tort law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.811" offset="4541165">Second, the Court made specific note of the ascertain ability of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.115" offset="4562376">In McCready it was quite clear that the plaintiff was damaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.901" offset="4573557">It was very easy to figure out what the damages were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.686" offset="4580662">She had the unpaid bill, and it showed right on the bill how much it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.071" offset="4594245">Third, the Court indicated, as it had previously in Reiter v. Sonotone that there was a specific congressional intent to vindicate consumer rights under the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.945" offset="4637713">None of these factors are present in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1183.084" offset="4882219">The damages here are far more speculative than they are in McCready.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.388" offset="4899460">The damage assumption rests on the presumption that the union will lose revenues, lost dues, because members will drop out if they are hired by open-shop contractors or work shifts for the open-shop sector of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.879" offset="4953481">First, it is by no means clear that open-shop contractors will refuse to hire unionized workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.901" offset="4985560">In fact, it is an unfair labor practice for them to inquire about the union affiliation of their workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.872" offset="5005413">Second, it is by no means clear that a unionized carpenter who goes to work for an open-shop contractor will not maintain his union membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.942" offset="5033730">Work in the construction industry is seasonal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.578" offset="5044283">He may well want to go back to work for a unionized contractor on the next job he gets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.382" offset="5063509">So it is a matter of speculation to assume because open-shop contractors get some jobs, that there is going to be any massive shift of carpenters away from union affiliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.571" offset="5104260">Finally, I should note that the proximate cause analysis, which the Court adverted to in the McCready case, would have to be applied in this case in a much more attenuated fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.663" offset="5168626">The union is three or four steps, at a minimum, removed from the situs of the damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.234" offset="5186912">In McCready it was very clear that the consumer herself was extremely directly damaged, and she could not get her medical bill paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.904" offset="5213557">Multi-employer collective bargaining has been recognized by this Court, most recently in Charles Bonanno Linen but also in Buffalo Linen, to serve a very real purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.196" offset="5258696">If the concerted acts of a multi-employer association and its members in formulating labor policies... and those policies by definition will always in some sense be antagonistic to those of the union... can be subject to antitrust analysis every time the union is unhappy with those situations, then a remedy unanticipated by Congress when it set up the labor laws will be injected in a very delicate area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.161" offset="5358588">There are sensible reasons why unionized contractors, including those who want to remain unionized, would want to encourage a certain amount of work to go to open-shop contractors, even if it means they lose that work.</text>

            <text syncTime="1405.229" offset="5770801">And given that circumstance, it seems to me it is within the Court's province to say we do not want to put the parties to the expense of attempting to litigate this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.984" offset="5805909">If I understand the Court's holding in Illinois Brick correctly, the holding amounts to a concern by this Court over whether the expenses of litigation of attenuated chains of proof are going to outweigh any possible benefit either to the litigants or the public.</text>

            <text syncTime="1699.969" offset="6949759">--As an 8(a)(5), as an 8(a)(5), assuming that the contractor has entered into a collective bargaining relationship with the union and then seeks to avoid the collective bargaining relationship by developing a sham entity or a double-breast, as we refer to it, and that we file a charge under Section 8(a)(5) to allege, in essence, an attempt to run away from an agreement, a runaway shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.536" offset="7052054">As a theoretical matter, yes, that could be done on a contractor-by-contractor basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.840" offset="7073266">As a practical matter, it simply is not done because the board has said that that is really not a remedy for a double-breast.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.577" offset="7104195">And in essence, if one deals with the reality of the work place, what happens is that a contractor, particularly when viewed in the context of this Court's decision in Higdon changes his name or its name for every job, sometimes changes his name or entity or style of doing business on various sections of the same job and joins an association, becomes signatory to the contract, the day after the contract is signed, moves over to the so-called open-shop division of that association and becomes free of the collective bargaining agreement because of the notion, specifically discussed by this Court in Connell, that there is a statutory scheme that there should be no top-down organizing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.408" offset="7295516">So even if we want to deal with the reality of what this Court dealt with in Connell, the answer, Your Honor, to the question posed was that there is no practical remedy under 8(a)(5).</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.049" offset="7342118">That is why it is essential that this Court understand the distinction posed by the Court below in treating this as an antitrust case and not as a labor case in my standing here before you and arguing this to be an antitrust case and not a labor case when I would dearly love to argue with you concerning the policy questions of Connell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.815" offset="7433233">But for purposes of this case, it has to be accepted and understood that we are dealing indeed with the obverse of Connell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.854" offset="7469387">This is not a labor case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.639" offset="7476492">The only way in which petitioner can prevail is to place this case in the context of a labor case and have this Court agree that it is a labor case and not an antitrust case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.862" offset="7525393">So let's look at the two beacon lights which this Court focused in Connell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.600" offset="7552352">Number one, it said, even though counsel states that it is to be narrowly construed... that is, Connell... this Court states that there must be a stranger relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.174" offset="7602611">Local 100 signed an agreement with Connell after putting economic pressure on Connell at a time when it thought that it was protected by Section 8(e) of the act in doing what it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.833" offset="7657259">But assuming it was not, assuming the conduct was proscribed by Section 8(b)(4), regulated by Taft-Hartley, subject to the filing of a charge under Section 8(b)(4), subject after a hearing before the board to a collateral estoppel argument in a damage action under Section 3, subject to a 303 action for what it did, what Local 100 did, notwithstanding a regulatory statutory scheme, notwithstanding a statutory provision that says that you can get damages for such conduct, which is 8(b)(4), secondary-boycott conduct, notwithstanding the fact that after the passage of Norris-LaGuardia, Congress gave United States District Courts the authority under Section 10(1) for that same conduct, to obtain an injunction against the proscribed conduct, pendente lite.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.587" offset="7884316">So a full and comprehensive scheme of regulation damages and injunctive relief, this Court still held that even though it was clear-cut 8(b)(4), 10(1), 303 action, we shine the light on, the beacon on, the fact that in addition to being proscribed by Taft-Hartley, you Local 100 committed a violation of antitrust, subjecting you to treble damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.860" offset="8025377">Standing was not even argued in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.062" offset="8038229">It was assumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.845" offset="8041259">And it was assumed because of a built-in prejudice in the kind of plaintiff we have: if it is an employer, the damages are assumed not to be speculative; if it is a union, it is assumed to be speculative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.120" offset="8094445">What was the second beacon light of this Court in Connell?</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.357" offset="8111372">It was, in fact, that the action, the conduct of Local 100 was designed to prohibit the employment of nonunion contractors, which this Court stated was exclusionary on a nondiscriminatory basis and, therefore, anticompetitive, i.e., if you have two nonunion contractors and one of them is efficient and one of them is inefficient, and you exclude them both, including the efficient one, this Court stated that that nondiscriminate exclusion regardless of efficiency, which incidentally was outside the record of that case, constituted the second beacon light.</text>

            <text syncTime="2066.172" offset="8414601">We have a stranger relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.724" offset="8424841">The question was asked, and counsel stated that all of the parties are reachable under the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.313" offset="8455143">That is absolutely not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.331" offset="8463294">The owner of land, the major industrialist, the member of the Roundtable who determines that there should be a "union-free environment", says that when I build my plant, when I build my refinery, when I build my chemical factory, you contractor will be nonunion and you will see to it that you and your other contractors who do work on this project will be nonunion, and we form a tripartite conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.271" offset="8615013">A tripartite conspiracy to do what?</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.324" offset="8635179">Again, the Connell beacon light shines and finds what?</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.793" offset="8649077">To exclude on a nondiscriminate basis, regardless of efficiency or nonefficiency, all of those contractors who have a union contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.434" offset="8691708">If you could find that it was an antitrust case in Connell because of those two beacon lights, stranger and nondiscriminate exclusion, you cannot avoid the conclusion here, because without regard to whether the contractor is the single lowest bidder, the single most efficient contractor on the whole project, because he has or it has a collective bargaining relationship with the union, it is therefore excluded under what we have alleged in the complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="2180.780" offset="8872998">Number one, Your Honor, I think you would have to presume the facts to be tried at a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.017" offset="8894001">We are here on the pleadings and the facts pleaded therefore have to be assumed to be correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.969" offset="8909779">But quite the contrary happens everyday in the real world; that is, that the union contractor, precisely because he has highly skilled workers, they are more efficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.711" offset="8956799">They may get a higher hourly wage rate than a nonunion contractor, but he will do the job cheaper and he will do it more efficiently.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.466" offset="8983757">And day by day all over the country, particularly in our area, the low bidder in the field of contractors, union and nonunion, are union contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.672" offset="9024613">So that assumption, in all due respect, Your Honor, is not one that can be assumed as a matter of law, as a matter of fact, or as a matter of reality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.511" offset="9059930">Now, to continue with the aspect of why we feel Connell requires a decision in our favor in this case, and why the Ninth Circuit used Connell as the sole basis of its decision, is that this Court did something brand-new in a sense in Connell.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.626" offset="9148433">Previously... and this directly contradicts petitioner's attempt to make it into a labor case... previously, at least since 1947, since the Taft-Hartley Amendments, the proviso requiring federal preemption, which was decided by this Court in Garman, Guss and Fairlong, and Garner, was specifically held to apply to antitrust cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.027" offset="9262014">This Court's decision in Teamsters v. Oliver dealt with the Ohio antitrust statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.649" offset="9292525">This Court held that Taft-Hartley preempts any remedy, injunctive or by way of damages in an antitrust action in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.905" offset="9329514">In Connell you specifically dealt with that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.107" offset="9342366">You referred to Oliver, as I recall, in the text towards the end of the decision and also in a footnote, and stated, very simply, that it is true that in the antitrust statute alleged in Connell, if we can recall, that case was originally filed under the Texas antitrust statute, was removed to the United States District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.240" offset="9438915">An amendment to the complaint stated a claim under the Sherman Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2356.229" offset="9574856">And I specifically state it that way and characterize it that way because the Connell conduct would have been lawful and fully protected by Section 7 of the Waggoner Act, still Section 7 of the Labor Management Relations Act because Section 8(b), declaring the conduct of secondary boycott and indeed the type of conduct as we had in Hutchinson a jurisdictional dispute, was protected activity or at least not prohibited until 1947; that is, the for the twelve-year period between 1935 and 1947.</text>

            <text syncTime="2948.809" offset="11945207">Let's take the context of this case and remember where it came from, because it started in 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.648" offset="11976554">This is the second 1975 case you have this morning.</text>

            <text syncTime="2964.552" offset="12008110">During its pendency before the United States District Court Connell came down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.472" offset="12039770">We were asked to brief Connell.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.658" offset="12052518">The district judge then found that Connell was inapplicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.430" offset="12083656">It was appealed on that ground to the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.215" offset="12098807">It's as much a mystery to me as to everybody else why it took so long to proceed, but it did.</text>

            <text syncTime="3003.593" offset="12164322">And what we are here arguing is is that there is a direct opposite, that there are two faces to the coin; that if Connell stands, which it must because no one in this case has asked that it be reversed, and no one in this case has tackled the policy arguments of Connell.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.923" offset="12249586">We did not raise Higdon; counsel raised Higdon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.292" offset="12263065">Higdon and Connell taken together with the 1959 amendments to Taft-Hartley... that is, Title VII of the Landram-Griffin Act... place us in a totally different position from that in which we have been before as labor organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.254" offset="12326908">If we can be sued and pay out of our treasury when the Connell beacon shines on us, but we have no standing because we have no property or the link in the chain is too remote for us, therefore, to be plaintiffs, and we can never on the exact observe, on the exact reverse, on the exact same fact situation, but here the contractors are the defendants, and we're the plaintiffs versus the Connell situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.039" offset="12454072">If we do not have a remedy, you have not carried forward the purpose which you stated you were carrying forward in Connell.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.462" offset="12483748">You justified Connell... Connell was a departure... you justified Connell on the basis that you were balancing the interests between labor laws and antitrust laws in that area where they meshed and where the ground was soft.</text>

            <label>Mr. James P. Watson</label>
            <text syncTime="3555.650" offset="14372505">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.445" offset="14375744">Or really I should say two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.055" offset="14382118">First, if I might just briefly, counsel had indicated that there was no adequate remedy under the labor laws for the kind of double-breasted problem that occurs when a contractor opens an open shop and maintains a union shop business at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.845" offset="14453276">In fact, there is a whole string of NLRB cases on this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.092" offset="14470308">They are on pages 66 and 67 of the record transmitted to this Court by the U.S. Court of Appeals, cases such as Shultz Painting, which is at 202 NLRB No. 23; Milo Express at 212 NLRB No. 57, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.569" offset="14540211">Second, in the time remaining let me comment on Connell because it seems to me that the whole thrust of the plaintiff's contention here is that Connell mandates this kind of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.860" offset="14581380">First, as I pointed out in my opening argument, there was a mechanism in Connell which is absent here, and that was the power of the union to literally lock contractors out of the market with Connell and any other stranger contractor it could get to sign one of these agreements with it that they would not subcontract to anyone not party to an agreement with the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.148" offset="14674481">Here there is no allegation in the complaint, no mechanism alleged that would lead to any inference that AGC has such a power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.786" offset="14705096">Second, the Court specifically emphasized in Connell that it was engaging in a rather narrow exception to the general rule about preemption by the labor laws of antitrust claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.469" offset="14763819">Specifically, the Court relied on the fact that when Section 8(E) was enacted in 1959 there was no legislative history to indicate that Congress wanted 8(E) violations not to be redressed under the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.509" offset="14815960">The Court made specific reference at that time to the fact that the opposite was the case with regard to the Taft-Hartley Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3673.427" offset="14843650">Now, it seems to me as discussed in my opening argument Connell is clearly distinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3679.646" offset="14868518">Finally, finally in Connell the Court says in a footnote that where a party has two consistent remedies under federal law, he may have a choice of remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3691.719" offset="14916792">Now, whether the Court in fact in Connell considered whether the remedies were consistent or not, it is clear here, I think, for the reasons set forth in my brief by no stretch of the imagination are the remedies consistent between arbitration grievance processing, NLRB grievance processing... both of which are basically make whole type remedies... and the type of remedy which would be available in an antitrust action where treble damages and attorneys' fees would come down on the heads of all the losing defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.752" offset="15028910">So for those reasons I don't think Connell creates authority for this kind of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3724.252" offset="15046987">Finally, I would urge the Court to read the complaint carefully.</text>
            <text syncTime="3727.423" offset="15059630">We are here only to test the allegations of this complaint, not matters outside the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3732.968" offset="15081782">And there have been some statements made in counsel's argument, specifically statements about conspiracies with letters of contracts as opposed to conspiracies among the membership to encourage and induce letters of contracts which do not appear in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.241" offset="15146879">I am not contending that it would not be possible for Mr. Van Bourg or his clients to concoct some kind of potential antitrust theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3757.442" offset="15179689">What I do contend is that this complaint by its words does not state an antitrust claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3762.737" offset="15200900">It is purely and simply a labor grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3765.438" offset="15211663">I thank you.</text>
