            <label>Mr. Jerrold J. Ganzfried</label>
            <text syncTime="61.101" offset="396953">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case concerns the role of the Comptroller General in government procurement, specifically his statutory right to access to records of government contractors... books and records.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.095" offset="448884">To put the access provisions in context, it must be recalled that when Congress created the GAO in 1921, it directed that the Comptroller investigate all matters relating to the receipt, disbursement and application of public funds, and further directed the Comptroller to make recommendations to Congress looking for greater economy or efficiency in public expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.430" offset="550239">Under that mandate, the Comptroller has, for sixty years, examined the fiscal responsibility and the manner in which federal agencies have discharged their fiscal responsibilities, with an eye towards increasing efficiency and promoting economy in the expenditure of public funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.108" offset="628920">There should be no doubt that this is precisely the function Congress assigned to the GAO when it included the word 1921 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.010" offset="672492">Congressman Lutes, who proposed that addition, stated that its purpose is to make sure that the Comptroller General shall concern himself not simply with taking in and paying out of money from an accountant's point of view, but that he shall also concern himself with the question as to whether it is economically and efficiently applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.611" offset="754935">Now following World War II, Congress recognized the explosive growth in purchases from the private sector required that the Comptroller be given additional powers so he could discharge these responsibilities properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.840" offset="807911">For this reason, Congress passed the access to records statutes at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.807" offset="831735">They gave the Comptroller access to records of government contractors so that he would have the necessary tool to examine the transactions from both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.553" offset="866739">This was based on Congress' determination that only with this full information could GAO discharge its duties in a meaningful way.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.783" offset="907594">And Congress focused special concern on negotiated contracts... those that were made without advertised solicitation of bids.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.358" offset="941971">Because negotiated contracts lack the inherent safeguards of advertised contracts, they are more susceptible to abuse and more likely to result in waste and extravagance.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.526" offset="990559">In a word, they pose a greater risk that the government will pay unreasonably high prices, and for that reason Congress determined that negotiated contracts require close supervision and control.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.833" offset="1039878">In fact, negotiated contracts were prohibited by law until World War II.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.955" offset="1060358">In this case, GAO seeks to exercise its statutory right of access to Merck's records relating to only four of the many negotiated contracts Merck has with the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.404" offset="1102154">The objective is to determine whether the procurement methods employed adequately protect the government's interest or whether more economical measures could be recommended.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.073" offset="1144786">To put the importance of this effort in perspective, we mention in our brief that in 1973 government expenses for prescription drugs totaled $1.6 billion, including $252 million in direct purchases.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.894" offset="1208107">In congressional hearings in 1981, it was estimated the total federal procurement, its aggregate, on pharmaceuticals had blossomed to $2.5 billion, or... that is, $2.5 billion per year, or some 25 percent of total industry sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.183" offset="1281250">So where you are dealing in the aggregate, with a major aspect of federal spending, where waste, if there is any, would be a serious drain on resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.071" offset="1316776">But the Court of Appeals' decision cripples GAO's ability to make a meaningful examination of procurement practices by limiting access to records of an estimated nine percent of Merck's costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.691" offset="1363274">The Court has prevented GAO from obtaining the bulk of the information it needs--</text>

            <text syncTime="1900.179" offset="7753243">This is a statutory construction case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.224" offset="7765364">The argument that has just been presented on behalf of the government emphasizes why the Comptroller General or his counsel today believes that it might be a fine idea for the Comptroller General to have access to the extensive cost records of government contractors, even where costs played no part in the negotiation or pricing of the contract for the goods sold to the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.823" offset="7875810">That position may make sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.086" offset="7888871">It may not make sense as a matter of policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.351" offset="7897857">I don't know what the right answer to that question is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.882" offset="7912068">All I know is that in 1972 before he was finally forced into pursuing this exercise, when, as the Third Circuit recently put it, he concluded... "he", the Comptroller General... that he had no viable option but to do what Senator Nelson had urged him, the Comptroller General personally testified before Senator Nelson's Committee that this very exercise would be, in his words, "a waste of time".</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.026" offset="8024603">And he said at that point... and the passage is quoted on pages three and four of our brief... that since the government always buys pharmaceutical products below the cost at which these products are sold in substantial quantities to the general public, he, as he put it,</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.487" offset="8102448">"found it a little hard on its face to say that the government is not getting good prices. "</text>

            <text syncTime="1998.123" offset="8144975">and then a Senator calls up the prosecutor and the prosecutor says,</text>

            <text syncTime="2009.274" offset="8189593">Justice Rehnquist, I think this case is a little bit different because we're talking here about the use of a coercive power given under a statute that we think was given by Congress for a very limited purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.379" offset="8237971">The purpose was, as the legislative history would show and I think the language of the statute would show, to allow the Comptroller General to conduct audits of individual contracts to see whether the parties on either side had abused the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.358" offset="8301919">The Comptroller General said that was not something that he thought he was interested in doing in this industry, or something that he thought would be useful.</text>

            <text syncTime="2112.874" offset="8603999">If the price of the contract had been negotiated on the basis of cost, because Merck represented that it would incur a certain level of costs in performing the contract, or if the contract price itself was left open to be based upon the costs actually incurred, then there is no question whatsoever that that would be within the traditional audit function that the Comptroller General has and that this access statute permits him to enforce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.878" offset="8716012">That, however, is not what we have here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.987" offset="8724476">I'm not sure whether Merck has any cost-plus contracts with the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.437" offset="8742239">I rather doubt that it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.156" offset="8749135">There is nothing in the record to indicate that there are any such contracts, and one would have thought that if there had been any the Comptroller General, knowing that this whole dispute concerned the industry's position that cost records are highly confidential and that they are not relevant to non-cost-based records, if the Comptroller knew of any such cost-based contracts in the industry he would have selected those as the predicate for his access demands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.535" offset="8858641">He didn't, and what we have here is an access demand that lists four specific, non-cost-based contracts, all of which the government admits are for standard commercial items sold to the general public at catalog prices or otherwise based on prices that are set in the competitive marketplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.950" offset="8940247">I might at this point pick up on one of the colloquies that was held during my colleague's discussion with the Court about whether the GAO has any belief or any suspicion that the prices for these contracts were not reasonable in any sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.533" offset="9030631">The GAO, when it answered interrogatories, expressly denied that it had any reason to suspect any impropriety in any part of the negotiation process or had any reason to doubt the reasonableness of the price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.137" offset="9089041">When the senior GAO official who is involved in this matter, Mr. Ahart, the Director of the Manpower and Welfare Division, was being deposed, I asked him the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.116" offset="9137002">Is there any specific reason to believe that Merck made excessive or unreasonable profits on any of the four contracts in question?</text>

            <text syncTime="2279.619" offset="9270958">The secret, Justice Stevens, is that the government wants not the records that Merck has offered, which are the records to show that the prices that were agreed upon in these contracts were actually based upon catalog prices at which these products were sold to the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.564" offset="9338771">They have said under this statute, which has, we think, not only limited language but a purpose, a background of legislative intent that shows a narrow range of authority, that they want access to all of Merck's cost records, except to the extent... and it's a little hard to pin down precisely what the theory is since it has shifted a bit... except to the extent, as we understand it... and this picks up on Justice... Judge Mikva's dissenting opinion in the lower court... that Merck bears the burden of showing that costs are specifically allocated by the company to some other product.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.172" offset="9497178">Now that's an interesting inversion of the statutory language, which says the Comptroller General may only get access to records that are directly pertinent to and involve transactions relating to a specific contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.151" offset="9557155">What that means, Justice Stevens, in this case is that since these clauses must be included in any contract for the purchase of more than $10,000 in goods, even for off-the-shelf kinds of standard commercial items, under the government's theory... and this is the way it has expressly articulated it again this afternoon... the government, through the GAO, is entitled to examine all of the costs that Merck has incurred for an indefinite period of time... Mr. Ahart said maybe as much as 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.808" offset="9699679">Merck, in a year in which these contracts were signed, had costs of about $1 billion, including about $100 million in research and development costs.</text>

            <text syncTime="2432.791" offset="9883686">Well, what we would do on a cooperative basis, Justice Stevens, is another matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.430" offset="9898210">As you know from looking at the record here, Merck was one of the companies that came forward voluntarily when GAO was interested in doing an economic study and we said we will give you access to a lot of information if you'll keep it confidential.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.626" offset="9959023">The record makes perfectly clear, as every court that has addressed this question has recognized, that the GAO said it was prepared to give the industry this kind of commitment of confidentiality for some of the reasons that emerged in the Chief Justice's colloquy with opposing counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.323" offset="10025792">But Senator Nelson and his staff said we want you to get individual product cost information to give to us so that we can disclose it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2505.355" offset="10173958">When we filed the complaint, Justice Stevens, we said that the scope of the demand made by the Comptroller General proposed to injure Merck in two respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.461" offset="10210321">One was the danger to the confidentiality of this information, and it is highly important, as I think the Chief Justice's question suggested, whether competitors know how a particular pharmaceutical company is concentrating its research and development activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.094" offset="10280851">That is of enormous use.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.281" offset="10285658">Industrial intelligence is highly specialized in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.373" offset="10301958">But the other purpose that we said motivated the suit to block the sweeping access that was demanded was the sheer cost and burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.932" offset="10336231">This is not simply a counsel's flight of fancy or a parade of horribles constructed for litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.867" offset="10367996">The record shows that, as my opposed counsel said, one of the six companies on whom these demands were simultaneously served decided it would try to acquiesce rather than fight.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.142" offset="10417106">That was Hoffman-LaRoche.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.673" offset="10423167">It allowed access in July 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.718" offset="10443333">When I asked Mr. Ahart on deposition what was the status of that inquiry, he testified... and this can be found in the Joint Appendix... that the... a team of GAO auditors had been on site at Hoffman-LaRoche's headquarters for 15 months and were expected to be there a few more months.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.131" offset="10545002">It turned out that in July 1975, two years later, the team was still there, and after some of the lower courts began to rule that the GAO had overstepped its bounds, Hoffman-LaRoche finally said enough is enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.374" offset="10601949">That would appear on Joint Appendix 127-A, Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.466" offset="10626399">So what we have here is a demonstrated track record that if GAO has what it claims in this case it can send teams of accountants to live at the headquarters of a contractor, spend years there... far more than outside auditors find it necessary to spend time to do the annual certifications for the SEC.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.940" offset="10720231">I think that makes it perfectly evident that the position of contractors like Merck and the others that this demand is not only abstractly in excess of the GAO's legal authority but is in fact a real substantial threat to the company's functioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.978" offset="10804450">Now opposing counsel also said that we in our reply brief had mistakenly said that the GAO had opposed a confidentiality provision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.286" offset="10861606">In fact, I think the Court should be aware, looking at record reference 58, when Merck moved for the addition of confidentiality provisions to the judgment, a motion that was subsequently granted, the GAO opposed that motion, saying it was prepared to agree to confidentiality only if the District Court granted the full relief that the government had been seeking, but that since the District Court had allowed access only to direct production cost records the government thought that it should be under no obligation to preserve the confidentiality of those records.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.755" offset="11007473">So I refer the Court for this I think largely irrelevant dispute to record item 58.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.940" offset="11036208">The key point, though, in this case is that it's a statutory construction case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.625" offset="11058987">The statute printed in the government's certiorari petition has in it at least four explicit terms of limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.105" offset="11104962">Page two of the government's petition for certiorari says, in relevant part,</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.806" offset="11131712">"The Comptroller General and his representatives are entitled. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.381" offset="11149998">--first limitation...</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.256" offset="11157521">"until the expiration of three years after final payment to examine any books or papers. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.080" offset="11180822">--that is number two... "directly pertaining to"... number three... "and involved transactions relating to"... and then, number four... "the contract".</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.061" offset="11228783">In the clause that implements this statutory requirement, which is in the record and is also quoted in the government's answer to the complaint in the Joint Appendix, the government has refined that to make it clear that access is to be granted only to records that are directly pertinent to and involving transactions relating to this contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.051" offset="11320734">So if the English language means anything, it means that both the statutory grant of authority and the contract clause which implements the authority focus directly, narrowly, specifically on the transactions involving that contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.826" offset="11387816">That, we think, logically, naturally suggests that what the government is entitled to are records relating to the negotiation of the contract, the performance of the contract, and the support for payment under the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.555" offset="11446749">Other procurement statutes make that pattern manifest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.114" offset="11472975">We refer to three or four of them... the Renegotiation Act, the Truth in Negotiations Act, the agency access statute enacted in 1968 to give the agencies, as the Congress was told, the same power of access that the GAO had been given in 1951, and the cost account... the government cost accounting standards statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.761" offset="11563568">All of those are congressional manifestations of the view that where a product being sold to the government is a standard commercial item sold to the general public at a catalog price or in some other competitive setting, the government does not have any legitimate interest in knowing what the contractor's costs are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.534" offset="11646638">The government's interests, as the Comptroller General testified in 1972, are protected when the government is assured... and Merck is prepared to give these records to the GAO... that the price at which the government purchased the items was based on and not more than the catalog price at which the same products were sold to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.369" offset="11737962">We, both sides, exhaustively discussed the legislative history, what is suggested by the language of the statute and what the legislative history shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.565" offset="11794804">Ther has also been a debate about whether the GAO has consistently interpreted the statute since 1951 or whether, as several courts and commentators have said, at best it's interpretation is checkered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.404" offset="11850079">I think it is worthwhile, though, to see what the GAO told Congress it thought the statute meant when the amendment to the permanent procurement statutes in the fall of 1951 was being considered.</text>

            <text syncTime="2958.843" offset="11987901">The thrust of what I was suggesting a moment ago about how the language of the statute reads underlies what we think is the objection to the District Court's holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.559" offset="12030742">The District Court, as you know, held in this case... and we recognize that three circuits, at least... well, four circuits, including the Hewlett-Packard decision in the Ninth Circuit... have held that under this statutory authority the Comptroller General can get access to direct production costs, even for... under a non-cost-based contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.142" offset="12121021">Our view is that the proper reading of the statute is that no cost records are directly pertinent to a contract if the contract is not cost-based, either because there were no representations made about costs during the negotiation of the price or because the price itself does not vary with costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.806" offset="12199702">If there is to be a conclusion... and one cannot blink the fact that at least four circuits have held that some costs are directly pertinent, but they have drawn the line at direct production costs... if some costs are pertinent, then that seems to be, as these four courts have held, a reasonable place to draw the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.938" offset="12288205">But our submission this afternoon is that when you look at the terms of the statute, consider the purpose of the statute, which was to enable the GAO to see whether the contracting officers or the government or the sales agents for the suppliers had overstepped their bounds either by making false, inadvertently mistaken, or inaccurate predictions about cost, or whether the contracting officer from the government standpoint had neglected, as the GAO has found in some instances is the case, to ask for cost information when that information should have been provided, then that's the situation in which cost records may be pertinent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.232" offset="12469390">Otherwise, cost records are simply not directly pertinent and do not involve transactions relating to the contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="3121.136" offset="12636992">In fact, in one or two of the contracts this clause was not physically included, but we're not arguing that that has any legal significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.352" offset="12665935">Appropos of that point, though, the three or four circuits that have now concluded that the GAO's argument exceeds the statutory language have reasoned that not only is this in excess of what the statute provides but that because this authority comes in through a contract no government contractor could reasonably construe the language to be as broad as the government now argues it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.668" offset="12795189">I think it's relevant also in that connection to note that before this dispute arose the government had never, as far as we can tell, sought to obtain indirect cost information in connection with any non-cost-based contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="3436.731" offset="13899438">If you look at record reference 23 attached to the affidavits of Merck's general counsel, Mr. Banse, are copies of correspondence with the government on this very point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.697" offset="13943323">Various contracting officers said we'd like to know what your costs are for these pharmaceuticals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.694" offset="13963281">In every case Merck said these are confidential.</text>

            <label>Justice White</label>
            <text syncTime="3460.285" offset="13993687">And then the government didn't call your bluff.</text>

          <turn speaker="philip_a_lacovara" startTime="3463.174" stopTime="3716.478">
            <label>Mr. Philip A. Lacovara</label>
            <text syncTime="3463.174" offset="14005181">--That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.079" offset="14008838">Colonel Brafogel, in fact, who is in charge of all pharmaceutical procurement for the Defense Department, wrote back and said we recognize your industry position and we will not in the future ask for cost information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.294" offset="14057635">That's record reference 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.231" offset="14065472">So this matter was expressly thrashed out and the government decided it would rather buy at the price Mr. Staats said was protected because it was established in the marketplace rather than say we won't buy unless you give us your cost information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.271" offset="14129629">The government's theory, I suggest, has very little relationship to the language of the statute or any of the purposes that one could possibly glean from the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.092" offset="14188874">If any records are pertinent, then, as several courts have said, we can go no further than direct production costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.526" offset="14218654">But the notion that under this authority the government is entitled to demand access to what, from the Roche experience and the government's own articulation, might be billions of dollars worth of cost records because a contractor sold off the shelf a standard commercial item worth $10,000, that seems to have very little connection with the language of the statute or its purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.172" offset="14329204">I would also like to emphasize in my conclusion that despite the predictions that the heavens will fall unless the various Circuits are repudiated on this subject, this case is truly unprecedented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.526" offset="14390644">The government, as far as the record shows, has never obtained access to indirect cost records in connection with a cost... non-cost-based product.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.710" offset="14427320">Hewlitt-Packard only allowed access to direct production costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.848" offset="14443934">The amicus brief of the Aerospace Industries Association, whose members have $60 billion a year in government contracts, have said that in their experience the Comptroller General has never tried to get access to cost records under non-cost-based contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.122" offset="14516972">In this record, GAO first said it used its access authority to audit $800 million in contracts in 1974 and '75.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.868" offset="14555947">When we asked were any of these non-cost-based contracts, the answer came back, somewhat sheepishly, well, no, they were all cost-based.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.146" offset="14589070">So either accepting the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case or Merck's somewhat broader position would have no impact on the use of this statute as the GAO has actually asserted it over the past 30 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.623" offset="14662944">The same conclusion applies to the argument that this power can be used to conduct economic studies of industries in order to see how the procurement process is working.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.180" offset="14705263">When we asked have you ever used this power for that purpose, back came the answer, yes, on five occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.616" offset="14730967">But, as the record shows, when you look at each of those, they turned out to be individual contract audits of cost-based contracts or, in one instance, what the government refers to as the HY-80 steel plate industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.626" offset="14786974">The government was simply auditing a decision by the Navy Department to accept a contractor's representation that steel plates for nuclear submarines were commercial products.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.495" offset="14834517">There was no cost audit involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3673.229" offset="14845384">The Navy was properly chastised for having been gulled into thinking that nuclear submarine plates were consumer items.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.866" offset="14888015">That's the limit to which the Comptroller General has attempted to push this power in the last 31 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3691.504" offset="14918527">We think that's the most eloquent demonstration that this case is a regrettable sport because, as the Third Circuit said, after several years of trying to hold the line against Senator Nelson, the Comptroller General concluded he had no viable alternative but to push ahead.</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.902" offset="14992087">We ask, therefore, that the judgment either be affirmed or that summary judgment be granted for Merck.</text>
            <text syncTime="3714.946" offset="15012254">Thank you.</text>
