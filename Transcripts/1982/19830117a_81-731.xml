            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="125779">We will hear arguments next in Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corporation against Arkansas Public Service Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.575" offset="167993">Mr. Cabe, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

          <turn speaker="robert_d_cabe" startTime="79.842" stopTime="344.348">
            <label>Mr. Robert D. Cabe</label>
            <text syncTime="79.842" offset="445100">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="83.529" offset="459833">This case arises out of an attempt by the Arkansas Public Service Commission to regulate the wholesale sales of power and energy by Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corporation to its member cooperatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.570" offset="520019">This is an appeal from the decision of the Arkansas Supreme Court, affirming the PSC's assertion of jurisdiction over these wholesale rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.503" offset="555755">The facts of the case, while undisputed, are most important to a determination of the issues before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.548" offset="583967">AECC is a generation and transmission electric cooperative which makes no sales at retail to ultimate consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.684" offset="624509">It is engaged exclusively in sales at wholesale.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.355" offset="639137">Most of these sales are to its 17 members who are themselves local distribution cooperatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.540" offset="667872">The remainder of AECC sales are to other utilities which also generate, transmit and sell electricity in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.725" offset="708623">AECC's member cooperatives sell the energy they obtain to their customers, who are the ultimate consumers of the power.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.143" offset="746344">The retail rates and operations of the member cooperatives are fully regulated by the PSC.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.985" offset="773616">AECC is concededly subject to PSC jurisdiction for purposes other than regulation of wholesale rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.574" offset="812068">AECC's rates, including the ones at issue before the Court in this case, are established by AECC's board of directors which includes two representatives of each of the 17 local distribution cooperatives who are the members.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.741" offset="876643">Succinctly stated, AECC arranges for the power and energy necessary to supply the needs of its member cooperatives in the following manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.532" offset="919901">First, it owns and operates generating plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.515" offset="931813">Second, it contracts with three separate multi-state systems to buy energy when its facilities are insufficient to provide the needs or when it could even buy the power and energy more economically than it can generate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.867" offset="1001195">Third, because AECC has very limited transmission facilities, it arranges with these same three multi-state systems for dispatch and transmission on the part of the grid that is operated by each of these multi-state systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.250" offset="1074755">Pursuant to these arrangements, most of the output of the AECC generating plants is delivered to the grid.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.107" offset="1110177">AECC's member cooperatives then obtain from the grid the energy they need to serve their customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.917" offset="1141420">In fact, only about 10 percent of the energy which AECC sells to its member cooperatives is ever involved with transmission facilities actually owned by AECC.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.880" offset="1193247">The other 90 percent passes exclusively over the system or grid of the multi-state utilities with which it does business.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.189" offset="1222504">All of the systems which transmit energy for and sell energy to and buy energy from AECC have generating facilities both in Arkansas and in other states, and all of these generating facilities are tied into integrated systems among themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.760" offset="1300767">When energy is delivered by the grid to a local distribution cooperative, the amount of the energy can, of course, be metered and precisely measured.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.786" offset="1344861">However, the generating source of that energy may have been at any plant attached to that grid whether inside or outside Arkansas, whether belonging to AECC or belonging to the generating facility of one of the other multi-state systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.107" offset="1410168">The PSC in this case does not appear to seriously dispute the proposition that AECC sales are sales at wholesale in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.306" offset="1454994">The decisions in Attleboro and Colton make clear that the state is prohibited by the Commerce Clause from regulating sales at wholesale in interstate commerce.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert D. Cabe</label>
            <text syncTime="389.801" offset="1684976">Yes, that argument was raised in the briefs filed with the PSC when the matter was originally heard by the PSC at that stage of the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.171" offset="1722383">It was raised briefly in the briefs at the level of the Arkansas Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.621" offset="1748192">When we submitted our Jurisdictional Statement in this case, we relied exclusively on the Commerce Clause argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.634" offset="1772225">However, before probable jurisdiction was noted, the court invited the Solicitor General of the United States to state the views of the United States, and when the Solicitor General did so he employed a preemption analysis in support of the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.488" offset="1827709">For that reason, we included the preemption argument, but it is our position that the Commerce Clause standing alone by itself prohibits state exercise of jurisdiction in this situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="441.623" offset="1892179">That is, that the fact that the Solicitor General as amicus curiae raises an issue doesn't mean that it's necessarily... he's entitled to do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="958.417" offset="3959405">Most clearly, the comments in the congressional history seem to indicate quite clearly that Congress assumed that Attleboro prohibited all state regulation of sales at wholesale and interstate commerce, and as indicated in the United States versus Public Utilities Commission case and the Colton case, this Court has affirmed that reading of the Attleboro line of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.327" offset="4067030">Also in the United States versus Public Utilities Commission decision the court observed that the Natural Gas Act and the Federal Power Act established limitations on the Federal Power Commission which</text>
            <text syncTime="999.869" offset="4125230">"were designed to coordinate precisely with those constitutionally imposed on the states. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.257" offset="4150726">Now, this brings us to the Colton case which concerned FPC jurisdiction over sales by Southern California Edison Company entirely to customers located in central and southern California, although the sales in issue apparently included some very small portion of energy which was generated outside the state of Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.731" offset="4244662">Two of the holdings of that case are important in our view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.386" offset="4263261">First, in view of the Federal Power Act's establishment of federal jurisdiction in precisely the area which had been denied to the states, the holding that Edison sales were sales at wholesale in interstate commerce under FPC jurisdiction leads us to the conclusion that AECC sales, also at wholesale in interstate commerce, are beyond state power to regulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.126" offset="4362213">Second, we think it important that Colton noted that the Attleboro line of cases and the test established therein and adopted by Congress made inappropriate a case-by-case analysis of the impact of state regulation of sales at wholesale in interstate commerce, but cut it cleanly and said that those sales were entirely within federal power to regulate and beyond state power to regulate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1108.106" offset="4558132">If you want to apply the Pike versus Bruce Church analysis, Your Honor, we believe that state regulation of these sales is still inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.993" offset="4597733">AECC as an electric cooperative is, by statute and command of law, a non-profit organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.146" offset="4630334">Its revenues must equal its expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.815" offset="4649038">If the state of Arkansas, through regulating the sales to the Arkansas local distribution cooperatives, reduces the revenues which AECC obtains from those sales, then AECC, to remain non-profit by command of law, would then have to raise the prices which it charges to these multi-state systems to and with which it sells and exchanges energy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.615" offset="4776202">So for that reason, it would be our conclusion that even under a Pike versus Bruce Church analysis there would be such an impact on interstate commerce, in addition to all of the reasons stated in the Attleboro line of cases that regulation of these sales should be beyond state power, even if they have not already been so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.213" offset="4874631">It is our position in this case that Attleboro's recognition of the paramount national importance of the regulation of sales of electricity at wholesale in interstate commerce is even more appropriate today than it was in 1927.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.579" offset="4976091">This is because of the recent development of these vast, multi-state, interconnected grids and pools which are designed to provide power more reliably and more economically.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.466" offset="5023634">By utilizing both the facilities of these interstate systems or grids and by utilizing energy generated in several states including Arkansas, AECC makes the necessary power and energy available to its member cooperatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.271" offset="5090821">Attleboro, in our opinion, is still good constitutional law, and regulation of these sales by the state of Arkansas is beyond their constitutional power, and for that reason, we think that the decision of the Supreme Court of Arkansas should be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1265.012" offset="5185802">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.805" offset="5212969">AECC's argument that state regulation of its rights is precluded by the Commerce Clause was heard and rejected by the Arkansas Public Service Commission and by a majority of the Arkansas Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.159" offset="5262393">Specifically, as you've heard AECC argue, that this Court's decision in Attleboro and the line of cases on which the Attleboro court relied, precludes state regulation of its sales to the retail cooperatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.248" offset="5314742">We disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.482" offset="5323624">AECC has interpreted Attleboro as barring state regulation of wholesale sales in interstate commerce, and it is argued that its sales to the retail cooperatives are such sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.367" offset="5379212">Now, although these sales are physically intrastate, we agree that for purposes of determining the scope of congressional power under the Commerce Clause, these sales are in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.564" offset="5440026">We do not, however, agree that Attleboro requires a reversal of the result below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.014" offset="5461759">Factually, Attleboro is clearly distinct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.074" offset="5486001">That case involved physically intrastate sales between utilities in different states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.056" offset="5509929">This case involves physically... excuse me, Attleboro involved physically interstate sales between utilities in separate states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.053" offset="5545978">This case involves physically intrastate sales between utilities in the same state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.580" offset="5571996">AECC has not really relied on the factual similarities in the two cases, but it has relied on some of the language and analysis in Attleboro and in the Attleboro line of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.842" offset="5625077">The Attleboro court I think started with the premise that the states could not impose a direct burden on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.761" offset="5656737">Wholesale rights were generally seen to be in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.524" offset="5675859">Retail rights were generally seen to be essentially local.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.539" offset="5691846">Rate regulation was seen to be a burden on commercial activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.818" offset="5708982">Therefore, the states could regulate the retail rates but they couldn't regulate the wholesale rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.064" offset="5733955">AECC's mistake, I think, is in assuming that this Court's analysis of Commerce Clause issues has not evolved beyond this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.997" offset="5781707">The doctrine that a state can never impose a direct burden on interstate commerce is simply no longer the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.964" offset="5813577">Professor Lawrence Tribe, in his book, "American Constitutional Law" discusses the Attleboro decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.632" offset="5844297">He doesn't criticize the result reached there, but he does say this of the analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.615" offset="5864150">He says, the opinion was couched in terms of the now-discredited direct/indirect dichotomy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.800" offset="5892884">And then quoting from the opinion,</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.766" offset="5900826">"Being the imposition of a direct burden on interstate commerce, it must necessarily fall. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.640" offset="5916290">I think the later decisions of this Court support Professor Tribe's characterization of the direct/indirect dichotomy as a now-discredited doctrine.</text>

            <text syncTime="1468.820" offset="6001031">--I think so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.271" offset="6018795">For example, in the South Carolina State Highway Department versus the Barlowe Brothers, the court says that indeed, in many instances, state regulation of interstate commerce has been upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.143" offset="6066337">Mr. Justice Stone, writing for the Court, recited dozens of cases in which state regulation of a variety of subjects... railroads, navigable waterways, highways, quarantine laws, game laws... had been upheld, even though, he said, in each of these cases, regulation involves a burden on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.084" offset="6162050">But so long as the state action does not discriminate, the burden is one which the Constitution permits because it is an inseparable incident of the exercise of a legislative authority which, under the Constitution, has been left to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.173" offset="6226416">I think a more recent case reflecting the court's departure from the direct burden analysis used in Attleboro is FERC versus Mississippi, decided just last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.839" offset="6277093">In that case, the court said that retail rates were in interstate commerce, but noted... and I don't think anyone doubted it... that the states retained the power to regulate retail rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.630" offset="6328293">Now, under the direct burden test, if retail rates are in interstate commerce, the states can't regulate them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.878" offset="6357237">The fact that retail rates are now seen to be in interstate commerce and yet, the state's power to regulate them isn't contested, I think is evidence of how far the court has come from the direct burden analysis used in Attleboro.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.948" offset="6421498">Now, the Colton case doesn't endorse the position... doesn't the support the position of AECC, and doesn't endorse the Attleboro decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.960" offset="6473534">The Colton case cites an earlier case interpreting the Natural Gas Act, the Illinois Natural Gas Company case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.267" offset="6514808">And in both those cases, the court says that two lines of cases dealing with state power under the Commerce Clause exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.762" offset="6556812">The Attleboro line and the more flexible line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.355" offset="6575098">And the court says that... I think implicitly in Colton and expressly in Illinois Natural Gas... that it doesn't have to choose... that in those cases it didn't have to choose between the two lines of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.474" offset="6643643">That when Congress passed the Natural Gas Act and when it passed the Federal Power Act, it had Attleboro in mind, and it was trying to remedy what it saw as the jurisdictional back credit by Attleboro.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.076" offset="6702053">The court interpreted the Natural Gas Act and the Federal Power Act accordingly to simply achieve the intent of Congress, and Congress had Attleboro in mind when it passed those statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1666.224" offset="6790661">Isn't there a kind of a built-in safety factor that the Board and the members themselves would keep these rates at a reasonable level?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeff Broadwater</label>
            <text syncTime="1680.390" offset="6847294">Well, I think whether or not the Commission ought to regulate AECC is a legislative question, and the legislature of the state of Arkansas has decided we ought to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.293" offset="6890866">And I think there are some factors that support that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.542" offset="6907898">I don't think AECC has really presented any evidence to us exactly how the self-regulation works.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.210" offset="6938618">I know it takes the Commission a team of accountants and engineers and economists and lawyers to set and design electric rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.003" offset="6973727">I think it's really unlikely that the average customer or the average retail cooperative is going to be in a position to be able to really participate in the making of AECC's rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.936" offset="7025449">I don't see how self-regulation would necessarily protect the interest of a minority within the cooperative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.714" offset="7056587">I don't know what's to stop a majority within the cooperative from deciding they're going to force the minority to subsidize them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.305" offset="7082919">And something I would note just in passing... each one of the cooperatives has the same representation on AECC's board, regardless of the size of the cooperative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.205" offset="7146553">Which means the one man/one vote rule that this Court has said is required in the legislative bodies doesn't even exist on the AECC's board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.638" offset="7188244">So I wonder how representative it may be of the members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.683" offset="7212486">I think this Court in recent cases has, indeed, chosen between the rigid test selected in Attleboro and the more flexible test, and I think in Pike versus Bruce Church and in subsequent cases it has adopted the more flexible test.</text>

            <text syncTime="1803.748" offset="7340695">I don't agree with that, because I think that first, the sales are essentially local.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.369" offset="7375177">They're between an Arkansas buyer and an Arkansas seller.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.195" offset="7390537">Virtually all the electricity is consumed in Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.225" offset="7406628">AECC has three plants in Arkansas; it owns partial interest in three others; virtually all of the power is generated in Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.518" offset="7447797">All the parties to the transactions have ready access to the political and legal processes of the state of Arkansas for the protection of their interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.577" offset="7484055">Now, AECC has said that well, since some of this power may come from out of state, it's not essentially local and the state shouldn't be allowed to regulate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.636" offset="7524283">In response to that, I would say that same power is the power that's sold at the retail level, and we're there allowed to regulate that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.350" offset="7559079">So that the aside of generation may not necessarily be controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.364" offset="7575170">So I think under Pike versus Bruce Church, first, we should prevail because it's essentially local, and second, really the only burden that the AECC has alleged, I think, is the burden of having to participate in a rate-making procedure before a state regulatory commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.464" offset="7667539">Well, that burden is no different than the burden we're allowed to impose at the retail level, and it's no different than the burden that Congress has imposed on the wholesale sale of investor-owned utilities before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.083" offset="7726053">So I think that a burden that is clearly permissible in these other contexts shouldn't be held to clearly outweigh the state interest in essentially local commercial activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.423" offset="7783418">And I think Pike versus Bruce Church is the proper test.</text>

            <text syncTime="1957.639" offset="7956244">And I think it was that and also, we should remember that the Federal Power Act was passed, I think, in 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.433" offset="7995428">The REA was passed in 1936, so when Congress passed the Federal Power Act they didn't have really a clear idea of what form the cooperatives were going to take.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.086" offset="8038060">And I think in part because of that, the Federal Power Commission was hesitant to exert jurisdiction over something that didn't really exist when the Federal Power Commission was created.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.565" offset="8079960">But it wasn't the distinction between wholesale and retail rates that was crucial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.953" offset="8113501">The purpose that the Commerce Clause is designed to achieve is to, I think, promote free trade among the states and to prevent economic warfare among the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.934" offset="8161462">And I think that the more flexible test in Pike versus Bruce Church would better accomplish that purpose than a mechanical distinction between wholesale and retail rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.116" offset="8202213">For example, imagine a generating cooperative selling electricity... doing business in one state, selling electricity to a small rural retail cooperative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.330" offset="8255085">And imagine a large investor-owned utility selling large amounts of power to a multi-national manufacturing concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.171" offset="8290403">Which has the greater impact on interstate commerce and on the national economy?</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.372" offset="8307226">I suggest the retail sale to the large manufacturing company may really be of greater significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.979" offset="8337632">And I would also suggest that the abuses the Commerce Clause was designed to prevent may be more likely to occur in the case of the retail sales because there, the state commission may be tempted to set that industrial customer's rates very high so he can subsidize other customer classes, and then they'll expect him to recover his added costs through sales in other states or even in foreign countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.390" offset="8435330">The mechanical distinction between wholesale and retail rates would have the Commerce Clause I think ignore those kind of political and economic realities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.871" offset="8473260">AECC in its brief argued the virtue of self-regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.539" offset="8511921">It was the opinion of the Arkansas legislature that self-regulation was not the answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.801" offset="8532923">Twenty-five states have placed retail cooperatives under the Jurisdiction of state regulatory commissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.659" offset="8560404">Yet, AECC is one step farther removed from the ultimate customer than are the retail cooperatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.859" offset="8585168">And for that reason, I would suggest that the need for state regulation in the case of AECC is even greater than the need for state regulation in the case of the retail cooperatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.589" offset="8624039">And neither is REA regulation sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.260" offset="8638772">AECC admits that REA gives it considerable discretion in setting its rates, and no real evidence has been presented that REA examines, say, questions of rate design.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.848" offset="8685165">Even though the commission noted in its brief that we consider rate design issues to be as important as questions dealing with the level of rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.767" offset="8724767">I think the reason for the lack of scrutiny from REA is obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.419" offset="8751412">There are over a thousand cooperatives subject to the jurisdiction of the administrator of the REA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.668" offset="8776385">If only a fourth of those cooperatives seek rate increases annually, the Administrator of the REA is reduced to reviewing one rate case virtually every working day.</text>

            <text syncTime="2176.507" offset="8831764">And there's even very little statutory authority that would, I think, justify their getting in the rate-making business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.534" offset="8863843">Section 904 of the REA provides that before the administrator makes loans, he should certify that reasonable adequate security exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.624" offset="8904176">And that's really all there is, I think, in the Act from which you can infer any REA authority over the rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.901" offset="8941374">As a matter of fact, when the Rural Electrification Act was pending before Congress, the first administrator of the REA testified before a congressional committee that he thought the setting of rates was entirely a state matter, and that he didn't have any jurisdiction over the setting of rates within a single state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.671" offset="9048372">Now, you might ask, did he have retail... only retail rates in mind or was he thinking in terms of wholesale rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.418" offset="9079405">I think it's very likely that the testimony went to both wholesale and retail rates because the original Act provided for the creation of both wholesale and retail cooperatives.</text>

            <text syncTime="2298.378" offset="9319209">I would suggest that this failure of proof demonstrates that this alleged conflict is really mere speculation and that if it ever does occur, I think that's something that Congress could remedy.</text>
