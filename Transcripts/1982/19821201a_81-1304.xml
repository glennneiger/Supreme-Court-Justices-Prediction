            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="150650">We will hear arguments first this morning in 81-1304, on the consolidated case, National Association of Greeting Card Publishers against the United States Postal Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.277" offset="203731">Mr. Segal, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="bernard_g_segal" startTime="16.010" stopTime="306.190">
            <label>Mr. Bernard G. Segal</label>
            <text syncTime="16.010" offset="214598">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case involves the rate-making provisions of the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970, which eliminated the Post Office Department and transferred its functions to the United States Postal Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.216" offset="347509">Since the new agency was to operate the first class letter monopoly as well as provide classes of mail competitive with enterprises in the private sector, Congress enacted unique rate-making provisions designed to prevent the Postal Service from utilizing the monopoly power, by overcharging first class mail users, and subsidizing other classes of mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.203" offset="467359">I shall discuss the statutory language which seeks to effectuate this Congressional purpose by requiring that the rates for each class of mail recover the costs caused by the class.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.948" offset="530366">Mr. Perlman, counsel for the other Petitioner, will demonstrate that the legislative history confirms the plain meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.506" offset="568609">Initially, I note a very substantial concession made by the Postal Service in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.737" offset="597553">The Postal Service had participated in persuading the Second Circuit to rule that the Act does not require long-term, but calls only for short-term costing, variable costing.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.700" offset="665367">By virtue of this holding, the $3 billion of cost which formerly had been attributed to various classes of mail can now be shifted to the first class mail monopoly, this by virtue of the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.408" offset="752198">Now, the Postal Service, in the Solicitor General's brief in this Court, concedes that costs vary with volume in the long run, and must be attributed that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.294" offset="799741">Although four Respondents still adhere to the view, nevertheless, the language of the statute clearly compels the concession, and calls for reversal of the Second Circuit decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.600" offset="869017">Despite the concession, the Postal Service still improperly limits attributable costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.596" offset="904962">The Postal Service says that attributable costs are only those costs that can be proven by statistics to vary with changes in volume, but the language of the Act contains no such limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.231" offset="967551">Section 3622(b)(3), and I read the requisite provision, that</text>
            <text syncTime="212.337" offset="999943">"each class of mail or type of mail service bear the direct and indirect postal costs attributable to that class or type. "</text>
            <text syncTime="223.693" offset="1045396">and that is all it says.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.957" offset="1054382">Congress did not use technical language.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.377" offset="1064100">It employed as the key word "attributable", which the dictionary says is caused or brought about by, and it couldn't have used the more all-inclusive word, I submit.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.653" offset="1117181">As the District of Columbia Circuit stated so well, the Commission cannot stop with statistical variability in looking for causal connections between costs and classes of mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.741" offset="1177576">It must go on, as does all business, to other inferences of causation, deductive analysis, logic, common sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.440" offset="1216341">Section 3622(b)(3), the costing section, also couples the attributable cost requirement with a requirement that each class of mail must also bear that portion, and I am quoting,</text>
            <text syncTime="281.669" offset="1277259">"of all other costs reasonably assignable to such class. "</text>
            <text syncTime="287.838" offset="1301919">The fact that the reasonably assignable section is in the costing subsection makes it clear that some unattributed costs must be reasonably assigned on specific cost of service principles.</text>

            <label>Mr. Bernard G. Segal</label>
            <text syncTime="431.611" offset="1877030">United Parcel Service does run its business quite differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.750" offset="1897615">There is no cost that is not attributed to what causes the cost, or it would be a very unsound pricing situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.166" offset="1935231">And the District of Columbia Circuit had them well in line.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.775" offset="1953726">It is this new case which is causing us all of the concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.475" offset="1980475">The first class letter monopoly, soon to become, by the way, the nation's largest monopoly after AT&amp;T, will provide $13 billion of income this year, 57 percent of the total revenue of the Postal Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.103" offset="2094996">Much of the remaining revenues from other types of mail where they compete with business in the private sector, the governors of the Postal Service in this very case in their opinion stated, and I quote, that</text>
            <text syncTime="504.237" offset="2167512">"the Postal Service's goal is to encourage significant increases in volume in an increasingly competitive market situation. "</text>
            <text syncTime="514.685" offset="2209308">That means, take just this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.323" offset="2239923">Although they have had an enormous increase, virtually twice the CPI since 1971, they ask for an increase of 33 and one-third percent in the revenues of first class mail and 8.3 percent for parcel post, which competes with United Parcel Service and with thousands of others in the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.964" offset="2378477">So, I need not tell you how concerned those in the industry are.</text>

            <label>Mr. Bernard G. Segal</label>
            <text syncTime="569.024" offset="2426647">We are worried that the more they are subsidized, Justice Rehnquist, the less they will ask for money for Parcel Post.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.772" offset="2449634">They are using the subsidization, the excess of the money that they get for first class, to subsidize these classes which compete, and there isn't any question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.375" offset="2500103">But I might say to Your Honor, that we are not the only ones concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.529" offset="2524763">Instrumentalities of the federal government are deeply concerned that the Postal Service not be permitted to take advantage of its enormous letter monopoly to subsidize services, as I have just said, which compete.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.819" offset="2597906">Thus, within the past year, the Department of Justice, through the Antitrust Division, went to court to enjoin the Postal Service from instituting an electronic mail service known as ECOM, in competition with private enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.170" offset="2675228">The Antitrust Division took this action because it said, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="639.291" offset="2707724">"ECOM would be subsidized and would pre-empt private sector activity. "</text>
            <text syncTime="645.477" offset="2732488">Significantly also, just two months ago, the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives published a unanimous report on the same new ECOM operation of the Postal Service in competition with private industry, a new service.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.046" offset="2822768">This is the finding of the House Committee unanimous:</text>
            <text syncTime="671.779" offset="2837710">"that the current ECOM rate is not compensatory, that the Postal Service has known for some time now that this is so, and therefore that ECOM is being subsidized by other Postal Services in violation of Section 3622(b)(3). "</text>
            <text syncTime="691.240" offset="2915554">That is signed by William Baxter.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.879" offset="2926108">So that, Your Honors, we are in a situation where Congress took very specific action.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.718" offset="2985458">It had experienced, it knew the pressures over all the years, and incidentally, from the time Parcel Post was started in 1913, the ICC had... the Congress didn't even give itself jurisdiction over that.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.569" offset="3064870">Now that it was all to be cost oriented, they thought it was all right to permit this very competitive role to be handled, and in a succession of opinions, three panels of the District of Columbia circuit have gradually brought under control more and more this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.400" offset="3176152">But the difficulty is that you have, as you have read, the desire, as I have just read to you, the desire of the governors to grow, to get bigger, and to compete in the market, and they are competing by subsidization.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.798" offset="3265804">In concluding, so I will have time for rebuttal, I submit that anything but a literal application of Section 3622(b)(3), as in the decisions of the District of Columbia circuit, would greatly increase the opportunity of the Postal Service to subsidize competitive classes of mail out of excess revenues of monopoly first class letter mail.</text>

            <text syncTime="1316.195" offset="5415368">As Mr. Segal stated, the word "attribute", chosen by the Conference Committee and came out of the Senate bill, has no technical meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.441" offset="5464374">The Postal Service attempts to counter this by legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.547" offset="5496766">They give a definition of a phrase, "costs demonstrably related", which was used by the Kaple Commission, which recommended establishing the Postal Service, and was used again in the House bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.605" offset="5552981">Now, a variety of definitions were given to that phrase.</text>

            <text syncTime="1357.913" offset="5582239">One set of definitions clearly is the one the Postal Service is relying on, but other definitions were used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.895" offset="5610137">But assuming for the moment that the Postal Service is correct, that that meaning of the House words and the House bill had a technical meaning, the Conference Committee rejected those words.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.233" offset="5663532">They did not take the words of art and put them into the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.263" offset="5679623">They took words from the Senate bill, "attributable and assignable", with no technical meanings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.152" offset="5703238">And we think if they really meant volume variable cost, it would have been very easy for Congress to say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.133" offset="5731137">Now, Respondents take the position that the House was tough on costing and the Senate wasn't, and they based that on the fact that there was no explicit rate floor in the Senate bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.080" offset="5794875">The Senate bill said, you will consider costs with a list of factors, but didn't state explicitly that there was a rate floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.685" offset="5829357">Now, that was corrected in conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.810" offset="5837821">In the Conference Committee, the word "requirement" was added and the concept of a rate floor was made explicit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.150" offset="5867182">We think it was implicit in the Senate bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.650" offset="5877213">But to indicate that the House was really taking the lenient attitude on cost, we have to look at another section of the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.582" offset="5912949">Section 1201(d) of the House bill provided that if the various statutory factors produced too much hardship, the governors could ignore them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.936" offset="5974389">Now, that was dropped in the Senate bill, in the conference.</text>

            <text syncTime="1462.105" offset="5999048">And we think that is an indication by Congress that attribution was to be required and all means of attribution were to be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.023" offset="6050666">The legislative history in the Senate is replete with concerns that first class was used as a cover-up it was used for the financial shortcomings of the Postal Service.</text>

            <text syncTime="1496.249" offset="6135617">And the Senate was concerned that this historical practice not be continued when it wasn't cost justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.589" offset="6172919">Now, Congressman Udall, who was the sponsor of the bill on the House side, was a supporter of cross-subsidization.</text>

            <text syncTime="1539.887" offset="6310114">He said it was costs that varied in the short run.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.089" offset="6322967">The Postal Service has now conceded that as incorrect, but they attempt to explain it away.</text>

            <text syncTime="1712.894" offset="7002150">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, let me begin by allaying Justice White's concern about the government's concession in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.718" offset="7041439">As a matter of fact before the Postal Rate Commission in this case, the Postal Service attributed approximately 13 percent of the services... of the costs of the Postal Service as long-run variable costs, and took the position before the Rate Commission, as it has in each of the prior two general rate proceedings, that long-run variable costs are attributable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.084" offset="7134957">In the Second Circuit, what the government's... what the Postal Service's brief said in making the point that indirect costs are attributable by cost variation, they quoted the House conferees' report and said Congress did make quite plain that short-term cost variability, quoting from the conferee's report,</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.107" offset="7219071">"was the method prescribed for identifying direct and indirect attributable costs. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.558" offset="7240805">The court of appeals, contrary to the suggestion of UPS, did not hold that only short-term variable costs are attributable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.789" offset="7273719">As a matter of fact, in the... at Page 24 of the court of appeals' opinion, it said this: "The Commission", speaking of the Kaple Commission, on which the bill was... on whose labors the bill was in large part based,</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.736" offset="7337563">"The Commission suggested that discrimination in rates would not occur as long as each class covered as a minimum the long-run variable costs ascribable to it, the full added cost demonstrably related to that class. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.917" offset="7398271">And then the court goes on to say,</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.228" offset="7407466">"This suggestion was embodied in the administration's bill, H.R. 11750, and the subsequent House bill. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.570" offset="7436828">which the court then goes on to say is the language adopted by the conference.</text>

            <text syncTime="1831.253" offset="7475594">There are two references in the Second Circuit's opinion to short-run variability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.110" offset="7507045">The references are a quotation of the House conferees' report which did in fact use the term</text>

            <text syncTime="1852.087" offset="7558977">On Page 27, they say, again, that,</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.915" offset="7578307">"As to the level of attribution required, we conclude that the definition of that term in the Conference Committee report is controlling. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.240" offset="7611535">speaking of the definition which addressed variability with volume and which addressed attribution of specific fixed costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.580" offset="7644867">I think that it is only the most tortured reading of the court of appeals opinion which can limit it to short-run variable costs.</text>

            <text syncTime="1880.312" offset="7671826">What do you have to say, Mr. Garvey, about that general proposition, whether myth or reality, that upper class mails have been carrying the junk mail to people's doors at the expense of the upper class mails?</text>

            <label>Mr. John H. Garvey</label>
            <text syncTime="1895.649" offset="7733161">The Postal Reorganization Act was designed to eliminate or to preclude in the future if it had not happened in the past that sort of discrimination against not only third... not only first class mail, but other classes of mail as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.940" offset="7790317">3622(b)(3), the provision in the statute which is at issue in this case, says that each class of mail shall bear... as a minimum, sets a rate floor which each class must pay, what it calls the long-run... what the Kaple Commission called the long-run variable costs, what the House bill called demonstrably related costs, what the Senate report called incremental costs, and the reason for requiring each class of mail to pay those kinds of costs was that that's necessary to avoid what is a subsidy in the true economic sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.659" offset="7941200">In the real economic sense, a subsidy exists when Class A would actually be better if Class B did not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.406" offset="7976204">So, for example, if, the example the Kaple Commission gave was, if you have a machine that is just used for sorting parcels, and first class mail were required to pick up some of the cost of purchasing that machine, then first class mail would actually be worse off if fourth class mail were served then if it were not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.524" offset="8052691">With respect to the kinds of mail that you are concerned about, bulk mail in third class is introduced into the postal system already presorted by zip code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.112" offset="8103055">It doesn't need to be cancelled because it hasn't got a stamp on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.719" offset="8117474">It is already in sacks, and it is brought to the Post Office in that fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.391" offset="8136178">First class mail, the kind that is sent from one household to another, the kind that the Greeting Card Publishers are concerned with in this case, is collected by the Post Office from collection boxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.323" offset="8183930">It is then brought to the Post Office facility, where it is cancelled, and then sorted according to zip code, and then it is sent to a destination where it is again sorted according to the last two digits of the zip code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.567" offset="8240877">All of those kinds of expenses are eliminated by presortation and the lack of need for cancellation and presacking of third class mail, so that it is really comparing apples and oranges to say that third class mail may cost ten cents and first class mail may cost 20 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.701" offset="8313393">For one thing, the statute requires that third class mail bear all the costs that are attributable to that class.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.885" offset="8342128">For another thing, the Act permits the Postal Service to apportion the institutional costs above that minimum in accordance with the statutory factors set out by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.208" offset="8387476">Justice O'Connor and Justice Rehnquist have suggested that it looks to them from reading the Act as though the Postal Rate Commission was probably left with considerable discretion in apportioning the costs of the Postal Service which were institutional costs above these long-run variable costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.215" offset="8471486">In fact, what the Act says in Section 3522(b) is that in setting rates, the Postal Rate Commission is to implement a number of policies which Congress gave to the Commission as specific directives in setting costs of mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.240" offset="8531568">The statute says that the Postal Rate Commission shall make the rates fair and equitable, that it shall consider the value of service rendered to each class of mail, that each class shall bear its attributable cost, that the Rate Commission shall consider the effect on the general public, on business mail users, on--</text>

            <text syncTime="2522.272" offset="10239662">The question in this case is really how far the Postal Service and the Commission are required to go in discovering what kinds of costs are caused by particular classes of mail, and the Postal Service does not take the position that it has to be proven by empirical studies to vary with volume to a specific percentage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.010" offset="10346660">But what the Postal Service and the Commission do have in mind is that volume variation, and when I say volume variation, I mean variation with the number of pieces, or with the weight, or with the cubic dimensions of the mail, is the way to identify the causes of common costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.815" offset="10429834">For example, if you have a lot of different classes being sorted at the mail facility, and according to zip code, and stamped, and that sort of thing, if you have 100 letters to sort according to zip code and to stamp, it is going to take approximately twice as long as it would take to sort and cancel 50 letters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.259" offset="10515620">Those kinds of costs amounted to about five billion costs in this general rate proceeding, and the Postal Service attributed 100 percent of those costs to the various classes of mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.395" offset="10560132">What the Petitioners are contending in this case is that what they call cost of service principles ought to be used to distribute various joint costs among the various classes of mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.141" offset="10615199">For example, when the postman goes around his route with a bag full of mail, if he has 100 letters in his bag, it is not going to take him any longer to go around the route than it would if he had 50 letters in the bag.</text>

            <text syncTime="2983.679" offset="12085266">There was a study done of the cost ascertainment system, a system of fully distributed costs which the Postal Service used from 1926 until the Act was passed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3390.217" offset="13711440">The percentage which the Postal Service identified in this case was 59.3 percent of the total revenue requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.306" offset="13743832">The Postal Rate Commission itself in this case attributed 64 percent of the total cost, and then, according to the principles of service-related cost, assigned another approximately 9 or 10 percent of the costs of the postal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.988" offset="13806526">So that what was actually done by the Commission was an attribution and assignment of 74 percent of the costs.</text>

            <text syncTime="3431.371" offset="13876116">What the Postal Reorganization Act requires is that the Postal Service and the Postal Rate Commission in setting rates for the various classes of mail engage in essentially a two-step process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.161" offset="13951244">The first of those steps is the requirement that each class of mail bear the direct and indirect costs attributable to that class of mail, which include both specific fixed costs and costs that vary with volume over the long run.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.343" offset="14011953">After that sort of attribution is done, 3622(b)(3) goes on to say that the Postal Service should assign all of the other costs of the Postal Service in some reasonable fashion, and what Congress had in mind in structuring that sort of assignment of the remaining costs were the policies embodied in 3622(b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(4) through (9), the last of which is any other factors which the Commission considers relevant.</text>

            <text syncTime="3518.976" offset="14226470">The reason the service is concerned about the allocation of service-related costs is that for one thing the principles of causation which would be the reason for tracing those kinds of costs are somewhat diminished by the fact that Congress has now said that even if there aren't preferential classes of mail, the service is still required to adhere to the same delivery system, and what is more, even if they were caused by the preferential classes of mail, there is no denying that other classes of mail are delivered six days a week along with the preferential classes, so that they would be getting a free ride if those costs were only charged to first and second class mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.803" offset="14389788">On the other hand, the Postal Service concedes, as the court of appeals held and as the Commission believes in this case, that there are similarities between service-related costs and what in utility ratemaking generally are called peak load costs or there are also similarities between service-related costs and the kinds of specific fixed costs with which you have been concerned, and those similarities suggest that that question about the proper distribution of service-related costs is perhaps one which ought to be left to the expert judgment of the Postal Rate Commission and in a proper case the Postal Service.</text>

            <text syncTime="3652.953" offset="14762399">Congress was disgusted with the politics of rate fixing, had decided to get rid of it, and had decided to give it to an independent agency, but it was wise enough to know that it had to set up all kinds of safeguards, and it did it in the simplest, wisest way in 3622(b)(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.022" offset="14854663">It did it by the requirement of attribution, by the requirement of reasonable assignment, and then left it to the discretion.</text>

            <text syncTime="3692.000" offset="14918611">He has said, oh, no, short-term is enough, and that is 50 percent, but this doesn't mean that they can't do whatever they want.</text>
            <text syncTime="3701.013" offset="14954660">They can go up to 100 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3702.839" offset="14961974">Well, I suggest to Your Honors that that was not what Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3708.009" offset="14982663">Congress intended to give the discretion to run a business within rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3712.008" offset="14998650">Congress intended that the... not simply that they could set a rule that long-term variable costs... it would be the only business in America that would go on that basis only, namely, long-term variable.</text>

            <text syncTime="3735.732" offset="15093527">So, there is no doubt, to answer the questions of Justice O'Connor and Justice Blackmun and Justice Stevens, they did intend to give discretion to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3746.415" offset="15136263">They gave a discretion to the Postal Service unheard of in the past in American life to under certain conditions fix its own rates, different from the Commission, which indeed it has done on the 20 cents, when the Commission said it should be 18 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3765.611" offset="15213063">But it has got to do it by rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3768.297" offset="15223826">And it has put the rules into effect to give it control, and now Judge Meskel comes along and says, no, we only have to give them 50 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3779.949" offset="15270428">Well, if they give them 50 percent, and 50 percent of all costs are in the discretion of someone whom the Department of Justice has gone to court, and I won't repeat here the language which the Department used in describing the conduct of the head of the Postal Service in that case, and the Department of Commerce has come out in despair, and now a Committee of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3807.204" offset="15379411">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="3807.782" offset="15381710">Because they are not adhering to the requirements of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3816.794" offset="15417759">Every year they are doing better under the decisions of the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3821.479" offset="15436462">The Second Circuit decision, Your Honors, would catapult us back to 1971, when the District of Columbia circuit court in desperation said, here are rules, but you are not following any of them, so we can't reach a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3841.126" offset="15515143">All we can tell you is what to do next time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3842.876" offset="15522144">Then, in the second decision, they told them what to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3845.985" offset="15534578">And the Commission did it, but the Postal Service wouldn't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3850.826" offset="15553909">And so in the third case, the court got stronger, and they have come up closer.</text>
