            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="8.658" offset="126895">This case comes to us from the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.853" offset="143718">A group of people in Kansas and Colorado have borrowed money from several loan companies before in November 1978 and each of these individuals gave the loan company a lien on household furnishings and appliances as security for the debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.137" offset="212786">In November 1978, Congress passed a new bankruptcy law.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.250" offset="229295">One provision of this permits individuals who become bankrupt to avoid some liens on household furnishings and appliances.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.381" offset="265762">Some time after the new law became effective, each of these individual borrowers, in our case, filed for bankruptcy and the Bankruptcy Courts in Kansas and Colorado each claimed the new law entitled them to keep the household goods notwithstanding the lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.451" offset="330023">Each of the loan companies protested, it would unconstitutional to apply this law to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.927" offset="351966">They relied on the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution which forbids the Government to take private property for public use without just compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.692" offset="391045">United States Government appeared on behalf of the individuals to defend the constitutionality of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.569" offset="414556">In each case, the Bankruptcy Courts in Kansas and Colorado ruled for the loan company.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.889" offset="435767">The Government appealed and the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit agreed with the loan companies that the statute is unconstitutional, although they agreed with the Government that the statute was intended to apply to these transactions which occurred before the date the statute was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.442" offset="510059">We have decided we not -- need not decide whether these laws unconstitutional because we determined that Congress did not intend the statute to apply to liens that were created before it was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.520" offset="558333">In the rather early case of Holt against Henley decided in 1914, this Court established the principle of construction that no bankruptcy law shall be interpreted to destroy property rights that were created before the law was enacted unless Congress is explicitly required the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.246" offset="641194">In this case, an early draft of the 1978 statute contained this sort of explicit statement but Congress removed it before it passed the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.529" offset="678392">Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals under which the loan companies were entitled to obtain their liens.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.632" offset="702738">Justice Blackmun joined by Justice Brennan and Justice Marshall has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
