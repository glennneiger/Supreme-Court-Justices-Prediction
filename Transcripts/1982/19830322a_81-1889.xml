            <label>Mr. Jerome M. Feit</label>
            <text syncTime="14.871" offset="204280">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.821" offset="216087">This case poses a question of the statutory construction, whether Congress in the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 meant that natural gas produced by a pipeline is automatically entitled to the incentive pricing scheme under Title I of that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.923" offset="292469">Even though, as here, the gas is old gas long dedicated to the interstate market.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.280" offset="317860">In our view, the Court in holding that the first sale prices and that the pricing scheme of Title I applied to this pipeline produced gas misconceived the legislative intent and argued, granted a profit to which the pipeline were not entitled, $200 million prospectively and something over $2 billion total projected.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.801" offset="412005">These are complex matters under a complicated statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.768" offset="431858">And I think it would be helpful as I use these words to indicate we're talking about wellhead or field sales, mixed systems supply, commingling, downstream.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.279" offset="481909">I think those terms are essential to the decision making in this case and they also have functional meaning in the history of pipeline regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.947" offset="512525">A pipeline gets its gas from many wells.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.103" offset="529138">It can be, I guess, compared to a tree with roots.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.242" offset="545752">Most of these wells are operated by independent producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.208" offset="561635">Some are pipeline produced wells.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.472" offset="574696">Normally, in the usual instance, these go through gathering lines, through processing plants and commingle in the pipeline and become part of fixed pipeline supply, mixed pipeline supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.904" offset="632374">And they go downstream to the pipelines'... generally to the pipelines' regular system customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.121" offset="661214">A pipeline also, however, produces its own gas which it sells at the wellhead, principally to other pipelines, sometimes to other third parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.178" offset="713458">In this sense... and that's part of, essential of our argument... it functions like an independent producer.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.784" offset="739894">These differences have very important regulatory considerations in the historical background.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.483" offset="774689">First, very early in the application of the Natural Gas Act which was enacted in 1938, pipeline produced gas was deemed to be like other gas the pipeline transported in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.243" offset="837697">It was deemed to be part of the entire wholesale transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.631" offset="859326">Colorado Interstate, a decision of this Court, made that clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.178" offset="873537">And it was subject to the cost-of-service methodology which, as the Court knows, places the initial risk on the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.594" offset="915124">The gas of that nature is the gas involved here, where the risk, as I say, is the consumer risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.340" offset="954098">On the other hand, as the Court will recall, it was not until 1954, when the Phillips case was decided, that the independent producer was deemed to be a natural gas company covered by the Act, by the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.365" offset="1030272">As this Court recognized in Permian, the early years proved to be a time of very difficulty in any effort to regulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.376" offset="1062245">They didn't... they weren't natural gas companies in the traditional sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.984" offset="1076665">They didn't transport in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.700" offset="1091607">And individual cost-of-service regulation failed, as Permian points out.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.354" offset="1114177">The Commission then turned to a different way of regulating independent producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.697" offset="1135597">The regulation consisted of average industry costs based upon area and then national rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.475" offset="1166631">This was essentially an incentive type pricing.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.817" offset="1184081">For example, the risk was on the investor.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.253" offset="1197769">If an independent producer produced only dry holes, he got no recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.469" offset="1218667">If, on the other hand, he operated on less than average costs, dug a well which produced, then he was able to make a profit so that there was that investor risk approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.589" offset="1271121">Most pertinently as this development occurred, the affiliate of the pipeline, the affiliate of the pipeline, the producing affiliate of the pipeline was accorded the same treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.569" offset="1319081">More to the point here the pipeline who sold at the wellhead was given this economic risk establishment, was also treated as an independent producer would be, that you have that kind of development.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.624" offset="1391284">At the same time, as the years went on, starting in '69 when there was an indication of a gas shortage, the commission decided to give not cost based gas... all of that pre-'69 cost based gas was on cost-of-service... but mixed system supplied from a pipeline to be on parity, giving parity pricing to the independent producer, wellhead pricing, and to the pipeline, pricing of its wellhead sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.033" offset="1520956">But cost-of-service remained on cost-of-service.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.373" offset="1538301">As a matter of fact in the '70's, in the early '70's, the pipelines essentially either through agreements or through their own choice by saying we'd rather be on... we'd rather be on cost-of-service with... it serves our purposes better.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.806" offset="1607996">These special circumstance pipelines were allowed to be on cost-of-service.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.913" offset="1624401">Other pipelines as to this mixed system supply chose instead to get the area and national rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.878" offset="1660241">So you have at the time of the enactment of the Natural Gas Policy Act, that development coupled with the development that the result of the decision in the Phillips case had lead to an interstate regulated market and an intrastate unregulated market with regard to independent producer sales or sales like independent producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.836" offset="1764103">The consequence was that the market bifurcated.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.631" offset="1779254">The independent producer certainly, in shopping the market place as to his new wells, would prefer to sell it in the intrastate market, which he did... or which the producers generally did.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.706" offset="1823558">The consequences were there was less gas in the interstate market, more gas in the intrastate market, and high priced gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.781" offset="1859921">This was the bifurcation coupled with the fact that at that time the shortages commenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.482" offset="1882699">Now I would like, with that background, to turn to the statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.620" offset="1907254">Statutory language is set forth at page 2 of our main brief, or in the Appendix at E(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="448.977" offset="1940691">As the Court will note, the first portion of that statute, Section 2(21), was a definitional section.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.330" offset="1990115">It employed a term for sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.970" offset="2004639">And under that initial A of that section it appears that every sale... the universe of sales... was a first sales, kind of a jurisdictional marking point.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.277" offset="2049883">Every sale was a first sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.777" offset="2055839">The critical provision, however, is in subsection B, which says certain sales not included.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.790" offset="2087917">And the certain sales not included... and I'd like to... I think this is essential to point to the Court... that it shall not include the sale of any volume of natural gas by any interstate pipeline, intrastate pipeline, or local distribution company, or any affiliate thereof... and now the critical language... unless such sale is attributable to volumes of natural gas produced by the pipeline, the interstate pipeline, or the local distribution company, or the affiliate.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.245" offset="2213723">The Court of Appeals said, well, while there is no sale we must set up if there's a intra-corporate transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.398" offset="2250399">When the production division of a pipeline transfers the gas to the transportation division of the pipeline there is a hypothecated first sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.564" offset="2298987">Therefore the higher pricing provisions of the Title I of the Natural Gas Policy Act would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.860" offset="2328244">We think that this interpretation flies in the face of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.014" offset="2344858">Section 2(20), which is also printed at page 2 of our brief, makes it clear that the term "sale" means a transfer for value.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.057" offset="2384982">There is no transfer for value in the context of the Court of Appeals analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.976" offset="2408701">More significantly, or equally significantly, there's no contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.630" offset="2427300">There's no relationship which traditionally has been the basis of regulation by this commission... by the FERC... under the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.939" offset="2464498">The Mobil Sierra doctrine, as this Court will recall, makes it clear that the contract to the parties are the basis for the relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.061" offset="2496995">The same principle attaches quite clearly under the Natural Gas Policy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.183" offset="2525521">As this Court's decision the other day at agency... in energy reserves makes clear, the critical consideration is, you don't get the contract, you don't get the statutory price, you get the contract price or whichever is lower.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.427" offset="2586438">So it seems to me that the initial interpretation by the Court of Appeals cannot withstand the statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.642" offset="2623323">There's another interpretation which the Court of Appeals rejected, but which is made by several of the petitioners.</text>

            <text syncTime="625.624" offset="2647251">Before you leave that interpretation, am I correct in recalling that if the pipeline had a subsidiary instead of a single corporate entity that transferred from its wholly-owned production subsidiary to its transmission subsidiary, that you would regard that as a sale?</text>

            <text syncTime="649.989" offset="2744740">The difference is that the affiliate has been on cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.942" offset="2756547">He acts like an independent producer.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.800" offset="2767937">He sells under a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.018" offset="2776818">He sells at the wellhead.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.187" offset="2785491">Functionally, he's the equivalent of the independent producer, and economically in that the risk lays with the investor.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.700" offset="2815584">Conceptually the affiliate performs like an independent producer.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.121" offset="2837214">The problem that you point to in terms of perhaps intra-corporate, it's the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.477" offset="2866680">The statute has an affiliate entities limitations which makes it clear that where an affiliate producer sells to his affiliated pipeline he must sell at the comparable price sold by an independent producer.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.268" offset="2921850">Now, historically, it's not clear in the '50's how they treated the affiliate producer.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.514" offset="2946823">There's some indication that they deemed him to be part of the pipelines at the transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.512" offset="2970856">But starting, I think clearly, in the late '60's and the early '70's affiliate production was like independent producer production, both economically and both functionally.</text>

            <text syncTime="787.918" offset="3296446">That's a matter of agency interpretation based on our view that Congress left to the commission the task of harmonizing the Natural Gas Act with the Natural Gas Policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="853.860" offset="3560178">The Court of Appeals... the central assumption of the Court of Appeals... they thought that there should be no distinction between pipelines and producers.</text>

            <text syncTime="873.993" offset="3640740">If one reads the legislative history and looks at the other indicia in the statute, wellhead pricing, the need to harmonize Title 6 which retains Natural Gas Act jurisdiction, and it reads the background of the history, it's clear that Congress was making a discriminating judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.234" offset="3725690">Congress was trying to overrule Phillips.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.889" offset="3740319">The history is interesting in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.199" offset="3753589">The Senate bill purported to decontrol, deregulate old gas and keep new gas under regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.369" offset="3782219">It had an affiliate entities rule which seem to cover... cover pipeline produced gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.476" offset="3810641">On the other hand, the House bill... the House bill clearly was aimed at what they called the 1954 decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.456" offset="3838644">Well, the 1954 decision was Phillips.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.252" offset="3849824">Nor throughout the history of the debates for over two years did any pipeline that I could find in the history say, oh, yes, we're entitled to this price.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.108" offset="3889217">That view... that view, in our judgement, was the one that Congress enacted in the Natural Gas Policy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.964" offset="3920668">A discriminating statutory construction approach which meant to deal with the problem, the problem of Phillips.</text>

            <label>Mr. James D. McKinney, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="1493.290" offset="6117984">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.008" offset="6124776">This case is far less complicated than Mr. Feit would suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.037" offset="6156959">Simply stated, the question in this case is simply whether Congress intended to include or to exclude natural gas produced by pipelines and distribution companies from the coverage of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.262" offset="6237834">Now, Mr. Feit spent a great deal of time at the beginning of his argument talking about the Natural Gas Act of 1938, and that just isn't relevant to this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.102" offset="6285168">What we're concerned with here is interpreting what Congress intended to do in the Natural Gas Policy Act and this Court itself on January 4th of this year found, in the Energy Reserves case, that for gas sold in the interstate market the Natural Gas Policy Act replaced the federal price controls that had been established under the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.262" offset="6393837">Now petitioners argue that the Congress generally intended to exclude the production by pipelines and distributors from the coverage of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.243" offset="6441694">The Court of Appeals unanimously disagreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.819" offset="6460084">It found that the deference that's normally viewed, agency determination, could not justify an interpretation that was contrary to the plain meaning and the purposes and the legislative history of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.329" offset="6514105">And there is no basis whatever for disturbing that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.922" offset="6532495">In support of their position, the petitioners argue that Congress generally could not have intended to include pipeline production because this would be inconsistent with commission cost-of-service regulation for certain periods when the commission regulated production under the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.256" offset="6617759">They also argue that the Court of Appeals erred, therefore, in not deferring to their interpretation and that the Court of Appeals decision would create a substantial reworking of state and federal regulatory schemes and that the pipelines would reap a windfall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.700" offset="6699574">Now, in examining these arguments, the starting point is not the Natural Gas Act of 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.385" offset="6726324">The starting point is to recognize the reasons leading to the passage of the Natural Gas Policy Act and the structure of the pricing provisions that Congress created to deal with the problem it was confronted with in 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.269" offset="6793824">The Act was passed because of shortages that had developed in the interstate market in the 1970's that had resulted from commission regulation under the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.890" offset="6852338">It had two fundamental purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.684" offset="6859548">The first purpose was to eliminate the disparity between the interstate and the intrastate markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.369" offset="6898209">And the second purpose was to provide incentive prices to encourage production.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.272" offset="6925899">To accomplish this the Act establishes a comprehensive pricing structure applicable to all categories of natural gas production.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.079" offset="6973129">Each of those pricing categories of gas production applies to any first sale of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.136" offset="7017328">Therefore, the definition of first sale in Section 2(21) is very important, and that definition defines first sale broadly to mean any sale of any volume of natural gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.194" offset="7085560">By this broad definition, Congress plainly intended that the pricing structure of the Act would apply to all gas production sold in interstate or intrastate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.594" offset="7143134">However, without any further qualification, the ceiling prices would have applied to all downstream sales by pipelines where they were reselling gas that they had purchased by... from others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.415" offset="7210425">Now to avoid this, Subsection B of Section 2(21)--</text>

            <text syncTime="1796.919" offset="7332469">--It's at page two of the brief of the mid-law respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.898" offset="7360368">Now in Subsection B of the definition... this subsection generally provides that sales by pipelines are indeed not included within the first sale definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.313" offset="7450020">And if Congress had wanted to exclude pipeline production from the price ceilings of the act, if could have stopped right there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.013" offset="7484815">But Congress knew that while pipelines function primarily as resellers they also produce their own natural gas for sale by their systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.788" offset="7535911">And in this respect they perform the same service as any other producer and should be subject to the incentives and ceilings of the Title I pricing structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.845" offset="7584185">Congress therefore added a critically important provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.889" offset="7608322">Congress said that a pipeline or distribution company sale is excluded unless... unless such sale is attributable to volumes of natural gas produced by such interstate pipeline, intrastate pipeline, or local distribution company or any other affiliate thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.193" offset="7697556">Now this language on its face plainly is intended to provide that natural gas produced by pipeline companies should be subject to the price ceilings of the act and that the pricing structure of the act apply to volumes attributable to gas produced by the pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.858" offset="7780208">It doesn't go on to say, but only to the extent the FERC in its discretion permits, or any other limiting language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.946" offset="7820541">Petitioner's interpretation simply would leave... would read the unless cause of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.772" offset="7855858">Now Petitioners argue however that their interpretation would still leave some meaning to the unless clause while they acknowledge that pipeline production would be excluded from the acts coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.687" offset="7919493">They argued that certain sales by the pipelines into their systems other than their... into other systems than their own, would still be covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.246" offset="7957736">Now the interpretation is based on the following reasoning, that the intracorporate transfer of gas from a pipeline's producing properties is not a first sale within the meaning of the act, and secondly, that the downstream sale of the gas produced by the pipeline is mixed with other gas purchased by the pipeline and that the sale of those volumes is not exclusively comprised of the pipeline's production, words the petitioners would add to the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.872" offset="8104231">However, neither of these arguments is supportable in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.464" offset="8118650">The basic rationale that petitioners give for their positions is that their interpretation would give meaning to past commission regulation of certain pipeline production on a cost-of-service basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.567" offset="8179045">That is it, the entire rationale they rely upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.784" offset="8191898">Now first of all, this rationale is not supported even by the nature of past commission regulation itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.265" offset="8233798">Cost-of-service regulation hadn't been applied to pipeline production or to pipeline affiliate production from leases acquired after 1969 or to any production developed since 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.024" offset="8296910">And the reason that the commission had abandoned cost-of-service regulation, had abandoned that methodology because it, itself, had found that the methodology had been a failure in encouraging the pipelines to produce their own gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.187" offset="8373501">It made that finding in 1969 and abandoned the methodology.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.717" offset="8391682">Now, in addition, it should be recognized that contrary to what Mr. Feit has said this morning, or this afternoon, pipeline affiliates and pipelines themselves for their own production were treated exactly the same for comparable categories of production under Natural Gas Act regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.440" offset="8498575">There was absolutely no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.408" offset="8514353">Now even assuming arguendo then that the rationale they have put forward had any merit, it would apply with equal force to pipeline affiliate production.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.855" offset="8576211">And they make no argument that pipeline affiliate production is not expressly covered by the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.492" offset="8614768">No, the rationale they put forward doesn't apply at all to intrastate pipeline production or distributor production.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.721" offset="8655623">The commission didn't regulate that under the Natural Gas Act, and yet, Congress extended its regulation under the Natural Gas Policy Act to state production.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.122" offset="8709227">Moreover, Mr. Feit gave you no citation anywhere in the legislative history of this act which even remotely suggests that Congress sought to carve out in-production from the sweeping coverage of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.115" offset="8789266">And you can't real... you can't read the conference report accompanying this legislation and come away with anything but the distinct impression Congress meant to establish a comprehensive uniform pricing structure to apply to all gas production sold in the United States whether interstate or intrastate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.981" offset="8872649">Finally, the rationale would produce absurd results.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.212" offset="8905667">Apart from the fact that the rationale would treat pipeline affiliate production differently than pipeline affiliate... than pipeline production when they were treated the same under Natural Gas Act regulation, it also should be recognized that new gas, which is one of the categories under the Title I pricing structure, that new gas is no less new gas simply because it's produced by a pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.418" offset="9026458">Yes, produced from certain high cost geological formations, has to be produced from that formation irrespective of whether a pipeline or an independent producer produces the gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.663" offset="9075463">There are many wells throughout the country that are jointly owned by a pipeline with other producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.457" offset="9106601">It is the height of absurdity to believe that the gas produced from that well by a pipeline should be valued any different than the gas from the same well owned by an independent producer or by a pipeline affiliate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.747" offset="9171803">Now apart from the lack of support in the plain meaning of Section 2(21), there are other provisions of the act that also support the Court of Appeals decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.008" offset="9224779">Section 203(b) defines the cost of gas to be passed through to certain industrial customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.363" offset="9266262">The general rule of that section speaks of first sale acquisition costs is the price paid by the pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.451" offset="9314536">However, Subsection 2 had to state a separate rule applicable to pipeline production.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.104" offset="9349227">The separate rule expressly recognizes that the FERC must fashion rules governing the first sale acquisition cost for pipeline production.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.958" offset="9404606">Now the reference to first sale acquisition costs for pipeline production clearly evidences that Congress envisioned pipeline production would be the subject of a first sale at the intracorporate transfer point, where there is no price paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.589" offset="9491124">Otherwise, there is absolutely no meaning to that provision of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.556" offset="9514947">Notably also, the conference report accompanying the Act states that Section 501 provides authority to the commission to establish rules applicable to intracorporate transactions under the first sale definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.922" offset="9612436">Now it doesn't say that the commission can exclude sales from the coverage of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.809" offset="9636051">It says that the commission may establish rules applicable to intracorporate transactions under the first sale definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.884" offset="9672309">That clearly means the intracorporate transfers were considered by Congress to be under the first sale definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.192" offset="9709507">In fact, there is nothing in the Act which even remotely suggests that Congress intended to give the commission power to exclude production from the Act's coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.484" offset="9762693">The commission was only given the power to prevent the circumvention of the prices established in that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.136" offset="9797279">Now, petitioners argue that intracorporate transfers do not involve certain conventional indicia of a sale such as a change of title or payment of cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.101" offset="9841165">Petitioners' arguments in this respect are refuted by the plain meaning of the Act and by the commission's own regulatory methods.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.082" offset="9881080">The term 2(20), but broadly to include any sale, exchange or other transfer for value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.264" offset="9937818">Now the Court of Appeals properly rejected the narrow interpretation because it would have frustrated the comprehensive application of the act, and because it would have resulted in a rational discrimination between like categories of gas production.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.068" offset="10005005">Contrary to petitioners' argument the intracorporate transfer does have significant legal and economic effects and they are transfers for value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.751" offset="10063728">Transfer triggers the payment by the pipeline of royalties on the value of the production.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.201" offset="10093612">The transfer triggers the payment of state severance taxes on the value of the production.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.667" offset="10123392">And the transfer to the pipelines transmission system requires it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2969.133" offset="12021344">There's an Appendix D filed to the Consolidated Natural Gas Company brief in this proceeding which clearly shows that the impact of applying Natural Gas Policy Act prices to pipeline production is less than one and one half percent of the total impact of the Natural Gas Policy Act for the period of 1979 to 1981.</text>
