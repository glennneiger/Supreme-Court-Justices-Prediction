            <text syncTime="233.330" offset="1082829">One would be in the Woodson case there was no certainty that the action would terminate because there were other defendants remaining before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.103" offset="1113862">Second, as I indicated to Justice Brennan, the mandate of the Illinois Supreme Court is so directive that the Illinois Trial Court would be hard-pressed to dismiss a non-resident subclass of those people coming from states whose laws were characterized as similar to the Illinois consumer protection statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="274.240" offset="1246460">I mean we'd have to do some research to find out whether that's plausible or not, but it's at least theoretically possible.</text>

            <text syncTime="282.830" offset="1280837">Might I just add that there is language in Cox Broadcasting v. Cohn and the comparable language in an in-chambers opinion in Rosenblatt v. American Cyanimide indicates that this is the kind of question where the issue, this issue, this central issue may never come back to this Court, and you have, in effect, a destabilized situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.397" offset="1387103">In Cohn you will recall it was the question of the restraint on publication in Georgia of a rape victim's name.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.586" offset="1423779">The Supreme Court in that case felt that issue was important enough to resolve lest it not come back and leave everyone in a quandary.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.411" offset="1467142">I think as one looks around the country these days, one finds a greater and greater assertion by state courts, national class actions, some states not asserting those class actions; and we have a situation in which a good many judgments are potentially unstable and subject to collateral attack.</text>

            <text syncTime="1481.277" offset="6074620">And with great trepidation I suggest to you that given the Court's approach to state choice of law, it is now only through the maintenance of the jurisdiction principle under Shoe that this Court can guard against questionable, indeed potentially abusive applications of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.595" offset="6179841">Because in a situation in which you have no jurisdictional standing... and that is what the Respondent and the Supreme Court of Illinois have decided... in a situation in which you have no jurisdictional standing, where Illinois can take jurisdiction because it means well, then you have the spectre of cases being tried in the wrong fora, not the fora where the contacts are significant, indeed overpowering, like Ibbs and Mullane and Hansberry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.201" offset="6326231">You also run the risk that that forum court being subjected to the normal pressures of judicial administration will have a great tendency to apply its own law, thereby violating the individual's constitutional right to have his property, her property, his claim, her claim adjudicated by a local forum under local law by a local judge before a local jury, unless that person manifests a willingness to accede to the jurisdictional power of another state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.976" offset="6481399">It seems to me that must mean... that must be what this Court means when it persists in the notion that the states are co-equal sovereigns, that territorial boundaries have not been eliminated in this country, that each of the states must acknowledge and respect the rights of the other members of the polity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1615.714" offset="6612324">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please this Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.316" offset="6626744">I still believe, notwithstanding the remarks of my learned colleague, that we live in one nation, and we are one country, and we have many states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.092" offset="6685885">I feel compelled to say, however, that there was an air of divisiveness that I gathered from Professor Miller's remarks; and I think that if it was adopted, namely that there be a reversal of the Illinois Supreme Court's decision, it would have a chilling effect on consumer class actions which I think have been encouraged, certainly as indicated in the Snyder case by this Court, that it be tried in the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.027" offset="6805630">As a matter of fact, in the Snyder case it's very interesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.913" offset="6825170">It was a multi-district or multi-state class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.050" offset="6845650">It involved state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.585" offset="6851815">And we had people, 4,000 shareholders, and they lived in various parts of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.322" offset="6874803">And this Court said that suits involving issues of state law are brought on the basis of diversity of citizenship can often be most appropriately tried in state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.713" offset="6928302">And I suggest particularly under those circumstances and with the Court's statement in Standard Oil in terms of class action being a viable mechanism for the redress of these kind of grievances that with the state directly at the present time, I respectfully submit that the Supreme Court's decision in the State of Illinois should not be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.732" offset="7044390">In fact, it should not be even addressed at this time; because I respectfully submit that there are two very important reasons why the decision of the Supreme Court of Illinois should not be addressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.075" offset="7101755">And that is principally on the basis of rightness for review and on the basis of standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.563" offset="7127773">And with respect to the rightness argument, there's been no deprivation here.</text>

I mean if they thought that Gillette, who as many of them may not know had deceived them with respect to this promotion, was in the United States Supreme Court and arguing that their constitutional rights have been violated because of the lawsuit that's been filed by a similar purchaser in the same position, I think that they would not support that at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="2627.486" offset="10659423">But in terms of the judgment itself, the term that in a judgment defendant must pay, what he faces, what a defendant faces is either staying away and having default judgment against you or coming in to court and being hauled in if you're from a faraway forum, hiring a lawyer and contesting it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.435" offset="10755240">And in International Shoe and other cases of this Court the due process aspect of it was what is fair, what is really fair for a defendant who faces this kind of coercive judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3600.819" offset="14552713">I'd like to make it clear that as of this moment the Illinois decision on all federal questions is final.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.111" offset="14601928">The only thing left open for Illinois at this judgment are Illinois state issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.347" offset="14622826">And as this bench knows--</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="3621.382" offset="14635051">Mr. Miller, let me interrupt you on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.982" offset="14645395">Don't you think that the binding effect of the judgment might be affected by the character of the notice that goes out?</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.619" offset="14667965">Supposing they sent out a notice saying we've got just the title of the case and do you want to opt out, or supposing on the other hand they write a notice that says you might get stuck with costs, you might have to respond to discovery, your maximum recovery is $4.80, and the lawyer is so and so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3648.283" offset="14742571">It seems to me it could make a great deal of difference as to how--</text>

            <label>Mr. Arthur R. Miller</label>
            <text syncTime="3650.466" offset="14751348">--It can, Your Honor, but let me back up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3652.485" offset="14759394">There are at least three levels of potential collateral attack that Gillette must face unless this issue is resolved, and I think this may tie to some of the thoughts Justice White was expressing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.577" offset="14815818">First, if you do not decide this question now, people will collaterally attack this judgment on the basis of a lack of personal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.450" offset="14855315">Second, no matter what you decide in terms of the power of Illinois to go forward in this action, although that may prevent collateral attack on the personal jurisdiction point, it will not prevent collateral attack if Illinois goes forward on adequacy of representation grounds, Hansberry and Lee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3697.863" offset="14940893">And third, Your Honor, your very point, there's always the potential for collateral attack on a state court judgment based on inadequate notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.219" offset="14986346">That is why we believe we have standing in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3712.789" offset="15000661">In Hanson and Denckla those were the very threats facing the Florida defendants and why they said unless you decide the question of jurisdiction over that Delaware trustee, we are threatened by the potential for collateral attack down the line.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>

            <label>Mr. Arthur R. Miller</label>
            <text syncTime="3733.953" offset="15085297">Those are Gillette's own concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="3736.003" offset="15093448">I believe my learned colleague may have slightly mistook our argument, which is not necessarily a third party standing or surrogate standing argument; that is our concern under Hanson and Denckla.</text>
            <text syncTime="3752.248" offset="15158440">I believe, by the way, that the third party standing argument is available to us since that has always been a rule of prudential administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3762.604" offset="15199923">And I think it's abundantly clear first that we are injured by the assertion of jurisdiction in Illinois; and second, that it is extraordinarily improbable that the third party is going to come in and assert the points that we are asserting at this juncture.</text>
            <text syncTime="3780.416" offset="15271185">I'd like to point out that under the Illinois consumer protection statute the prevailing party secures costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3789.706" offset="15308279">There are no opinions as yet whether that would embrace the ability to assess costs over a non-formal party class member.</text>
            <text syncTime="3802.431" offset="15359165">I think Justice Stevens was getting at the enormous potential difficulties in choice of law problems here for any court that seeks to assert jurisdiction over non-resident, nonvolitional class members and then purports to apply the legal rules of the other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3827.979" offset="15461356">Which legal rules?</text>
            <text syncTime="3829.748" offset="15468462">The fee rules?</text>
            <text syncTime="3831.148" offset="15474104">The prevailing attorney fee rules?</text>
            <text syncTime="3835.652" offset="15492076">Or such rules as are now common in a state like my own, Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3840.437" offset="15511198">In Massachusetts a consumer who feels aggrieved under the Massachusetts statute must write a letter to the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3848.726" offset="15544426">The company is given 30 days to make a reasonable offer of settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3853.780" offset="15564592">If the reasonable offer of settlement is rejected and the case proceeds to trial and the consumer does not prevail to the settlement point, there's no liability for costs or fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3868.623" offset="15623942">Now, is the State of Illinois going to apply that principle, or is the major consumer policy of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts... and I could lists dozens of comparable illustrations... simply going to be ignored as the State of Illinois plays PacMan with its little electronic monster going around the screen gobbling up $7.95 claims saying oh, they're just dots, they're just dots; because that really is what is at issue in this case: whether consistent with interstate federalism you will allow a court with no contacts to do that.</text>
