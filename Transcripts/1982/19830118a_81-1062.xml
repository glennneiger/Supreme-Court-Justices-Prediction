            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="85.451" offset="499708">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="89.495" offset="515800">The claimant in this case arrived in Los Angeles from Vancouver, Canada on September 10th, 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.570" offset="548191">On her Customs form was a question asking whether she was carrying with her more than $5,000 in currency.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.285" offset="587062">That question was answered "No".</text>
            <text syncTime="109.705" offset="596675">During the course of the Customs inspection process she was three times further asked whether she had on her person more than $5,000 in currency and three times denied it.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.825" offset="649129">Because of suspicions of the Customs officers she was searched, and the search revealed an envelope concealed in her brassiere containing $8,850 in United States currency.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.024" offset="709942">It's quite clear that she knew that this money was there, because when the Customs inspector counted the money and erroneously said it's $9,950, she said I know it's less than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.204" offset="766680">Now, the issue in this case is whether the Government... this money was seized, by the way... and the issue is whether the Government was required to bring a judicial forfeiture action promptly following the procedure without regard to the pendancy of any criminal investigation or prosecution, and without regard to the pendancy of an administrative proceeding for possible remission of mitigation of the forfeiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.725" offset="868766">And if there was some improper delay in bringing the action, whether the remedy was to return the money to the claimant despite the fact that she was not injured in any way by the delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.814" offset="917145">Now, in order to place this issue in context for the Court I'd like to describe briefly the Customs forfeiture procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.045" offset="950059">After an item is seized, there is a prompt post-seizure notice given to the... any person who Customs is aware has... may have an interest in the item.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.759" offset="996871">This notice advises them that they are allowed 60 days to file an administrative petition with the Secretary of the Treasury for remission or mitigation.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="217.975" offset="1029785">Mr. Frey, may I just ask, in this description are you describing the procedure under the Bank Secrecy Act or other forfeitures as well?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="224.629" stopTime="238.279">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="224.629" offset="1056430">Well, Customs employs the... the Bank Secrecy Act itself has no procedural provisions, and they employ the general Customs provisions for the administrative remission process.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="238.279" stopTime="245.760">
            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="238.279" offset="1110973">Is... is... is your position that this case is typical of all forfeitures, or do we have a special problem under the Bank Secrecy Act in this case?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="245.760" stopTime="264.300">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="245.760" offset="1140962">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.120" offset="1142320">I think this case is reflective of a general problem that we have had with forfeitures being barred on account of alleged unconstitutional delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.991" offset="1181818">There are some attributes which I'll get to later of the currency statute which make this, I think, a particularly strong case for the Government; but I will come to those.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="264.300" stopTime="269.922">
            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="264.300" offset="1215045">But generally we could consider it pretty much the same as say the seizure of a boat or an automobile and a narcotic?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="269.922" stopTime="331.929">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="269.922" offset="1237511">I don't think there are any material differences, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.233" offset="1250781">Now, the claimants, as I say, are allowed 60 days to file a petition for remission or mitigation, and it's quite clear from the statute that the decision whether to grant remission or to mitigate the penalty involved in a forfeiture is within the essentially unfetterd discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegatee.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.960" offset="1337716">Now, if an administration petition is filed, the practice is not to file a judicial forfeiture action until the administrative petition is decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.377" offset="1375333">If no petition is filed, then the practice normally is to refer the matter promptly to the United States Attorney for judicial action.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.077" offset="1406157">Now, I should point out that under the current statutes, the judicial action is required only where the value of the object to be forfeited exceeds $10,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.821" offset="1465194">At the time of this seizure it was $5,000, I believe, or $2,500.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="331.929" offset="1485569">What justification was presented for remission here?</text>

          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="335.708" stopTime="359.168">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="335.708" offset="1500720">Well, in this case, as I understand it, the claimant asserted that she was not aware of her obligation to declare the money, because she believed that only money that had been acquired abroad would have to be declared.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.606" offset="1580342">I think that was the main reason that she gave.</text>

            <text syncTime="359.168" offset="1594552">That she had carried it from the United States outside and then was bringing it back on the way to Canada, is that--</text>

          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="366.789" stopTime="367.164">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="366.789" offset="1625063">Yes.</text>

          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="367.164" stopTime="368.289">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="367.164" offset="1626526">--That was the only justification?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="368.289" stopTime="653.548">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="368.289" offset="1631019">Well, I... I... actually the appendix does not contain the letter, and I have not read the letter of remission; so that is my understanding as to what her principal justification was.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.706" offset="1676681">But my colleague can perhaps fill that in.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.487" offset="1687862">In any event, if the matter involved is worth less than $10,000, it's disposed of administratively unless the claimant posts a bond for cost to obtain a judicial proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.559" offset="1736136">If it's worth more than $10,000, a judicial action is filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.542" offset="1755989">Now, also the pendancy of a criminal investigation or a criminal prosecution will ordinarily delay both the decision on the remission petition and the filing of the judicial forfeiture action.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.552" offset="1804054">Another point that I think is pertinent is that once the case is referred to the United States Attorney for civil in rem forfeiture proceedings, there is no further processing or entertaining by Customs of an application for remission or mitigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.969" offset="1861733">Now, in most cases the jurisdiction to entertain such application shifts to the Department of Justice, to the Attorney General; and under the regulations, the Attorney General's standards for granting relief are much stricter, he is much less generous in granting relief than the Secretary of the Treasury after there has been a judicial forfeiture proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.678" offset="1960580">In the case of currency seizures it is not absolutely clear and it is not settled whether the Attorney General would have jurisdiction or whether it would stay with the Secretary of Treasury for a mitigation petition because of the wording of the particular statute; but it's not material to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.325" offset="2043127">Let me also say a word about the substantive standards for currency forfeitures.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.916" offset="2061517">31 U.S.C. 1102... and I am told this has been recently recodified, and I don't have the section number... requires only two things: that there has been transportation in or out of the United States of currency or monetary instruments in excess of $5,000, and that they have not been declared.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.721" offset="2144795">Any currency so transported and not declared is forfeitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.250" offset="2166843">There is no requirement for a civil forfeiture that the person knew or understood that he or she was under a duty to make this report.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.012" offset="2205922">There may be a requirement that they had to know that they were in fact carrying the money on their person, but that's not in question in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.836" offset="2241240">Now, this is in contrast to the criminal prosecution for this violation which would have an element of willfulness which the lower courts have construed to require knowledge of the reporting requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.472" offset="2287738">Let me go briefly through the procedural chronology of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.284" offset="2302993">The seizure occurred on September 10th.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.907" offset="2313546">A remission petition was filed on September 28th of 1975, and on October 20th the case was assigned to a Customs agent for investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.592" offset="2352208">Between October 1975 and April 1976 her investigation largely focused on whether the money that was being transported by the claimant and was not declared was being used as part of some criminal activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.724" offset="2416782">This, I am told, is a standard practice in currency seizure cases, and one of the reasons this, apart from the fact that there is commonly such an association and the discovery of the money may be a lead to uncover other criminal activity, is that the decision whether to prosecute as a misdemeanor or a felony may depend on whether the money was being transported in connection with some other criminal activity, in which case a felony is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.212" offset="2538722">In May of 1976 the case was referred for prosecution to the United States Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.491" offset="2563800">An indictment was returned on June 15th of 1976, and it contained both a misdemeanor count charging the failure to declare the currency and a felony count for false statements to the Customs officer denying the possession of $5,000 during the interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.952" offset="2637674">The trial was held in December of 1976, and at the conclusion of the trial the jury convicted respondent or claimant of the false statement counts and acquitted on the felony transportation... on the misdemeanor currency transportation count.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.959" offset="2725654">Subsequently on her appeal the false statement counts were reversed because of inadvertent leaving of the court file in the jury room.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="653.548" offset="2772048">What is the statute governing the... the statutory section governing the false statement count?</text>

            <text syncTime="657.984" offset="2789811">1001, 18 U.S.C. 1001.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.186" offset="2802663">Now, following this, approximately three months after the verdict in the criminal case the remission petition was denied, and the case was referred to the United States Attorney for a judicial forfeiture action which was filed on March 22nd, 1977, approximately 18 months after the original seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.817" offset="2889181">In January of 1978 the district court entered its judgment upholding the forfeiture and holding that the delay in instituting the forfeiture proceeding was reasonable under the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.157" offset="2938500">Somewhat over three years later the Court of Appeals decided the appeal, held that the Government took too long in filing the judicial forfeiture action.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.917" offset="3001507">Their holding is summarized at page 4A of the appendix to the petition for writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.023" offset="3034004">And the court said,</text>
            <text syncTime="719.757" offset="3036929">"The administrative or criminal investigations cannot justify the Government's delay when the necessary elements for a forfeiture were established at the time of the seizure. "</text>
            <text syncTime="728.534" offset="3072038">And then went on to hold that prejudice is irrelevant to the claim, and without regard to prejudice the claimant is entitled to a return of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.811" offset="3113102">Now, in order to sustain the judgment of the Court of Appeals, claimant must persuade the Court to find in its favor on three issues, each of three issues.</text>

            <text syncTime="828.262" offset="3470875">Congress decided as a matter of policy not to permit it.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.995" offset="3485818">As far as the Tucker Act was concerned, that was an issue that was involved in the Hatzlatch case.</text>

            <text syncTime="847.583" offset="3548198">I should say that under the Department of Justice's procedures, any adverse decision in one of these forfeiture cases is supposed to be reported to the Solicitor General's Office for a decision whether or not to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.937" offset="3597622">And I, apart from this delay issue that is before the Court today, the due process issue, I don't see more than half a dozen a year.</text>

            <text syncTime="874.807" offset="3657076">In any event, in order to sustain the judgment of the Court of Appeals, the first thing that claimant must convince you of is that there exists a general due process requirement of prompt filing of a judicial action following a seizure of goods for forfeiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.097" offset="3730219">Secondly, they must persuade you that due process does not allow the Government to defer such a filing on account of the pendancy of a criminal investigation or prosecution or an administrative petition for remission or mitigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.950" offset="3781628">And thirdly, they must persuade you that the proper remedy for any violation of due process involved in failing to file promptly enough is automatic denial of the forfeiture, wholly without regard to whether the claimant suffered any injury whatsoever by virtue of the impermissible delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.678" offset="3852577">I'd like to first make a couple of preliminary observations.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.519" offset="3867937">The first one is apparently a somewhat old-fashioned idea that's gone out of favor with some of the lower courts, and that is the statute of limitations that Congress enacted governing the time within which actions of this sort must be brought, which is five years.</text>

            <text syncTime="1487.091" offset="6106213">But that's pretty far... I don't see that as a factor that ought to influence the decision on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.167" offset="6126588">Now, let me point out that the claimant in this case has never asked to have a judicial proceeding brought, and she had good reasons for not asking because the judicial proceeding would have been an open and shut, cut and dried case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.787" offset="6188969">She would have lost; she had no defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.957" offset="6197746">Her explanations, her excuses for her behavior are things that could be considered in the administrative remission proceeding, but would not avail her in the least in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.124" offset="6242363">Now, this is generally true in all of these forfeiture delay cases that I have seen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.199" offset="6274650">The last thing the claimant wants is the prompt filing of a judicial action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.369" offset="6291369">They just want to complain after the... if remission has been denied that the action hasn't been prompt enough at a point where the filing of the action can no longer hurt them or it's actually occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.178" offset="6338598">I wanted to clarify one other point before I got into more substantive matters, and that is there's been some discussion about the difference in the meaning of forfeiture statutes that say "shall be forfeited" and "subject to forfeiture".</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.905" offset="6397530">And just yesterday it came to my attention that there is a House and a Senate report that you should look at which explain the view of Congress in 1935 at least, that the "subject to forfeiture" language means the title vests in the United States for the purposes of this relation back doctrine at the time of the seizure, whereas "shall be forfeited" means that title vests at the time of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.801" offset="6505050">In either case there would be no difference for this purpose of the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.268" offset="6522918">This is H.R. Report 868, 74th Congress, First Session, page 11; and Senate Report 1036, 74th Congress, First Session, page 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.246" offset="6574849">I see my time is running short.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.058" offset="6586134">I just want to make the point that due process requires an opportunity to be heard in a meaningful time, and in deciding whether the prompt filing of a judicial action is necessary to provide such an opportunity, you do have to look at what the options are that are available to the rare claimant who might actually want the prompt filing of a judicial action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.612" offset="6672338">First of all, he cannot file or withdraw his administrative remission petition which will normally produce the prompt judicial filing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.201" offset="6710686">Secondly, if he claims that the seizure itself was unlawful, the Rule 41(e) remedy for return of property is available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.557" offset="6744123">Now, this is significant because the class of cases that we're talking about here in terms of assessing the risk of error in determining what process is due is the class of cases in which the items were seized with probable cause to believe that they were subject to forfeiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.348" offset="6811310">In that class of cases the risk of error is very slight.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.862" offset="6825311">This is especially true in these currency cases, because all you need to prove is events that happened right there in front of the Customs inspector: the discovery of the money and the fact of nondeclaration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.217" offset="6866689">So the risk of error in this class of cases is very small.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.918" offset="6885498">Finally, there is the equitable action.</text>

            <text syncTime="1694.070" offset="6934190">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.428" offset="6947564">The first question, as to whether or not the due process clause requires a prompt post-seizure hearing and as to whether or not the statute of limitation is the only limitation of the Government, first of all, 19 U.S.C. Section 1621, which is the applicable statute of limitations, says that the action must be instituted within five years after the time when the alleged offense was discovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.794" offset="7033037">Obviously, if the Government believes that a crime has occurred or that a forfeiture is appropriate and they do not seize the person's property, they have five years within to bring an action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.290" offset="7075042">That's the normal statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.570" offset="7084133">However, when they have seized the property... and this Court has already indicated in the Pierson Yacht case in 1974 that once an item has been seized under a forfeiture proceeding, there is an emergency reason not to comply with the normal rule that before seizure you are to give a person notice and a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.563" offset="7160097">It's only in the rare instance where because of other governmental interest such as in the Pierson Yacht case or potentially in this case that you can seize the property and merely postpone the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.668" offset="7200534">And once the event has happened, there is no reason to delay the hearing beyond the requirement of the due process prompt hearing requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.039" offset="7234075">And I believe the Government has cited no cases, and there are no cases, either at the District Court, Court of Appeals, or Supreme Court that says the Government has up to the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.286" offset="7275035">The rule has always been that once the property is seized, you are required to give a prompt post-seizure hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2672.192" offset="10846601">There's a Section 31, U.S.C. Section 1103, and also the recent Ninth Circuit case decided in October of 1982, which is 295 Ivory Carvings, that says besides forfeiting the item, another alternative is for the Secretary to assess a fine against the offender and assess that fine giving credit for any amount of... the amount of the forfeited item.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.165" offset="10962480">So if, for instance, the Government delays in bringing the forfeiture action and loses the ability to forfeit that particular item, they can obtain the same result by filing an action under 31 U.S.C. 1103 getting a judgment for the amount that they believe is owed to the Government and collect that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.017" offset="11041893">And that only has to be done within the five year statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.171" offset="11054536">But if the Court permits or reverses the Court of Appeals judgment in this case, they're going to say to the Government you can take somebody's property, they can deal with you in an honest fashion, they can ask for prompt action within the remission procedures, they can rely upon your representation the remission procedures are what you are considering, they can hold that property for an indefinite period up to five years, and there's nothing you can do to complain about it, unless you want to take the expense of filing, which seems to be the only potential remedy, an action against the Government saying file a forfeiture action against me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.640" offset="11204479">And why at that time the Government would then make the same arguments: well, we don't have to file a forfeiture action against you because there's a pending criminal matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.950" offset="11233631">I would doubt very much if any members of this audience, or as obviously by the opinions of the Court of Appeals, would countenance the ability of the Government to seize somebody's property and hold it for five years and give them no relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="2804.842" offset="11377200">--Lovasco was a pre-indictment situation, and the Court, to give a little summary, has basically said nobody has a right to be arrested or indicted; that basically it's a prosecutorial discretionary decision as to when to proceed with a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.711" offset="11444701">And since nobody is under any deprivation of any kind, we can't say that you have to file a case within a particular period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.722" offset="11480750">And in order to show a violation under Lovasco, you must show actual prejudice, because until you can show actual prejudice, the Government has done nothing to deprive you of anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.124" offset="11526412">If we were going to use an analogy to any of the prior decisions, obviously the Barker case, Barker v. Wingo, is more applicable because we can analogize the seizure of property to the seizure of a person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.040" offset="11582000">In actuality, forfeiture sections are considered in rem proceedings, so it's an arrest of the property as an arrest of the person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.615" offset="11616378">So once there's been a deprivation, as in this case, now the mechanism similar to a speedy trial application in Barker takes place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.892" offset="11649396">And in Barker there were four specific tests to determine whether or not something was speedy, which is the same kind of determination on an ad hoc basis that should be made as to whether something is prompt... a balancing of factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.841" offset="11697253">And the court in the Ninth Circuit has balanced those factors and said, for instance... and the Government again concedes in its brief that the 18-month period... and I believe I can give you the page citation... is on its face not prompt or sufficiently stale to trigger the other decisions or the other factors in Barker v. Wingo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.425" offset="11791607">So the first factor, of course, is the length of delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.047" offset="11818043">The second factor is whether or not there is any reason for the delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.623" offset="11836329">In this particular case the Court of Appeals found as a matter of law that there were no reasons for the delay because the delay had nothing to do with the ostensible purpose for seizing the funds which was the forfeiture action, the remission petition procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="2948.378" offset="11951372">The reason prejudice is so important in the criminal area is because if the Government loses, it's the end of the matter; the person is free.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.764" offset="11988884">Now, first we have the higher potential society responsibility to prosecute criminals, and when we start letting people that may have committed crimes go, we want to be very careful that there's been a substantial violation of constitutional right before we do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.851" offset="12049279">Second of all, as I've already indicated, in the criminal area if the Government loses, it loses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.068" offset="12078118">There's nothing further they can do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.443" offset="12083656">In the forfeiture area if the Government loses under this procedure, they haven't... they have other remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.798" offset="12117093">They can bring a criminal action, which they did in this case, or they can sue under 1103.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.859" offset="12137259">So their prejudice, if we're balancing prejudice to the Government versus prejudice to the claimant, the Government suffers almost no prejudice whatsoever if they don't bring the forfeiture action promptly because they have another alternative.</text>
