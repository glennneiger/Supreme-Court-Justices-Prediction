            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="149769">We will hear arguments next in Planned Parenthood Association of Kansas City, Missouri against John Ashcroft, Attorney General of Missouri, and the related case.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.275" offset="210791">Mr. Susman, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="frank_susman" startTime="41.281" stopTime="266.938">
            <label>Mr. Frank Susman</label>
            <text syncTime="41.281" offset="314863">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="44.279" offset="326879">We are here today on a case that the Eighth Circuit decided exactly one year ago today.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.449" offset="355509">Restrictions in question here, like all legislative abortion restrictions, adversely and disproportionately affect minors and indigent women who frequently lack the maturity, education, sophistication and financial resources to overcome the additional legislative hurdles placed in front of them while seeking to exercise some reasonable control over their reproductive functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.983" offset="469612">There are basically only four of the restrictions at issue here today before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.387" offset="495317">There were many others decided by the district court, and some of those were not appealed to the court of appeals; there were others that were appealed to the court of appeals and were not further appealed to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.821" offset="537008">Those four issues involve minors, the in-hospital provision after 12 weeks, the requirement of two doctors being in attendance when an abortion is performed on a viable fetus, and lastly, a requirement that pathology be done by a certified pathologist on all specimens regardless of the length of pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.531" offset="619869">Before addressing those four issues, though, I would be remiss if I did not respond in part to the argument and to the brief of the Solicitor General, which brief was jointly filed in this case as well as in the Akron case, although his argument was solely taken during the time of the Akron matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.726" offset="696669">It seems that his brief... and as supported by his oral argument and he so states on page 3 of that brief... that the primary underpinning of his argument is, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="149.268" offset="746824">"that the legislature has superior factfinding capabilities. "</text>
            <text syncTime="153.515" offset="763751">I would submit to this Court that that is absolutely not true; that at best, it is fallacious and at worst it is probably naive.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.153" offset="802308">Initially, at least certainly in Missouri and with all other state legislatures with which I am familiar, the assignment as to which committee any particular piece of legislation goes has a lot to do with whether those in power in that particular legislative body desire that piece of legislation to pass or to fail.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.100" offset="878167">And secondly, the factfinding that goes on, if any,... and very little goes on in Missouri, and I have attended many of these legislative findings in these various pieces of legislation, not only in this case but in the Danforth case... they are not open hearings, they are not hearings that invite an unbiased, an impartial and a fair hearing of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.823" offset="964998">Frequently, speakers only on one side of the issue are asked to attend, and there certainly is no great factfinding ability that would be superior to the type of hearing that goes on in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.710" offset="1012541">Particularly the type of open hearing, unbiased hearing, that went on in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.740" offset="1032708">As the Court is aware in this case, it was not just one, but there were two district court trials because certain issues the appellant court felt, and particularly in regard to the in-hospital issue, had not been fully decided as to the necessary facts that needed to be resolved, so said the Eighth Circuit, and so it was remanded to the district court for a second trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.075" offset="1114001">In addition, I would suggest the bootstrap argument also suggested by the Solicitor General that appears on page 9 of his brief, that legislatures fully take into account all of the constitutional implications of those enactments which they pass judgment on because of the fact that they all take an oath to uphold the Constitution, which we are here today discussing, is awesome.</text>

            <text syncTime="271.266" offset="1234791">It is not startling, but I do not feel that they accurately do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.344" offset="1247121">If, in fact, they did, these cases would not be here today.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="278.747" offset="1264675">Well, that's one of these generalizations which has the value of many generalizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.932" offset="1297485">But we have said as much in a number of our opinions.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="frank_susman" startTime="289.805" stopTime="307.548">
            <label>Mr. Frank Susman</label>
            <text syncTime="289.805" offset="1308979">--Yes, you have, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.570" offset="1315980">But the fact that they may, even... although unintentionally, not pay the proper price for the Constitution is the reason that the cases are brought, and often successfully.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.191" offset="1358507">Because they have avoided or ignored or not correctly applied that oath which they have taken.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="307.548" offset="1379927">Do you think that, say a judge of the court of appeals who takes an oath to follow the Constitution who writes an opinion that is reversed by this Court is not being faithful to his oath?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="frank_susman" startTime="317.654" stopTime="770.674">
            <label>Mr. Frank Susman</label>
            <text syncTime="317.654" offset="1420365">No, I think he's being faithful to the oath if he intentionally tries to apply it to the best of his or her ability.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.667" offset="1440427">I think the suggestion of heavy deference to the legislative judgment on policy issues, which is suggested very strongly by the Solicitor General... and in those cases that he suggests of different segments of society have strongly competing views is a terrifying thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.050" offset="1513883">The entire concept of fundamental basic rights is sought to be undermined and discarded in one fell swoop.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.969" offset="1545544">Constitutional rights will then be bargained by lobbying interests in the legislature, and woe be it to the minority who seek to rely on basic equality, justice and decency for their protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.729" offset="1592669">A comment by Justice Blackmun, as to whether or not Roe versus Wade or Marbury versus Madison was being sought to be overruled I think is apropos.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.647" offset="1632270">If one is to adopt the suggestions of the Solicitor General, 179 years of constitutional history would appear to fly out the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.003" offset="1665707">I would suggest lastly in this regard that the government's somewhat simplistic suggestion of how to resolve this matter and how to avoid any further abortion cases coming before this Court creates more problems than it purports to solve.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.701" offset="1720564">It basically would eliminate the entire concept, in my opinion, of fundamental rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.856" offset="1737178">The first issue that I would wish to address in our chapter, in our section that was passed, is the issue of the minors.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.228" offset="1770615">I would somewhat simplify this particular argument by noting that with two possible exceptions, it is a question of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.739" offset="1812724">Those two exceptions would be whether or not this act does require or insure that appellate review be swift and complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.203" offset="1854520">Respondents take the position that since this statute was enjoined the day following its enactment, the day following it went into law, since it has never been in practice in the state of Missouri, that the Supreme Court of the state of Missouri has waited to enact any rules covering appellate review in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.899" offset="1929335">I don't know and would not speak to the reason they have waited.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.475" offset="1947620">It is clear that in the three years since the statute has been on the books that no rules have been adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.129" offset="1970190">But again, in all candor, the statute has never been in effect to this date.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.940" offset="1985446">The second exception that I would raise in addition to the statutory construction problem on this issue of the minors is that the statute makes absolutely no exceptions whatsoever for any emergency of any kind, even when life or health is threatened.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.402" offset="2063291">Under all possible scenarios, it is necessary that the minor, if she cannot obtain the permission of one parent, go to the juvenile court and go through this hearing and any subsequent appeals that might come along the way, and receive the court's sanction for this procedure, regardless of the fact that her life or health is immediately being threatened by the fact that the doctor cannot perform the abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.874" offset="2177185">And yet, it is interesting to note that Section 3 of this same statute makes an exception of this very like kind when it is necessary to perform an abortion against the minor's will.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.666" offset="2224414">It says if an abortion is necessary to save the life of the minor, and she doesn't want it and she says no, then the doctor may proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.209" offset="2270598">But not the reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.694" offset="2276450">If she wants the abortion and her life or health is threatened, he cannot proceed until he receives, again, the sanction of either one parent or the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.283" offset="2318873">With those two exceptions, then, we are back to the statutory construction problem of Section 188.028.2(4).</text>
            <text syncTime="552.716" offset="2360564">The district court found that the state had not made any argument to convince it that its interpretation of that statute was clear, that the use of this conjunctive word "or" between the options available to the juvenile court of a, b or c, the court had the option to pick any of those, and not necessarily in any order and not necessarily by rejecting others first.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.504" offset="2455754">The appellate court disagreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.097" offset="2462128">It came to an opposite conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.173" offset="2474458">We have suggested in our Reply Brief recently filed with this Court that in light of the difference of opinions of reasonable judicial minds, that perhaps this Court should abstain from the issue inasmuch as a decision by the Missouri state courts would, in fact, or could possibly resolve any federal constitutional question as to what, in fact, the statute does mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.101" offset="2574141">There has never been an opportunity for the Missouri state courts to rule on this issue, and perhaps abstention is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.223" offset="2598592">Abstention, in an identical type of situation, was the route taken by this Court in 1976 in Bellotti 1, and that position of abstaining in that kind of an issue was recently affirmed in H.L. versus Matheson in referencing Bellotti 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.451" offset="2663480">The second matter that we would address is the in-hospital provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.556" offset="2695976">This provision probably has the most serious impact upon the actual delivery of abortion services than any of the other provisions involved before this Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.270" offset="2750833">And probably in the other cases as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.394" offset="2759297">It is clear that this provision would stop and prevent more procedures from taking place, than any of the other provisions involved or under review.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.109" offset="2806109">As Justice Rehnquist indicated in the Themopolous case, it is the practice of this Court to take the factual findings of the lower courts as they find them.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.684" offset="2848427">This case is unique in regard to the in-hospital provision, as opposed to any of the other district courts that have decided this issue, and there have been many.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.243" offset="2882700">This issue has been decided by the District Court in Louisiana, in Kentucky, in Missouri and very recently and unreported yet, in the last two weeks, by courts in Illinois and Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.003" offset="2933691">All have found that this is an unreasonable regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.329" offset="2955007">There were two separate district court trials on this issue, as I indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.390" offset="2971307">And in fact, the trial on remand, the second district court trial,... and it was specifically remanded for this particular issue because the appellate court said, we want to know specifically whether or not it is safer to perform second trimester procedures in a hospital or in an outpatient facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.258" offset="3046749">And while the district court had held the section unconstitutional, they had not in so many words made that factual finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.489" offset="3075692">And when it was sent back on remand and the second trial was held, respondents chose not to offer any testimony whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.736" offset="3100665">And the only additional witnesses at the trial on remand were those offered by the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.874" offset="3121250">The district court made some very specific findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.794" offset="3136923">These are all contained in the Joint Appendix and the various opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.215" offset="3150611">They found, as a matter of fact, that the D&amp;E procedure is the safest second trimester abortion technique currently available.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.744" offset="3184675">They found that second trimester D&amp;E procedures are currently performed in only one hospital in the entire state of Missouri, that being in Kansas City, Missouri which is on the western border.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="770.674" offset="3232427">Mr. Susman, where are the findings on remand?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="frank_susman" startTime="773.502" stopTime="948.963">
            <label>Mr. Frank Susman</label>
            <text syncTime="773.502" offset="3243712">These are all in the Joint Appendix on pages 12 through 14... actually, 12 through 14, and then the same findings by the appellate court, or additional findings, are found on the Cross-Petition at A61 and A116.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.636" offset="3324273">The district court went on to find that in the last final year, when only hospitals could perform abortions in Missouri... that being 1979... that 540 second trimester D&amp;E procedures were performed.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.252" offset="3402745">The district court ruled on this issue in January of 1980 and so it's fair to compare the year of 1980, if you want to count it as a whole year, in which procedures were available both in the hospital and both outpatient.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.980" offset="3461678">The court found, as opposed to the 540 performed in a hospital when it could only be performed in a hospital in 1979, that in 1980 there were some 1400 second trimester procedures, 700 of which were performed in hospitals and 690 in outpatient facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.893" offset="3541299">And so what is clear is when the outpatient facilities began to do them, they did not draw from the patient population of the hospitals who had been doing them previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.203" offset="3582572">What they did, in fact, was merely help to fill a certain portion of the unmet need for second trimester procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.856" offset="3617158">They were not taking patients from the hospitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.401" offset="3627294">In fact, as Dr. Henshaw testified, who is a national expert on the issue of these types of statistics, that Missouri in 1979, again with only hospitals to perform these procedures, was only meeting 13 percent of the unmet need for second trimester procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.175" offset="3698451">And in 1980, when both hospitals and outpatient facilities could perform them, the unmet need went from 13 percent of the met need up to 34 percent; still leaving some 66 percent of the second trimester need unmet in Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.528" offset="3767833">The court also found that there was substantial interference.</text>

            <text syncTime="1432.738" offset="5880721">Four crucial elements of the state's comprehensive program in relation to that abortion regulation framework are before the Court today; the second trimester hospitalization requirement, the second doctor requirement for abortions of viable, unborn children, the consent provision for minors, a pathology requirement, and these are to be considered in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.713" offset="5968597">The proceedings before the trial court and the Circuit Court of Appeals were basically a legislative process assessing the wisdom of the Missouri enactments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.692" offset="6016453">It's clear, inasmuch as the enactments have never been in place, they were enjoined, all of the sections that were challenged were enjoined within 24 hours after they went into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.765" offset="6064727">The trial objections made by the state relating to standing and ripeness were brushed aside as the district court plunged headlong into its assessment of expert witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.729" offset="6112584">So this is a case where we are assessing an uninterpreted, unenforced statute, but a statute which is alleged to be one which is infirm and unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.648" offset="6152290">As a result of both the trial and appeal of this case centered on policy-related testimony regarding what can best be characterized as a significant debate within the medical profession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.033" offset="6209864">This effort really replicated what a legislative process should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.952" offset="6229508">The legislature had drawn conclusions about that debate when it enacted the statutes earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.449" offset="6255526">Of the four abortion matters raised in this Court, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals substantially agreed with the legislative judgment of the Missouri legislature on the consent issue relating to minors, and overruled the Missouri legislature on the other issues, the issues of a second trimester hospitalization, a second doctor in the event of the abortion of a viable, unborn child, and a requirement for pathology.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.096" offset="6358135">The requirement for hospitalization for abortion procedures conducted after the 12th week of pregnancy was ruled unconstitutional below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.842" offset="6397109">And I believe that the district court and the Eighth Circuit Court of appeals erred in so doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.980" offset="6425635">The basic premise I believe that we can understand from Roe versus Wade is a premise that the state has an interest in guarding and protecting the health of individuals; and secondly, that the state can regulate to protect that interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.409" offset="6495330">I think given that interest and the ability of the state to regulate, most states would accept that responsibility and so do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.375" offset="6531170">The problem that we see is that regulation is impossible if this Court is to retreat from the bright line drawn in Roe where it divided the time of a pregnancy into areas when the state could exercise its judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.164" offset="6594386">If, indeed, the courts are to pursue the latest statement of the medical society or even a vocal minority of individuals in the medical community, to change what is allowable in terms of state statutes, I think we'll find states in an impossible position; not only impossible in terms of ever making judgments which can withstand tests, but we'll be finding ourselves here over and over again relitigating issues over and over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.809" offset="6716953">Roe clearly set forth some guidelines, and I urge this Court not to retreat from its indication that there are certain specific times in which the state should be able to rationally regulate in relation to the compelling interests of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.394" offset="6795320">I believe that there is clear evidence in the record of this case that the state can rationally conclude that the facilities available in hospitals are reasonably related to the objective of the preservation and protection of maternal health.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.731" offset="6868672">I believe that the record in this case supports the concept that the state can rationally conclude that a second doctor at the abortion of a viable, unborn child is rationally related to the state's separate and distinct interest in the potential life of that child.</text>

            <text syncTime="2155.259" offset="8770804">There was an overwhelming consensus among the medical experts at trial that the vast majority of abortions in post 12-week pregnancies belonged in the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.160" offset="8818347">Some of the record is confusing because the Center for Disease Control statistics reflect what are known as weeks of gestation rather than weeks of pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.702" offset="8864531">Weeks of gestation are counted from the last menstrual period, and according to Dr. Cates, who is the Chief of Abortion Surveillance there, you have to subtract two weeks from any of their statistics in order to find out what the real impact is on weeks of pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.759" offset="8920747">The only disputed area really is early trimester D&amp;E abortions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2237.397" offset="9099320">Now, Dr. Cates of the Center for Disease Control, who was the most experienced of the witnesses testifying in behalf of the plaintiffs, indicated that at the end of the 15th week, which would be the end of the 13 week in pregnancy terms rather than gestational terms, that hospitalization would be appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.280" offset="9182807">I think what we're talking about in those kinds of circumstances when you put him in conjunction with the expert witnesses of the state, is an overlap perhaps of about seven days.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.446" offset="9227529">It's important also to note some other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.055" offset="9237978">Of the 45 percent of the death cases that Dr. Cates investigated, indicated that the physician had made a mistake of at least four weeks in judging the fetal age before performing the abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.174" offset="9298373">And as a matter of fact, the Center for Disease Control statistics are all arrived at after the fact of the abortion through post-abortion techniques.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.249" offset="9334736">I don't think it's unreasonable at all, if we're talking about an aperture of seven to maybe 14 days early in the second trimester, to give the state the right to demand a margin of safety inasmuch as doctors who are making the evaluations about whether or not they're to conduct the abortion in a hospital or not are frequently involved in having difficulty estimating the fetal age in the pre-abortion context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.051" offset="9433896">After the abortion, it's clear that the fetal age is easier to estimate, but that certainly doesn't leave us with much leeway or much protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.267" offset="9466811">I think the point that I would like to make is that there is a medical debate about a small fragment of second trimester abortions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.402" offset="9507353">That medical debate relates to early D&amp;E procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.776" offset="9524802">Some would say that those go to the end of the 15th week of gestation or the end of the 13th week of pregnancy, as Dr. Willard Cates does, or some would carry it as far as the district court found.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.708" offset="9584571">In the situation where there is a medical debate that rages, and there are significant medical experts and credible individuals who will testify that they all belong in a hospital in the second trimester, and there is a debate relating to just a small aperture and just a narrow portion of procedures, I think the state ought to have the ability to opt as a policy to require second trimester hospitalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.759" offset="9692718">And I do not believe the technology has advanced to such a degree in relation to this matter as to take us away from the ability of the state in scoring this debate to err on the side of safety, if you will, and require its citizens who choose to have abortions in the second trimester to have them in a hospital setting.</text>

            <text syncTime="2653.543" offset="10763842">There is significant testimony in the record, particularly the testimony of Dr. Elizabeth James who was the Director of Neonatal Intensive Care, a unit at the University of Missouri Medical Center, that indicates that children who leave the environment of the mother at 26 weeks now have a 50 percent chance of survival.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.281" offset="10870840">At 28 weeks, the record in the medical center is a 75 percent chance of survival.</text>

            <text syncTime="2702.695" offset="10960492">First of all, the most important thing for a premature child, a newborn, at that stage of development is that they begin to respirate, and the ability to get respiration going is a job which requires the attendance of a physician.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.718" offset="11044607">Secondly, circulation, and she indicated that heart massage may be necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.872" offset="11065191">She pointed to the fact that this is crucial that it be done expeditiously because a failure to respirate can result in neurological damage, so that while a child might survive, it might not survive with the same quality that it would otherwise have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.364" offset="11135199">Given the fact that Roe v. Wade talked about the potential for meaningful life existing, I think when we're talking about that effort to make sure that the respiration is there and we avoid neurological damage is part of it, I believe that we are guarding that adequately.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.044" offset="11209909">The Eighth Circuit struck this down saying that there are occasions when doctors might perform an abortion in the period of viability using the D&amp;E, dilatation and evacuation, technique.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.944" offset="11269469">That technique, concededly, if it's carried through, will destroy the fetus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.925" offset="11297367">It dismembers the fetus, usually especially as in larger fetuses which you would expect at late times in development, as it withdraws the fetus from the environment of the mother, and I think it's clear that that fetus is not going to survive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.795" offset="11360897">It was thought then that this statute be overbroad because we required it in all abortions pursuant to the determination by the physician of viability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.398" offset="11411261">I don't believe that it is so overbroad and I don't believe it is infirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.115" offset="11426203">And the court in Beal versus Doe indicated that it's not until the time of viability that the state has the right to unduly burden the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.938" offset="11473433">But it's pretty clear that in that third trimester there are such strong competing interests that the state indeed has a right to place a heavy burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.857" offset="11509168">Secondly, I don't know that in the hospital context, that a second physician is all that heavy a burden which is imposed in this circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.072" offset="11557965">Thirdly, I think it's important to note that sometimes a decision will be made to use the D&amp;E procedure, and the D&amp;E procedure would not be carried out as a result of complications encountered in the procedure itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.846" offset="11613136">At such time, another procedure might be invoked to complete the surgery, and the potential life should be guarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.000" offset="11641766">Another point that I think ought to be made in relation to the alleged over-breadth of the statute in this context is that when the doctor who is choosing what type of abortion ought to be made is selecting between procedures, his awareness that a second doctor will be involved in the operation I think is a therapeutic influence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.083" offset="11742076">D&amp;E procedures are generally faster and easier to conduct, and the one doctor in this case that testified that he used D&amp;E procedures after viability is the same doctor who testified that he believed that the mother is always entitled to a dead fetus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.468" offset="11807591">And that he would do, and generally did, nothing to try and protect the life of any newborn that was a result of an abortion; that it wasn't his responsibility and he had no interest in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.760" offset="11848760">I don't believe that that's a position which the state of Missouri can accept.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.713" offset="11868613">We believe that that potential for life is valid, that it's real, that it's important and that we ought to protect it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.241" offset="11894631">And as a result, I do not believe that the requirement of a second doctor after viability is an overly-broad requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.141" offset="11942278">It is a safeguard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.422" offset="11947398">It is perhaps burdensome, but it is well justified as a result of compelling interest of the state; that compelling interest of the state being in relation to that potential life of the unborn.</text>

            <text syncTime="3033.872" offset="12285214">That issue is related to the consent provision of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.573" offset="12307993">These consent provisions, in my view, are as close to a direct response to Bellotti 2 as you could possibly get.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.348" offset="12371105">It's almost... well, it's just very interesting that the statute was passed three weeks before the decision, but it's very close.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.735" offset="12408616">If the court has a right to provide the consent absent parental consent, the court is to do that if the plaintiff is not mature enough to make a decision and only if the plaintiff is not emancipated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.042" offset="12473922">The court is to first decide whether or not there's adequate maturity to reach the decision on the part of the minor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.772" offset="12500776">The court secondly is to make a determination as to whether or not the minor is, indeed, emancipated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.364" offset="12523137">And thirdly, the court would provide for consent and is limited to good cause in providing that consent... and good cause are the terms used in the statute... requiring legal grounds to be used for saying if in the event the court determines the statute not to be in the best interest of the minor, those have to be good cause grounds for denying it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.467" offset="12603594">The statute says that the court shall consider the emotional development of the minor, the nature of the abortion, the possible consequences of the abortion, the alternatives to abortion, the intellectual capability and understanding of the minor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.070" offset="12649988">We are asking judges, who are sworn to uphold the Constitution of the United States and who administer the law fairly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.301" offset="12682902">There is an appeal procedure required in statute, and the Supreme Court is directed in the statute, once it's operative, to develop an expeditious appeal in the event that injustice is done there.</text>

            <text syncTime="3321.491" offset="13435647">Secondly, the second underpinning of this Court in Roe versus Wade in the dicta referring to hospitals, was a reference to the American Public Health Association's policy of saying do them in a hospital.</text>

            <text syncTime="3372.564" offset="13639924">In reference to the second doctor requirement, I think we must note that the state was witness for the petitioner, it's true, but it was the state's statistician who, by law, keeps track of all the abortion procedures done in Missouri, that the only form of second trimester abortion in Missouri is the method of D&amp;E.</text>

            <text syncTime="3423.232" offset="13842634">That doesn't answer his argument that the second doctor provides an additional protection against using that procedure when it may not be the appropriate procedure.</text>

            <label>Mr. Frank Susman</label>
            <text syncTime="3432.118" offset="13878161">That second physician, while they might have some idle conversation, has no direct say in that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.317" offset="13910971">They are not the surgeon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.567" offset="13915986">And in fact, it is standard policy, and there was evidence at the trial to this effect, that when you have a second physician present, such as at a large university medical setting and you have a premature delivery, that the second patient, the child, once it is born, does not become the patient of the neonatologist whom you have standing by until such time as that delivering physician, the obstetrician, chooses to turn that child over to the neonatologist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.288" offset="14042837">It is his decision when that turning over of that second patient who has come into existence occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.864" offset="14073139">He must turn the patient over.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.660" offset="14088394">Merely being there accomplishes nothing, particularly when in fact, no procedure is being done in Missouri that would permit such a survival.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.173" offset="14122458">We think the analogy to the prohibition in the Danforth case of the saline procedure is identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.902" offset="14161328">The court in that case held... and all of this language is totally analogous here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.883" offset="14185256">You said in 1976 the state would prohibit the use of a method which the record shows is the most commonly used nationally by physicians after the first trimester, and which is safer with respect to maternal mortality than even continuation of the pregnancy until normal childbirth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.815" offset="14248995">And the latest study, which appears in the July issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association by Dr. Cates indicates that abortion is now as safe as childbirth up to the 16th week.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.060" offset="14298001">And moreover, you went on to say as a practical matter, it forces a woman and her physician to terminate a pregnancy by methods more dangerous to her health than the method outlawed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.259" offset="14334781">Everything you said then in Danforth is equally applicable to the provision under consideration here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.148" offset="14354321">The second doctor requirement I think I have discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.177" offset="14374383">I would only refer this Court back to its language of Collati in 1979, in which you said that Roe stressed repeatedly the central role of the physician, both in consulting with the woman about whether or not to have an abortion, and in determining how any abortion was to be carried out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.794" offset="14452855">This standard over the past 10 years has proven itself, I suggest, in exemplary fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.745" offset="14480649">The medical community has distinguished itself by providing abortion services in a safe and disciplined manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.179" offset="14506458">I would disagree with my brother here that there is some great medical debate being waged either in the literature or in the public forums of this country over whether or not it is safe to do abortions outpatient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.065" offset="14554001">There is nothing in the literature to substantiate any such debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.142" offset="14570301">Certainly, they had medical experts at the trial; medical experts who all were morally opposed to abortion, who had never performed an abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.700" offset="14600499">Now, we've already discussed with Dr. Schmidt, a past president of ACOG testified in our trial who also testified in Akron.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.698" offset="14628502">And the only medical expert they had who had experience doing abortions and called by them, Dr. Nathanson, Dr. Nathanson says it's just as safe out of the hospital as it is in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.068" offset="14678030">And he is the only expert they had who had ever done abortions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.800" offset="14696943">Abortion today is the most widely-publicized and scrutinized medical procedure because of all the legal implications, but the delivery of abortion health care in this country has not been found wanting to any degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.700" offset="14756502">Excessive legislation in this field can only produce the very untoward medical and health consequences that the respondents would suggest to you they're trying to prevent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3661.946" offset="14797462">But instead, I suggest to you that the real purpose of all of these statutes and of all of these sections is to thwart the free exercise of the right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3669.396" offset="14827346">It is the very essence of medicine that the physician be able to adjust the course and consequences of treatment to the individual patient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3677.908" offset="14861305">Codifying medicine is the very antithesis of the medical arts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.033" offset="14877815">Women have more rights in the third trimester after viability, for reasons of life or health, than they have under Section 188.028 for minors when even if you're dying, you still have to go to court or get a parent, and there's no exceptions, or you have in hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="3698.524" offset="14943852">There is no emergency exception whatsoever in the in-hospital requirement, either.</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.804" offset="14964959">No exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="3705.491" offset="14971647">You're better off being in the third trimester; at least then you have some hope.</text>
            <text syncTime="3711.348" offset="14995157">Thank you.</text>
