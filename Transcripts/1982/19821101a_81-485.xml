            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="150523">We will hear arguments next in Hillsboro National Bank against the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and the consolidated case.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.260" offset="191483">Mister Stephens, I think you may proceed when you are ready.</text>

          <turn speaker="harvey_b_stephens" startTime="68.440" stopTime="314.276">
            <label>Mr. Harvey B. Stephens</label>
            <text syncTime="68.440" offset="424182">Mister Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="73.436" offset="444244">The question presented in the Hillsboro National Bank case is simply, should payments made to some of the bank's shareholders by a third party be included in the bank's income.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.182" offset="507251">The facts underlying this case are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.462" offset="528358">In July of 1971 the Hillsboro National Bank paid the personal property tax for all of its shareholders, all 149.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.626" offset="588962">This was its custom for a number of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.062" offset="602755">The amount of the tax that was paid was $30,000 approximately.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.373" offset="623966">It was paid out of the general funds of the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.589" offset="632848">In the subsequent year, in its 1972 income tax return, it took a deduction for the amount of the tax that it had paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.836" offset="685824">This deduction was in accordance with the provisions of 164(e) of the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.502" offset="716440">At the time it paid the tax it did not protest the payment of these taxes, as was provided under the Illinois statute, nor at any time thereafter did it ever contest the validity of the personal property tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.808" offset="773700">Prior to the time of the payment of the tax, the people of the State of Illinois had adopted a constitutional amendment that stated that individuals should not pay ad valorem taxes on personal property owned by them.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.740" offset="841410">This constitutional amendment was held unconstitutional by the Illinois Supreme Court in July of 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.474" offset="872339">Consequently, in 1971 personal property taxes were levied against individual and corporate taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.122" offset="906925">Hillsboro National Bank and all the other citizens of Illinois paid a personal property tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.465" offset="928345">This Court in 1973 reversed the Illinois Supreme Court in the case of Lehnhausen versus Lake Shore Auto Parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.009" offset="970559">Now the question was presented to all the county treasurers throughout the state: What do they do with the money that was paid in 1972 for the 1971 taxes?</text>
            <text syncTime="218.049" offset="1022699">The Illinois General Assembly had attempted to solve the problem by passing a piece of special legislation which specifically referred to the pending case in this Court, directed the county treasurers to hold the money in escrow, and following the decision in this Court to either dispense the money to the taxing bodies or to refund that money if the tax was declared invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.820" offset="1129801">This special act was enacted after the Hillsboro National Bank paid the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.363" offset="1171911">It was not on the books and did not exist at the time they paid the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.002" offset="1186435">Some time during 1973 the Hillsboro National Bank... excuse me, the Montgomery County treasurer decided that 132 of the 149 shareholders of the bank were individuals and issued refund checks of the amount of personal property tax directly to the shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.431" offset="1276192">They did not consult with the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.366" offset="1291970">They did not even advise the bank that they were making the refunds or to whom or how they were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.224" offset="1315375">This brings us to the issue before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.427" offset="1332198">Very simply, should these refunds to the 132 shareholders made by the county treasurer, totaling approximately $26,000, be included in the 1973 income of the Hillsboro National Bank.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="314.276" offset="1407535">What about the corporate shareholders?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harvey_b_stephens" startTime="317.853" stopTime="597.803">
            <label>Mr. Harvey B. Stephens</label>
            <text syncTime="317.853" offset="1421850">No, the money was delivered to the taxing bodies because the corporate shareholders were held to be liable for the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.429" offset="1448182">So as far as corporate shareholders, trusts, executors, they made up the other 17 shareholders in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.596" offset="1492903">We are faced then with an application of the tax benefit rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.155" offset="1519130">The tax benefit rule is a judicially created doctrine having its basis in equity and the annual accounting principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.621" offset="1552985">Prior to this case, a case before it in the Seventh Circuit called First Trust, and a case in the Sixth Circuit of Tennessee-Carolina, all of the cases involving the tax benefit rule had three elements to them:</text>
            <text syncTime="373.081" offset="1642846">First of all, a deduction; secondly, a deduction which results in a tax benefit to the taxpayers; and thirdly, in a subsequent year there is an economic recovery which we believe has the effect for tax purposes of increasing the net worth.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.462" offset="1732290">The Commissioner now argues in this Court, though, that this third requirement, that is of an economic recovery, should be ignored and we should substitute a new element, a rather ambiguously stated argument, and I quote from his brief:</text>
            <text syncTime="418.858" offset="1825912">"The premise upon which deduction was taken is no longer valid. "</text>
            <text syncTime="423.981" offset="1846392">In order to get to that result, he relies on three earlier opinions of the Board of Tax Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.868" offset="1885994">Each one of these cases, there is an economic recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.944" offset="1910236">The first case, South Dakota Concrete, involves an embezzlement loss and a deduction for it in year one, the recovery of the embezzlement in a subsequent year.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.862" offset="1957883">The second case, Block, involves a deduction on an income tax return for estate taxes that were paid, federal estate taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.059" offset="2002709">The federal estate taxes were subsequently refunded.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.387" offset="2020054">There was an economic recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.010" offset="2030503">The third case is Barnett.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.243" offset="2043460">It involves the situation where a person leased out some mineral property, they took a depletion allowance against the advance royalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.036" offset="2090585">For tax purposes it was considered that the property had been expended.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.673" offset="2117125">The property was returned to him, the lease cancelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.078" offset="2130814">When the minerals were given back to him, they also received back the depletion allowance.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.341" offset="2151816">Each case, there is an economic recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.324" offset="2171774">In this case, in the Tax Court and in the Court of Appeals they relied on the notion that the taxpayer-shareholders, through some sort of constructive dividend theory, it should be attributed to the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.238" offset="2251395">However, in the briefs in this case the Commissioner now takes the position and urges that even if no one had received a recovery, no one, the Court's decision in Lehnhausen by itself required the inclusion of the tax payments in the bank's income.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.856" offset="2333942">That means quite simply that if the county treasurer did not establish the escrow, but instead immediately distributed all the funds to the taxing bodies and had not established the escrow, so that there was no money to be refunded and no money was refunded, the Commissioner now argues in this Court that because the premise, agreeably and concededly valid, on which the deduction was taken in 1972 has become invalid by subsequent action, that you must restore that income.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.259" offset="2511470">This is contrary, I urge, to the longstanding history of the tax benefit rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="740.043" offset="3110614">As Mr. Stephens has set forth, the tax benefit rule requires that an item properly offset against gross income in determining the true liability for a particular year is includable in the gross income when it is recovered in a subsequent year.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.661" offset="3173099">In effect, there are the three elements, that is: an item that was previously deducted, that resulted in a tax benefit, and it was subsequently recovered in a later year.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.266" offset="3215522">The Government has sought to resurrect the early applications of the tax benefit rule, which held that an end of need constituted a recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.824" offset="3257736">That rule was laid to rest by this Court in the Nash decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.667" offset="3273096">As such, an actual recovery is required for the application of the tax benefit rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.274" offset="3295561">In the case involving Bliss Dairy, there was an amount that was previously deducted by the corporation that resulted in a tax benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.504" offset="3328476">That amount was not, however, recovered during the taxable year in issue as a result of the liquidation of the corporation or, for that fact, ever recovered by the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.454" offset="3372257">The attempt to apply the tax benefit rule to a liquidation under Sections 333 and 336 of the Internal Revenue Code is not only prevented by the concise words of the statute--</text>

            <text syncTime="1437.842" offset="5901850">It's similar to a reverse of incorporation, where stockholders form a corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.856" offset="5925883">They may put in assets that have a very low basis and receive stock having a fair market value equal to the fair market value of the assets that they use for incorporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.492" offset="5976456">They recognize no gain at that time, even though they have received something substantially increased in value, and that's because of the statute involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.878" offset="6013968">If they were to sell their stock, however, the basis in their stock is the same as the basis they had in their assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.296" offset="6043643">Therefore, they would recognize gain based on the difference between the fair market value of the stock and the basis they had in the assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.169" offset="6075199">As a part of the complete view of the transaction, we should examine the statutory pattern of a liquidation under Section 333.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.774" offset="6121592">Again, the purpose of that statute was to allow people to disinvolve themselves with the corporate entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.238" offset="6159418">They had formed a corporation; to allow them to get out of a corporation by distribution of assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.501" offset="6180525">It must also be noted that there is a possibility that they would not have received cash sufficient to pay tax on any gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.217" offset="6215320">So what the statute provides is that upon liquidation, under this type of liquidation, they get the assets out even if they had appreciated substantially in value, but the basis remains the same as the basis they had in the stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.711" offset="6277282">So if there's a subsequent sale, it is that time that the gain is recognized upon the sale of those assets received by the shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.067" offset="6314690">In our instance, these assets were of the type that the shareholder could expense them rather than having to sell them as if they were an asset that was not subject to expensing, because of the type of business they were engaged in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.294" offset="6375607">Reliance by the Government on cases involving liquidations under Sections 331 and 337 is misplaced because those cases do not in fact involve the application of the tax benefit rule to the liquidating distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.802" offset="6457632">They provide for the application of the tax benefit rule to sales made by the corporation prior to liquidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.220" offset="6487307">Under Section 337 there is no gain or loss on sales or exchanges of corporate property that accrue within a 12-month period following the adoption of a plan for liquidation, but prior to the actual liquidating distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.293" offset="6551672">The courts have allowed the application of this tax benefit rule or tax benefit principles even though it is contrary to the specific language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.523" offset="6588557">Basically, I feel they have allowed it because of two things: One, there was an actual recovery in those instances; Two, they have looked to the purpose of that statutory language and held that the purpose of that language was really to prevent the results that occurred under the Court Holding case, rather than to override any type of application of the tax benefit rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.608" offset="6680926">The cases of South Lake Farms and Tennessee-Carolina involved liquidations wherein there was a distribution rather than a sale of assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.231" offset="6707362">While those cases involved similar factual situations, the courts obviously reached a different result.</text>

            <text syncTime="1839.010" offset="7506500">The reason is, and this goes, Justice Blackmun, right to the heart of the tax benefit rule, the problem is the annual accounting concept that was declared in 1931 by this Court in Sanford &amp; Burnett against Brooks, the notion that we do not assess tax on the basis of a transactional approach and wait until all of the assets of the transaction have been finally completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.250" offset="7611512">Rather, at the end of each year we determine, what are the income, what have been the expenses, and then assess the tax within that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.542" offset="7648606">In some instances, however, it later develops that deductions that were taken because of later events we know were not in fact deductions to that taxpayer.</text>

            <text syncTime="2564.406" offset="10408077">Bliss purchased approximately $150,000 worth of cattle feed and claimed a deduction for the full $150,000, on the assumption that the entire amount of feed would be consumed in its business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.026" offset="10454575">In fact, it was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.010" offset="10462516">The reason was, Bliss used only $94,000 worth of the feed in its business because it went out of business before it used all the feed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.208" offset="10503267">We now know what we did not know at the end of fiscal 1973, and that is that Bliss' feed expense, Bliss as a corporation, feed expense for 1973 was not $150,000, it was $94,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.374" offset="10563976">Now, I need to make two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.999" offset="10570454">The first is, Mr. Silhasek is right when he says that there was an allocation of the basis, the shareholders' basis in their stock, among the various assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.305" offset="10631685">I know of no indication in this record as to how much of that basis went to the feed, though that I think is immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.521" offset="10660525">The crucial point, the first aspect of my response, is that insofar as the feed itself is concerned there was a stepped-up basis and that is undeniable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.531" offset="10716636">Insofar as the feed is concerned, the corporation paid for it once and the corporation and the shareholders deducted it twice.</text>

            <text syncTime="2908.142" offset="11783059">But let me get to the 336 argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.000" offset="11790477">Bliss' argument is that once it decided to terminate its business it distributed all of its assets, including the unconsumed feed, to its shareholders in a liquidating transaction governed by Section 336 of the Code, which provides that no gain or loss shall be recognized to a corporation on the distribution of property in partial or complete liquidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.789" offset="11877622">And Bliss' argument is that this statute precludes the application of the tax benefit rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.020" offset="11898520">The fallacy in that argument is that the gain which Section 336 immunizes is a gain from the sale of appreciated assets and, for reasons that are spelled out more fully in our reply brief, particularly the reference to the First Bank of Stratford case in connection with the adoption of the companion provision to Section 336, Section 311, makes very clear that that's the kind of gain to which Section 336 applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.446" offset="12028296">This is also borne out by, interestingly enough, a Ninth Circuit case, the West Seattle case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.505" offset="12044492">The amount which the Commissioner seeks to include in Bliss' income does not result from the disposition of an appreciated asset.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.315" offset="12075734">It was not a gain in the Section 336 meaning of that word.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.580" offset="12092766">On the contrary, the income at issue in this case is the ordinary business income of Bliss' prior taxable period that had gone untaxed as a result of the offset provided by Bliss' cattle feed deduction, a deduction that was based on anticipated expense that Bliss in fact never incurred.</text>
