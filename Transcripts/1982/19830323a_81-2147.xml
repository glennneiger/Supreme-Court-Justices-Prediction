            <text syncTime="49.478" offset="377477">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, during the floor debate on the McCarren Amendment, Senator McCarren stated to Senator Ernest McFarland,</text>
            <text syncTime="59.772" offset="418646">"Let me say to the Senator from Arizona that there is no state in the Union more interested in this bill than is the State of Arizona. "</text>
            <text syncTime="68.752" offset="454486">"In fact, all of the western arid and semi-arid states are interested in this bill. "</text>
            <text syncTime="76.200" offset="484370">Of course, the reason Senator McCarren believed that the State of Arizona was interested in his bill is because as its sponsor he understood that the State of Arizona could utilize his bill for the adjudication of water rights, and yet we are before this Court 30 years later arguing about whether the McCarren Amendment applies to the courts of Arizona as well as the other western states.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.708" offset="586352">These consolidated cases come to this Court on writs of certiorari to the Ninth Circuit, five cases from Arizona and seven cases from Montana.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.733" offset="626476">In Arizona, state general water adjudications had been filed on the five major river systems in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.668" offset="666182">Within a month after service of process on some 12,000 defendants on the Salt River adjudication, five Arizona tribes filed separate actions for removal petitions in federal court, all on the same day, to enjoin any determination of their rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.880" offset="747057">These were not suits to adjudicate water rights, but rather suits to prevent any adjudication of their rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.123" offset="779971">Six weeks later, two other tribes and one in the first group filed separate federal suits to determine their rights only.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.778" offset="810587">None of the federal tribal actions in Arizona have sought a general adjudication of water rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="186.595" offset="925944">This Court held in the Colorado River case that either under Section 1345 or... well, Section 1345 in that case, that a suit could be filed in the federal court for adjudication of water rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="205.648" offset="1002117">For a streamwide adjudication, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.071" offset="1011834">And of course the Court in Colorado River held that the considerations of wise judicial administration that would be applied by the Court would determine whether the adjudication could go forward in the federal court or in the state court if there were concurrent proceedings and concurrent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.422" offset="1077245">The key difference between that case and this case is that there there were general adjudications filed in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.578" offset="1101800">Here, there are none.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.746" offset="1110473">In the state adjudication proceedings that were in the meantime proceeding in Arizona on just the river systems which are before this Court, over 100,000 potential defendants were identified.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.461" offset="1173375">Over 70,000 have been personally served.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.131" offset="1188004">Claims have been filed, almost 7,000 separate claims, approximately one-third of them by the United States itself, and over $2 million has been appropriated to the Department of Water Resources to assist the courts in Arizona to determine these claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="279.322" offset="1296778">The numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.790" offset="1298659">Purely numbers.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jon L. Kyl</label>
            <text syncTime="281.260" offset="1304510">--Simply to illustrate, Mr. Chief Justice, the significant progress and involvement in the Arizona state court proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.414" offset="1337215">If there were federal court general adjudications pending, the Court would under the Colorado River balancing determine which court to send the adjudication to.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.315" offset="1376817">Here there are no federal court adjudications, but I mention it to illustrate the fact that the Arizona proceedings are viable and are proceeding and involve a tremendous number of claims by people on five different water systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.823" offset="1438780">The tribal actions were appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and were argued in conjunction with the seven cases from Montana.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.055" offset="1471694">My co-counsel, General Greely, will discuss the procedural history of the Montana cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.914" offset="1491129">A divided three-judge Ninth Circuit Court reversed the Montana and Arizona cases, holding that the enabling Act and constitutional disclaimers of Arizona and Montana constituted a bar from those states adjudicating water rights held in trust for the tribes by the United States unless the states had accepted Public Law 280 jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.994" offset="1583498">Most, if not all, of the parties here agree that Public Law 280 jurisdiction is irrelevant to these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.728" offset="1614427">The Ninth Circuit also reversed the Montana case on the ground that the district judges there had improperly considered or applied the considerations of wise judicial administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.566" offset="1661761">There was no such finding in the Arizona cases because of the disposition on the disclaimer issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.375" offset="1689033">The United States agrees that the application of the McCarren Amendment is not barred by the disclaimers of Arizona, Montana, and the other western states.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.527" offset="1733650">The respondent tribes, however, continued to read the disclaimers as a bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.840" offset="1750891">I will address that issue first for both Montana and Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.649" offset="1770117">The second and, we believe, primary issue in this case is whether considerations of wise judicial administration counsel deference to the state court proceedings in Arizona and Montana.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.239" offset="1812435">I will discuss the application of those considerations in the Arizona litigation, which we submit presents a much stronger case for state court adjudication than did the facts of Colorado River.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.094" offset="1859873">My co-counsel, General Greely, will address those considerations as to the Montana litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.731" offset="1878473">The disclaimer provisions do not create different law for those eleven states admitted after 1889 than for the states admitted before then.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.744" offset="1918492">Rather, the disclaimers were a response to U.S. versus McBratney, merely intended to confirm the plenary power of the United States government as to Indian tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.944" offset="1963318">There was not in 1889 and there is not today any reason to differentiate between the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.517" offset="1993620">Any such distinction would be purely artificial.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.015" offset="2007622">Congress has made no such distinction in passing laws applicable to all of the states, nor has this Court in interpreting the applicability of laws to... state laws to Indian reservations, and creation of such a distinction today would not only put into question those Acts of Congress, but also the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.493" offset="2093513">As the United States acknowledges, it is too late in 1983 to create a distinction where none has existed before.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.518" offset="2125591">This Court has... That this Court has not read the disclaimer as a bar is illustrated by your decision in Organized Village of Kake versus Egan.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.577" offset="2161849">There, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, for a unanimous court, stated that even though Indian lands in Arizona remained under the absolute jurisdiction and control of the United States, in other words, subject to the disclaimer, the Court had declared in the Arizona case of Williams versus Lee that the test whether a state law could be applied on an Indian reservation was whether absent governing Acts of Congress, the application of that law would interfere with reservation self-government.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.317" offset="2284833">Congress has exercised its absolute jurisdiction and control recognized by the disclaimers by enacting the McCarren Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.467" offset="2325375">That is the governing Act of Congress here.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.575" offset="2337810">It prevents all water rights, including those held by the United States in trust for the tribes, to be determined in comprehensive state court general adjudications.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.149" offset="2384099">In other words, the disclaimer merely acknowledges the right of the United States to pass a law like the McCarren Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.583" offset="2409803">Nor does it require, as the tribes argue, that the states somehow have to repeal the disclaimer, because, as this Court held in Kake, the disclaimer is not inconsistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.249" offset="2468526">The right, or the disclaimer, rather, of all right and title was merely a disclaimer of proprietary interest, not governmental interest, and the acknowledgement in the disclaimers of absolute federal jurisdiction and control remains undiminished, not exclusive federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.006" offset="2551596">This Court's clear and meaningful decision in Colorado River would be trivialized if the Court were now to limit the application of the McCarren Amendment to only four western states.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.345" offset="2608856">The real question in this case, we submit, is the application of the consideration of wise judicial administration to these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.309" offset="2664758">In Colorado River you deferred to the state court proceedings after considering those factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.260" offset="2688582">A fortiori, you should do so here.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.180" offset="2700285">In Colorado River, the most important factor you found was the McCarren Amendment itself, and you held that the McCarren Amendment evinced two clear federal policies; Number One, the avoidance of piecemeal adjudication of water rights, and Number Two, the recognition of the availability of, and later in the Moses Cohn case you said the peculiar appropriateness, of comprehensive state systems for adjudication of water rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.794" offset="2814701">You discussed those two first, the avoidance of piecemeal adjudication is a critical factor here.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.730" offset="2838420">Unlike the facts of the Colorado River case, there are no general adjudications pending in the Arizona federal district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.084" offset="2871857">The Ninth Circuit judge who dissented, Judge Merrill, pointed out that in these cases there would not only be no piecemeal adjudication, there would be no adjudication of water rights at all in the federal district courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.813" offset="2926819">The only adjudication of water rights that can occur in Arizona, the only comprehensive adjudication, is in the state comprehensive adjudication process.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.686" offset="2966316">The second of those two clear federal policies was the recognition of the availability of state courts, comprehensive state proceedings, and the significant administrative assistance given to the state courts through those comprehensive state statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.505" offset="3041549">Just one month ago today, in the Moses H. Cohn case, Mr. Justice Brennan for the Court said,</text>
            <text syncTime="721.533" offset="3065686">"There is an affirmative policy in federal law expressly approving litigation of federal water rights in the state court, the McCarren Amendment. "</text>

            <text syncTime="986.502" offset="4125526">It is not a simple proposition at all, if done correctly, because the reserved right doctrine depends upon the availability of water.</text>

            <text syncTime="1223.920" offset="5075233">That question was argued to this Court in Colorado River.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.638" offset="5086100">It was decided by this Court in Colorado River, where you specifically held that Indian rights could be subjected to state court determination, and that doing so would not imperil those rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.087" offset="5127896">Far from creating more certainty, the government's proposal would raise questions which we believe would plague this Court for years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.785" offset="5158616">It is legally flawed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.630" offset="5166035">It is piecemeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.975" offset="5171469">It is duplicative, wasteful, all of these things we have discussed in our brief in some detail, and this is also true with respect to the tribes' proposals for class action lawsuits, which are an even more piecemeal way of approaching the problem than the proposal of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.952" offset="5235312">This Court, we believe, is faced with a choice, application of its clear and workable holding in the Colorado River decision in forcing the Congressional policy enunciated in the McCarren Amendment, or attempting to fashion a new rule contrary to prior decisions and contrary to the legislative intent of McCarren.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.896" offset="5319113">We urge the Court to reinstate the ruling of the district judge.</text>

            <text syncTime="1317.976" offset="5451397">There were seven cases filed in Federal District Court, six by the United States and one by the Northern Cheyenne Tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.128" offset="5476056">In January, '75, the Northern Cheyenne named 21 defendants and 100 John Does in their action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.409" offset="5505209">The six United States suits were filed at the request of the tribes, including the Northern Cheyenne Tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.516" offset="5537601">In March of '75, the United States, at the request of the Northern Cheyenne Tribe, named 24 defendants and asked for adjudication of all federal and Indian reserve water rights on the Tongue River.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.010" offset="5587547">In April of '75, the United States, at the request of the Crow Tribe, named several hundred defendants on the Big Horn River.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.351" offset="5620879">The four remaining suits were all filed in 1979, and they involved the Flathead River and the northern tributaries to the Missouri River but not the Missouri River itself, and these suits were also filed at the behest of the tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.327" offset="5676781">There has been virtually no progress in any of these federal cases, and all seven of these cases were dismissed by the Federal District Court in Montana in 1979 based on the Akin factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.623" offset="5725996">Now, this is in sharp contrast to the situation in Montana's state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.511" offset="5749611">Montana's state adjudication has been moving very rapidly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.071" offset="5763821">In 1979, pursuant to state law, a statewide adjudication began with regard to all water rights in the State of Montana.</text>

            <text syncTime="1429.306" offset="5896732">By April 30th of 1982, over 200,000 claims to water rights in the states had been filed in the state courts, and anyone who had not filed by that date in the State of Montana are presumed to have abandoned their claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="1517.096" offset="6247922">There was an effort, I believe, on behalf of one of the tribes to stay the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.514" offset="6277597">That motion was... I believe it was in federal court in Missoula, and I think it was agreed that the federal district judge would not stay... try to stay the state proceedings pending the decision of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.540" offset="6325663">Now, in preparation for my oral argument today, I decided to listen to the tape of the oral argument in the Colorado River decision, and I found it to be quite interesting, because I had kind of thought that there wasn't that much discussion of Indian rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.814" offset="6414793">I thought the discussion in that case before the Court in oral argument concentrated on keeping the federal reserved rights in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.546" offset="6445722">But much to my surprise, over 50 percent of the argument that was presented by the Solicitor's Office, Mr. Shapiro, involved Indian water rights, and many of the questions that this Court raised involved Indian rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.539" offset="6497653">The question that appeared in oral argument was whether Indian rights, reserved water rights should be adjudicated in state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.677" offset="6522208">And the arguments in that case echo very much the briefs of the Indian tribes and the United States in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.753" offset="6558571">It is interesting, and I have the brief here from the Colorado River case, and obviously I am not going to read it to you or read great detail from it, but it is... just to give you an idea, with the indulgence, let me just read a couple of the headings here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.965" offset="6615413">"Determination of Indian and federal water claims in federal court will not interfere with state proceedings. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.152" offset="6636102">"Important practical benefits result from water rights suits by the United States in federal courts. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.712" offset="6658358">"Federal decrees can easily be integrated into Colorado's general adjudication. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.630" offset="6678002">"Federal courts alone have jurisdiction over claims for determination of Indian water rights. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.879" offset="6699005">Now, the only reason... the only difference I see between that language and the language in the Solicitor's brief today is that they used the term "integrated" in that brief, that the rights would be integrated in the state proceedings, and the terminology that has been used here is "plugging in".</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.261" offset="6772566">Now, this Court rejected all those arguments in the Colorado River decision, and we are dealing with the same statute, the McCarren Amendment, and this Court has interpreted that in Colorado River, and seven years after the decision in 1976 in Colorado River, Congress has not seen fit to amend that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.237" offset="6856471">I think it might also be important, if I may, to examine the proposal of the Solicitor in this case, the proposal that the Indian rights somehow can be adjudicated separately in a federal court proceeding while all the other rights are adjudicated in a state court proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.588" offset="6929823">This, of course, was the same argument that was made in Colorado River, and this Court has held, as Mr. Kyl referred to in the Cohn case, that clear federal policy of avoiding piecemeal adjudications of water rights in the river system are concerned, and there is a preference for a unitary and comprehensive proceeding in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.767" offset="7010593">And there is good reason, and let me suggest the nightmare that may occur in Montana should we have any kind of a concurrent proceeding in that state ongoing in the same river drainages as the comprehensive proceeding for state water rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.542" offset="7069735">And the government says in its brief that the... the government says in its brief that it, if course, if this Court would hold that Indian rights could be done in federal court, it will go back and amend its complaint, and of course it would have to amend its complaint to put that plug-in plan into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.895" offset="7167119">Under the federal rules, of course, they would have to file a motion to amend, and in the federal cases there are approximately 9,000 defendants, and they would have to be served, and some of those defendants may oppose the motion, some of them may consent to it, and some of them might not even respond, and then there would be hearings on those motions, and if the motion were granted, then the new complaints would have to be filed, and those would have to be served, and really the question is, who would be the defendants in those federal case proceedings when they are supposedly just adjudicating Indian rights?</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.911" offset="7291149">Well, the answer is, in a comprehensive water adjudication everybody would have to be a defendant, whether they had a state right, a federal right, a federal reserved right, or an Indian water right, if... that is, if that decree were to be binding on all the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.890" offset="7351126">And the purpose for all of this, the government suggests, is that the federal courts are the judicial forum or the preferred forum for determining Indian water rights, and Colorado River clearly answered this argument by saying that the Indian rights can be adjudicated in state court just as easily and maybe more easily than in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.959" offset="7443390">Now, there is one other issue that may possibly trouble the Court, and this issue I don't believe was discussed or brought up in the Colorado River decision, and this is the issue that apparently gave some trouble to the Ninth Circuit, and that was the issue of whether or not there was a conflict of interest between the tribes and the United States which apparently occurred for the first time at the Ninth Circuit level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.168" offset="7556239">I don't know that the issue was addressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.601" offset="7565957">It wasn't addressed by the federal district judges of Montana when they dismissed in favor of the state proceedings on the grounds of Colorado River and McCarren.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.944" offset="7603260">And of course as I understand, the government's position is that they don't recognize any conflict of interest in this case or in any of these cases, to my knowledge, that are consolidated here on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.954" offset="7655295">Apparently, the argument, and this is the argument that is made by the tribes, is that the U.S. should not be representing the tribes with regard to their reserved Indian water rights because the U.S. may have some federal reserve water rights that may be in conflict with the tribes' rights if they occur in the same adjudication process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.553" offset="7749754">Of course, that was the exact situation that existed in the Colorado case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.065" offset="7767831">The United States in that case was suing on its own behalf for water rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.081" offset="7783818">I forget the name of the forest on the San Juan River.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.158" offset="7796148">And the Indian tribes were also involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.596" offset="7805865">Their water rights were also involved in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.579" offset="7817882">The United States, while not recognizing any conflict of interest, say that of course they are the trustee for the tribe, and as trustee they have a special obligation to protect those rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.993" offset="7887472">In fact, in the cases in Montana, the tribal rights come first in the order of complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.958" offset="7907325">It doesn't appear that there is any problem with that in the state of Montana, but--</text>

            <text syncTime="2349.209" offset="9576340">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.710" offset="9582401">Now, in this case, there are several statutory and policy reasons why federal courts must or in any event should retain jurisdiction to adjudicate the Indian water rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.094" offset="9623883">I want to discuss two of these important reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.176" offset="9636213">The first is the Disclaimer Act bar, which is an absolute jurisdictional bar in our opinion, and the second is the conflict of interest point, which is certainly a significant factor and, we would claim, decisive factor in the circumstances of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.526" offset="9693578">Before discussing the particulars of the disclaimer, however, I think it is important to keep the big picture in sharp focus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.196" offset="9724298">This is a jurisdictional dispute that directly involves Indian tribes and their most important and precious property right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.632" offset="9754077">At issue are the water rights of the biggest reservations and the largest Indian tribes in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.158" offset="9776125">States are asserting jurisdiction and control over the tribes and their property, matters which are at the very core of the protective relationship between the United States and the Indian tribes, and from which the tribes and their elected officials historically have been excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.763" offset="9842580">The states are claiming this power by virtue of a statute, the McCarren Amendment, that does no more on its face than simply waive the sovereign immunity of the United States in water adjudication suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.070" offset="9895766">It does not mention Indians, Indian tribes, Indian water rights, or Indian reservations, nor is there any evidence in the legislative history of this statute of Congressional concern about such critical matters as tribal sovereign immunity, the federal government's conflict of interest, the state court's traditional hostility to Indians, or the disclaimers of jurisdiction in the enabling Acts and constitutions of the eleven western states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.680" offset="10014257">The petitioners, we submit, are asking this Court to do the work of the Congress by filling in all of these legislative gaps, but the McCarren Amendment is far too slim a reed to carry this immense weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.817" offset="10066815">It cannot sweep everything else aside, especially when effect can be given to its principal purpose as well as other relevant laws, treaties, and national policies, by limiting McCarren's waiver of sovereign immunity to the federal courts in the disclaimer states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.654" offset="10138182">This Court's job is to reconcile and give effect to all of the relevant laws, not to pick one and allow it to ride roughshod over all of the others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.602" offset="10185934">So, the states and the petitioners' submission is fundamentally flawed, because the tribes' position gives effect to the McCarren Amendment in the disclaimer states, and the McCarren Amendment does constitute a waiver of the sovereign immunity of the United States with respect to suits in federal court to adjudicate Indian water rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.436" offset="10281229">It would not eviscerate or eliminate the effect of the McCarren Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.622" offset="10302022">Now, the Colorado River case stretches the McCarren Amendment as far as it reasonably can be extended, but the Colorado River case expressly rejected the argument that the McCarren Amendment divests federal courts of their jurisdiction to adjudicate Indian water rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.925" offset="10379240">While the anti-piecemealing policy that the Court perceived in the McCarren Amendment was held sufficient to justify deference to an ongoing state adjudication in certain very specific and limited circumstances, we submit that much more than that is required to overcome the force of other equally valid federal laws, treaties, and policies that are involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.134" offset="10492089">First, let me speak specifically about the disclaimers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.115" offset="10507971">Under the Constitution, of course, Indian tribes and their property are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.706" offset="10542349">This promise was repeated in numerous treaties between the United States and the tribes, including the Apache and Navajo treaties that are involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.328" offset="10584876">And after this Court's decision in 1882 in the McBratney case cast some doubt on that proposition, it was repeated in the disclaimer provisions in the 1889 Act admitting Montana and three other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.462" offset="10645375">It was repeated again in the 1910 Act admitting Arizona and New Mexico, and on six or seven other occasions, as recently as 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.176" offset="10692187">The position of the tribes is that these enabling Acts have not been changed or repealed, that they remain in effect, and that they absolutely bar state court jurisdiction over Indian rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.514" offset="10741611">Now, there is little doubt about what the McCarren... about what the disclaimers mean, excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.808" offset="10766793">They mean what they say.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.605" offset="10773898">They say that Indian lands, not forest lands, not public domain, not military reservations, only Indian lands shall remain under the absolute jurisdiction and control of the Congress of the United States until the disclaimers are revoked with the consent of both the United States and the respective state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.534" offset="10857699">At one point in this case there was a contention that the disclaimers were limited to proprietary matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.234" offset="10892494">As I understand the reply brief of the Arizona petitioners, that claim is no longer before the Court, and I won't any longer go into the meaning of the disclaimers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.449" offset="10937320">The critical questions relate to the relationship between the disclaimers and the McCarren Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.556" offset="10961771">McCarren, as I said, is simply a waiver of the government's immunity, no more, no less.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.706" offset="10994371">There is no indication anywhere on the face of the Act or in its history of any intent to repeal the disclaimers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.550" offset="11021748">There is no mention of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.813" offset="11026763">There is not even a hint of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.563" offset="11033764">And no one in this case has even argued that the disclaimers and McCarren are in irreconcilable conflict, the test for an implied repeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.654" offset="11078172">Effect, as I said, can be given to both McCarren and the disclaimers by holding that the McCarren Amendment's waiver of sovereign immunity applies to adjudication of Indian water rights in the federal courts of the disclaimer states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.864" offset="11135015">This result achieves the primary purpose of the McCarren Amendment, ensuring that all water rights on a stream, including the government's and the Indians', will be subject to adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.047" offset="11179736">There is no basis anywhere in the McCarren Amendment or in the governing rules for construing two statutes that bear on a common subject but totally subordinating and ignoring the disclaimers in favor of the McCarren Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.134" offset="11240027">Both laws can and therefore should and must be given effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.381" offset="11265000">Now, the petitioners' primary argument, however, is that the disclaimers are nothing more than a reservation of federal authority over Indians and their lands, and that Congress exercised this authority when it enacted McCarren, but this is contrary to what the disclaimers say.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.612" offset="11337934">They do not say that Congress reserves authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.532" offset="11349637">They say that Indian lands shall remain subject to the absolute jurisdiction and control of the United States until they are revoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.932" offset="11391224">They are solemn compacts pledging that Indians and their lands would not involuntarily be made subject to coercive state jurisdiction unless Congress and the people of the states consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.489" offset="11449529">This is an exercise of authority, not a reservation, and the disclaimers have been so applied by this Court on numerous occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.329" offset="11484846">The state's argument also, I point out, flies in the face of Public Law 280, in which Congress partially repealed the disclaimers because they were viewed as legal impediments to the assumption of state court jurisdiction over Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.119" offset="11556004">Now, the federal government takes a somewhat different tack in arguing against the disclaimer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.226" offset="11588396">It objects to distinguishing between disclaimer and non-disclaimer states on policy grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.739" offset="11614518">Since Colorado River upheld non-disclaimer state court jurisdiction over Indian water rights, the United States argues that the same rule now should be applied to disclaimer states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.812" offset="11662793">In effect, the government reads the Colorado River decision as an implied sub silentio repeal of the disclaimers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.384" offset="11701036">The obvious response is that the disclaimers are duly enacted laws of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.135" offset="11728099">They must be given effect unless they are found to be unconstitutional or impliedly repealed, and the government does not even attempt to show that the standards for finding an implied repeal have been met.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.986" offset="11783478">Congress obviously was aware that states admitted after 1889 were made subject to different laws than previously admitted states, and Congress has frequently applied different rules to Indians in different states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.278" offset="11840634">There is neither a compelling need for uniformity nor consistent historical practice of--</text>

            <text syncTime="3031.947" offset="12307286">Now, if the government believes that disclaimer and non-disclaimer states should be treated exactly alike, it is addressing its argument to the wrong institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.318" offset="12360784">Congress created that distinction, and it is for Congress, not this Court, to do away with it, and indeed, only a year after McCarren was enacted, when the disclaimers were specifically brought to the attention of the Congress, Congress did exactly that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.593" offset="12429852">It repealed the disclaimers in Public Law 280 in order to permit disclaimer state courts to assume limited civil and criminal jurisdiction over Indian disputes but of course specifically excluded the adjudication of Indian water rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.491" offset="12493486">So, what both the petitioners and the government's position have in common that they are asking this Court to do what Congress has never done, repeal the disclaimers in order to permit state court adjudications of Indian water rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.204" offset="12552314">Since effect, though, can and therefore must be given to both statutes, we submit that the federal courts should retain jurisdiction to adjudicate Indian water rights.</text>

            <label>Mr. Simon K. Rifkind</label>
            <text syncTime="3530.865" offset="14302936">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, my argument will be addressed to the considerations which necessarily must underlie the argument of this case as I see it, and that is a discussion of the factors addressed to our attention in the Akin case, the case that we have all decided to call Akin, Colorado River against... but I should like to open with this one sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.120" offset="14428011">One of the problems of a consolidated proceeding of this kind is that it homogenizes 12 different district cases, and the facts do not always fit a single pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.957" offset="14479315">I should therefore like to deal in the course of my argument with the facts as they are set forth in the Navajo case, and only in the Navajo case, because I think that gives you a simple structure and a simple situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.715" offset="14538352">Now, if the Akin case leaves room for any Indian water claim, I say if, then this is the case, and that I shall try to demonstrate in the course of my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.679" offset="14614211">As I listened to the arguments of my distinguished friends from Arizona and Montana, I got the impression that they never will find a case under Akin which will enable an Indian claim to remain in the federal court, but if that is so, then the statements in Akin which proclaim again and again that it is the exception and not the rule that seems to be turned upside-down, then we have the rule of abstention set forth in Akin become the universal rule, and then there are no cases which are outside of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.816" offset="14786829">That I cannot accept.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.302" offset="14792680">Now, in considering Akin, I want to deal with the factors involved, and one of them is history, and therefore, to the extent that occasionally I overlap the argument made by my friend who just preceded me, it isn't because I want to assert the disclaimer argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3675.368" offset="14880974">I simply want to narrate that as part of the history of this controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3680.259" offset="14900513">The Navajo nation, whom I represent, and by reason of the consolidation to some extent I speak for the other Indian tribes, are united in their perception that the choice of forum, which is the problem before us, in these cases is critical to their prosperity in future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.485" offset="14993509">From the vigor of the opposition by Arizona and Montana, I infer that they regard the Indians' perception is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3712.449" offset="15029349">This common perception springs from a long history, and of course within the few minutes of my disposal I can only mention a few points, a few aspects of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3724.615" offset="15077937">After years of warfare, the United States from time to time entered into treaties with the Indian tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3733.612" offset="15113986">I can't quote them all, but I refer you to the Apache Treaty of July 1, 1852, the Navajo Treaty of 1849, and the source of my claim to water, the particular source to which I shall advert, the Navajo Treaty of 1868.</text>
            <text syncTime="3753.198" offset="15192353">And the common aspect of these treaties is that the Indians are promised by this great nation, and I quote the words, "federal jurisdiction and federal protection".</text>
            <text syncTime="3768.161" offset="15252122">One sentence out of the 1868 treaty uses that language a little bit more quaintly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3777.392" offset="15289111">It says,</text>
            <text syncTime="3778.452" offset="15293291">"if bad men among the whites shall commit any wrong upon the person or property of the Indians, the United States will proceed at once to cause the offender to be arrested and punished according to the laws of the United States. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3795.789" offset="15362672">Out of these treaties and others of similar import, there has been distilled historically a national policy, first enunciated in these words in Rice against Olson back in 1945, and more recently in the McClannahan case in 1973, in these words:</text>
            <text syncTime="3820.637" offset="15462042">"The policy of leaving Indians free from state jurisdiction and control is deeply rooted in the nation's history. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3830.198" offset="15500285">And I say that that is a factor that should be taken into consideration in engaging in the weighing process that Akin instructs us to undertake.</text>
            <text syncTime="3839.694" offset="15538319">The Navajos, for whom I speak, never agreed to subject themselves or their property to the jurisdiction or laws of any state, and so the United States understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="3852.609" offset="15589937">They understood that that was their treaty arrangements with the Navajos, and in order to keep its promise to the Indians, and to put the matter beyond dispute, the United States Congress in 1910, before admitting the State of Arizona to the Union, exacted a promise from the people of that state that they would forever disclaim, and so forth, as you have heard from my friend, Mr. Pelcyger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3877.039" offset="15687635">The most recent step taken by the Congress consistent with this United States promise to the Indians, was the enactment in 1966 of Section 1362 of Article 28 to the Code conferring direct access upon the Indian tribes to the federal forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3897.434" offset="15769242">In the light of this history, it was perfectly natural that the Navajos turned to the federal court when they filed their complaint for a declaration of their federal rights only to the waters of the Little Colorado and for a quantification of those rights under the doctrines of the Winters case and the more recent case of California against Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="3927.550" offset="15889718">Now, the Navajos filed this complaint in the District Court of Airzona on the 17th of April, 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="3936.184" offset="15924304">At that time, there was no statute for stream adjudication in the state of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="3943.761" offset="15954606">That was enacted a little later, April 24th, 1979, but I lay no stress upon that time factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3952.132" offset="15988043">I regard it as without significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3955.848" offset="16002881">But I do stress that the Navajos' complaint is very narrowly focused.</text>
            <text syncTime="3962.158" offset="16028167">I quite agree with the gentleman from Montana.</text>
            <text syncTime="3964.986" offset="16039452">It is very narrowly focused.</text>
            <text syncTime="3966.767" offset="16046557">It asks for a declaration of the rights to the waters of the Little Colorado as determined by its treaty with the United States and as interpreted in Winters and Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="3979.605" offset="16097966">Such a declaration is sought against everyone, but it asks no determination of the rights of all the users of the Colorado River inter sese.</text>
            <text syncTime="3992.866" offset="16150943">Once its rights have been determined and declared, then there is a provision in the Arizona water statute which says that you can take this decree and enfold it into the Arizona decree in its proper hierarchy of rights of all the other users.</text>
            <text syncTime="4010.890" offset="16223041">So that as a practical matter... as my time is running out very fast... it is... avoids any possibility of competition between the two proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="4024.336" offset="16276853">There is no duplication, and even if the matter were all in the state courts, you would find that the Indian water rights, since it is derived from an entirely different set of principles, utterly unrelated to appropriation, utterly unrelated to beneficial use, utterly unrelated to any of those factors which determine rights in Arizona for private users--</text>

            <text syncTime="4754.668" offset="19198179">The reasons why it is appropriate for the federal court to adjudicate the federal Indian rights which are for federal water determined in accordance with federal law principles are too obvious to need elaboration if the McCarren Amendment did not make that solution impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="4783.934" offset="19315207">The Akin decision was at pains to point out that federal jurisdiction over water claims was not in any way diminished by the passage of that legislation, and accordingly, as my brother, Judge Rifkind, pointed out, if the reservation of that federal jurisdiction was to be meaningful, it must apply in at least some cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4817.516" offset="19449581">If these cases, particularly the Montana cases, in which the claims were filed in federal court almost five years before the state in its leisurely way prepared itself to begin an adjudication, and the federal court effectively sat on those complaints for that length of time, do not satisfy the Akin factors, it is hard to imagine one that does.</text>
            <text syncTime="4845.254" offset="19560549">Now, we have urged the Court to draw a clearer line only because the jurisdictional skirmishing that has ensued from the decision seems to us extremely wasteful and acrimonious.</text>
            <text syncTime="4861.233" offset="19624497">There is an ingredient in this case that was not present in Akin, and it is one of some importance, it seems to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="4869.949" offset="19659292">It is the Congressionally granted prerogative to Indian tribes to invoke the federal forum and very pointedly the federal forum under Section 1362 of the judicial code, and to do so in their own name.</text>
            <text syncTime="4888.316" offset="19732749">Regardless of any conflict of interest, it is desirable to attempt to accommodate that Congressional directive, the availability of a federal court to the Indian claims, with the policy of the McCarren Amendment, if that can be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="4912.306" offset="19828775">It seems to us that it can indeed be done, and at least when the tribes invoke that jurisdictional base as they have in all of the Arizona cases, and as they have in most of the Montana cases, by intervening, that choice should be respected, and it is a choice which respects the Congressional judgment that Indian claims are more appropriately adjudicated in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4947.261" offset="19968582">And that can live together with the concerns of the McCarren Amendment, which are to avoid a situation in which a tribe or the United States stands aloof, refusing to participate in the adjudication of its water rights in any forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="4967.394" offset="20049144">But we say that so long as by a joint effort of state and federal courts all of the rights in the stream can be adjudicated contemporaneously--</text>

            <text syncTime="5184.148" offset="20916095">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, yes, I do have some remarks.</text>
            <text syncTime="5195.344" offset="20960922">The tribes and the government speak of history and policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5199.298" offset="20976700">We believe that the history is the McCarren Amendment, that Congress's legislative intent was clear, and that that is where policy issues should be resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5209.276" offset="21016615">This Court interpreted the McCarren Amendment in its Colorado River decision, and I suggest that most of the suggestions of the tribes and the government are indeed to revisit that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5220.975" offset="21063426">For example, the suggestion that the McCarren Amendment did not waive Indian tribal sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="5225.678" offset="21082234">Indian tribal sovereignty is deemed waived because the assertion of the claims is by the United States, and the United States's tribal... sovereign immunity is waived under the McCarren Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5236.531" offset="21125597">The reading of the Congressional intent with respect to Section 1362 that Mr. Claiborne just offered to you would suggest to you that the Indian tribes have a greater right to access to the federal courts under Section 1362, which only eliminated the $10,000 jurisdictional barrier, than the United States has under Section 1345, which this Court was dealing with in Colorado River, a truly anomalous result.</text>
            <text syncTime="5268.939" offset="21255269">That is not what either Congress has intended or what this Court would intend in the Colorado River decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="5276.048" offset="21283691">Mr. Pelcyger suggests that the McCarren Amendment... excuse me, that the disclaimer really suggests that there is an absolute bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="5288.214" offset="21332383">The disclaimer is not an absolute bar, as this Court has suggested in its prior decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5294.773" offset="21358610">For example, in the Mescalero Apache tribe case, this Court specifically said that even on reservations state laws may be applied to Indians unless such application would interfere with reservation self-government or impair a right granted or reserved by federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5313.140" offset="21432066">That was a New Mexico case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5315.734" offset="21442411">Similar language is found in Arizona cases, in Montana cases, in Washington cases, in many of the disclaimer states.</text>
            <text syncTime="5323.232" offset="21472399">This Court has said on many prior occasions that the absolute jurisdiction of the federal government does not oust the state of all jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="5335.289" offset="21520673">Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I am not aware of what a disclaimer statute would be.</text>

            <text syncTime="5341.583" offset="21545855">No, with a disclaimer... I mean, say the Washington cases, the New Mexico cases, Mescalero, that you are referring to.</text>
            <text syncTime="5347.019" offset="21567589">Was that statement by the Court that you quote made in the context of the disclaimer provision in the state's constitution being argued?</text>

            <text syncTime="5356.062" offset="21603743">Mr. Justice Rehnquist, no, the disclaimers are occasionally mentioned in these cases, but they have never been seen as a bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="5363.151" offset="21632164">With respect to the theory of the government, I want to allude particularly to the Navajo tribe, because Justice O'Connor was making a point that has a great deal of validity in these semi-arid states.</text>
            <text syncTime="5375.052" offset="21679707">Both in terms of identifying legally what water has been appropriated, which is done in the state court proceedings, and identifying physically how much water is available, it is very important to be able to integrate everything.</text>
            <text syncTime="5387.515" offset="21729549">The Navajo tribe was put together in 17 different sections at 17 different times.</text>
            <text syncTime="5394.780" offset="21758597">There are claims of non-Indians interspersed among those various parts of the Navajo Indian reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5401.059" offset="21783779">That same situation exists with respect to other reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5405.009" offset="21799557">Whatever court is going to determine all of these rights is going to have to have all of the parties before it to hear all of the claims at the same time, identify the various dates and the priorities, how much water is physically available, what prior rights were established, and then put it all together.</text>
            <text syncTime="5420.942" offset="21863295">This is what Congress had in mind when it adopted the McCarren Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5424.627" offset="21878029">The legislative history is clear that it was pointing to many of the various state statutes that permitted precisely that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5430.967" offset="21903420">This Court in Footnote 2 of the Colorado decision referred to the Arizona statutes as among those statutes that could determine all of these rights, and the Court has declared on several prior occasions that the adjudication of water rights are a unique kind of litigation that require the... all of the parties before the Court in a unitary proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="5452.535" offset="21989624">Unless that is true, you have intolerable conflicts between courts, for example, the administration of the same water by a federal court on the one hand and a state court on the other hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="5464.659" offset="22038107">To which court do the parties go if a conflict develops with respect to the administration of the decree at a later date?</text>
            <text syncTime="5470.626" offset="22062035">The conflicts are intolerable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5472.591" offset="22069872">And if that kind of a proposal is necessary to satisfy the government's concern, it can easily be addressed to Congress, which could then change the law to try to address some of these policy considerations, but it has not done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="5487.148" offset="22128073">We submit, if it please the Court, that the only way that the state of Arizona and the other arid and semi-arid states of the west are going to finally get a complete and binding determination of water rights so that everyone, Indians and non-Indians alike, can move forward, can develop their economies, is if all of the parties are before the same court at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5511.699" offset="22226293">This Court in Colorado River said that the rights of the Indians would not be imperiled by sending them to state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5517.747" offset="22250535">There has been no suggestion by any of the Indian tribes in the cases before you now that the state courts of Arizona or Montana are hostile to the Indian tribes, and in Colorado River you specifically rejected the argument of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5534.628" offset="22318035">You said that is an erroneous assumption, to assume that if the Indian tribes have to go to state court, that somehow state court judges are going to deprive them of their rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5545.141" offset="22360040">In any event, this Court sits in final review of any question which has been preserved that comes from a state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5551.934" offset="22387207">We submit that these cases should be returned to the district court, and that the state court adjudications should be allowed to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5559.617" offset="22418032">Thank you.</text>
