            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="141554">We will hear arguments first this morning in United States Postal Service against Aikens.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.544" offset="175722">Mr. Wallace, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="11.059" offset="185753">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this employment discrimination case involves a claim of disparate treatment which is under this Court's decisions of claim of intentional racial discrimination, under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.049" offset="277704">The case is before the Court for a second time.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.954" offset="293273">In June, 1981, on a petition for certiorari filed by Solicitor General McCree, the Court with two Justices dissenting vacated and remanded the case for further consideration in light of Texas Department of Community Affairs against Burdine, and the case is now here on certiorari from the court of appeals decision on that remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.834" offset="400793">Our concern, and the question presented in both of the petitions, focuses exclusively on the legal standard adopted by the court of appeals for establishing a prima facie case of employment discrimination in situations where the employer is selecting an individual from a group of qualified individuals which is racially or sexually or heterogeneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.645" offset="564111">The particular case arises in the context of promotions.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.409" offset="587098">For present purposes, the facts may be simply stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.156" offset="610086">With respect to the promotions and details at issue, after an administrative investigation and hearing and appeal from that hearing were all resolved against him, the Respondent filed suit under Title VII in the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.977" offset="689394">The Postal Service did not deny that the Respondent, along with other individuals under consideration, had the qualifications necessary to be eligible for the promotions and details, and there was no dispute that Respondent is a black person, and that the Postal Service selected white employees for the particular promotions and details at issue instead of Respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.182" offset="818230">The district court found that from 1952 to 1966, Respondent had advanced steadily through a succession of supervisory positions in the D.C. Post Office, and by March of 1973, he was the fifth highest ranking official in that Post Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.796" offset="924705">It also found no evidence of specific acts of discrimination against him, and no other direct evidence that he was treated any differently because of his race from the way other employees were treated.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.197" offset="982279">And the district court found no credible evidence that he was as qualified or more qualified than other individuals who were detailed or promoted during the period in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.315" offset="1042778">It also found that there had been a considerable increase in the number of black employees occupying high level positions in the District of Columbia Post Office during the pertinent period, and that during that period, other blacks as well as whites were promoted or detailed to positions above the Respondent's position, and that by the time of the district court's opinion, almost all the high level positions in that post office were held by blacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.959" offset="1169316">Now, none of these findings was held to be clearly erroneous, and for present purposes, even though it's possible that other inferences could have been drawn from the underlying facts, which are rehearsed at some length in Respondent's brief, the underlying evidence, for present purposes, those findings are the premise of the case, because they are the premise on which the court of appeals rendered its decision, and those facts found by the district court do not in our view add up to a prima facie case of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.443" offset="1335245">The reason for this can be simply stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.503" offset="1363562">If unexplained, those findings do not show that it is more likely than not that the employer's selection was based on an impermissible consideration, such as race, to paraphrase this Court's opinion in the Fernco case, or if unexplained, these facts do not show circumstances giving rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination, to paraphrase what this Court said in the Burdine case.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.239" offset="1494488">In other words, when this Court had spoken generically about what constitutes a prima facie case of discrimination under Title VII, the standard is really no different from what it is in establishing any other prima facie case, a showing that if the showing is unrefuted in any way, that it is more likely than not that the case has been proven.</text>

            <text syncTime="436.965" offset="1889355">Title VII cases are tried to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.182" offset="1902207">It is a Rule 41(b) motion, and since the standard of proof is the preponderance of the evidence, if the district court at the conclusion of the plaintiff's evidence concludes that that evidence shows that it is more likely than not that discrimination was a factor and the... and therefore denies the 41(b) motion, and the defendant rests, that's the same thing as saying that he has met his burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="469.592" offset="2019863">The district court can also rule on a 41(b) motion at the end of the plaintiff's case that assuming that I were to believe the plaintiff's witnesses, there is enough to get by a motion... there is enough to enter judgment for the plaintiff if the defendant puts on no case, but he might nonetheless, if the defendant chose to put on no case, after having denied a motion at the close of the plaintiff's case, I should think still enter a judgment for the defendant when it came to his duty to weigh the credibility of the witnesses.</text>

            <text syncTime="501.424" offset="2147236">Well, it's conceivable, Mr. Justice, although he would be more likely to be reserving judgment on whether the plaintiff has made out a sufficient case to withstand the Rule 41(b) motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.728" offset="2220378">He can't really be depending on the defendant's evidence to complete the plaintiff's showing.</text>

            <text syncTime="593.011" offset="2513577">We filed a petition for rehearing the first time the case was in the court of appeals, making that point, and that petition for rehearing was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.992" offset="2549521">We have not contested that issue further before this Court, either on the first petition or on the second petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.627" offset="2587974">We have accepted the court of appeals' ruling that in effect the district court granted the Rule 41(b) motion after hearing all of the evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="623.530" offset="2635621">But in no other branch of the law where there's been a trial, where the plaintiff puts on evidence, the defendant puts on evidence, the judge enters findings of fact and conclusions of law, would something on appeal be talked about as failure to make out a prima facie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.836" offset="2696852">Do you think our decisions make the Title VII litigation unique for some reason?</text>

            <text syncTime="643.990" offset="2717436">I do not, Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.178" offset="2726214">As I said, we thought initially that the court of appeals was in error in the way it read the district court's judgment in the case, but the district court's conclusions were not a model of clarity.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.453" offset="2787340">In one conclusion, the district court did say that the plaintiff had failed to make a prima facie case, although the district court had earlier denied the 41(b) motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.837" offset="2836868">As we read what happened, the court of appeals in effect said that the district court belatedly granted the Rule 41(b) motion in this case, and treated the case as if the district court had not made findings about whether the prima facie case had been rebutted by the defendant, even though the evidence may well have been heard here in its entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.748" offset="2940522">We don't really regard the procedural rules for Title VII cases as different from those in any other field of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.494" offset="2999454">The confusion has stemmed, we think, from a misuse by the court of appeals in this circuit and by some other lower courts of the more particularized analytical framework that this Court applied in the McDonnell Douglas against Green case, that fit the facts of that particular case in analyzing whether a prima facie case had been made out on the facts that were before the Court there.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.478" offset="3147412">We don't regard that framework as inconsistent with the later, more generic descriptions of what constitutes a prima facie case that I adverted to earlier in my argument, but rather as a useful analytical guide to the particular facts that were before the Court in McDonnell Douglas against Green, and that analysis is set forth on Page 6 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.169" offset="3262142">And it fit that case very well, because it showed not only that the plaintiff was a minority applicant who applied and was qualified for the job, and despite his qualifications was rejected, but importantly, there's a fourth element, that after his rejection, the employer, contrary to his apparent economic self-interest, continued to carry the vacancy that he was trying to fulfill and continued to look for applications from persons of the plaintiff's qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.761" offset="3432565">Now, what the court below has failed to recognize is that in a different factual circumstance where that fourth element is neutralized by the employer's mere selection of one qualified applicant over another, these four elements in themselves no longer add up to a prima facie case that makes it more--</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="845.721" offset="3524411">So you think in McDonnell if there had been two applicants, one black and one white, both qualified, that the... just because the white was chosen would not make out a prima facie case?</text>

            <text syncTime="858.013" offset="3573521">--That is exactly our point, Mr. Justice, that there has to be a showing of something more than these four elements if the fourth element is neutralized, because the fourth element was a necessary part of what added up to the prima facie case as those facts were analyzed, because it was an element of an employer acting contrary to his apparent economic self-interest, and therefore put a burden of production on him.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.077" offset="3701835">The burden of persuasion never shifts, but a burden of production on him to come forward or else judgment would be re-entered against him to explain why he acted contrary to his apparent economic self-interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="906.696" offset="3768290">Mr. Wallace, is it the government's position that the plaintiff in this case would have met the burden that you say he should have met had he established that he was as qualified or more qualified than the person selected?</text>

            <text syncTime="925.001" offset="3841538">Well, in order to come up with something comparable to the fourth element here, to show that the employer was acting contrary to his apparent economic self-interest, one would have to say that that would be shown by his selecting someone less qualified than the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.368" offset="3927010">If he is merely selecting someone equally qualified, the fourth element remains neutralized in our view.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.849" offset="3952924">This Court said in Burdine that so long as impermissible considerations are not the governing factor, an employer has discretion to choose among equally qualified persons.</text>

            <text syncTime="1038.565" offset="4295755">If you think of the ordinary McDonnell Douglas type hiring, you have presumably an indeterminate number of vacancies and minimum qualifications, and the inference is from business practice that the first people who come along and meet those minimum qualifications are going to be hired, but with a promotional decision, you frequently have only one vacancy, and a finite number of applicants within the organization.</text>

            <text syncTime="1177.258" offset="4850491">There had been some dispute about that during the trial, because he had refused to accept assignments to certain positions that were said to have been positions that would have made him better qualified to be considered for the promotions that he was interested in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.968" offset="4937322">And ultimately, the court of appeals focused on whether the employer had adequately specified that that kind of experience was a desirable qualification, even though not necessarily an indispensable qualification for the position at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.396" offset="5023108">But no one on the court of appeals recognized that the real shortcoming was not that he wasn't qualified, at least minimally, for consideration for these jobs, but that he didn't show it added up to a showing that it was more likely than not that the selection resulted from discrimination because the fourth element had been neutralized in the McDonnell Douglas analysis.</text>

            <text syncTime="1849.643" offset="7540058">The second way in which a prima facie case was made was that there was an immense statistical disparity between the representation of blacks in the work force and whites in the work force and blacks and whites in supervisory positions.</text>
