            <label>Mr. Robert F. Gore</label>
            <text syncTime="42.061" offset="312119">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the basic dispute in this case has been going on for 12 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.101" offset="344197">I will not review the 12 years of litigation history.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.227" offset="360706">It is adequately covered in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.099" offset="368230">I would, however, like to highlight some key facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.145" offset="380455">The original dispute involves the employment status of owner-operators of dump trucks who haul materials to and from construction sites.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.611" offset="418280">The question is whether they are independent contractors or employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.326" offset="437193">This employment status determines many things, including whether these owner-operators could be required to join or support the Teamsters Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.465" offset="469689">In 1977, while the employment status was still being litigated, the Teamsters Union and various contractors' associations in San Diego county voluntarily entered into new master labor agreements requiring that the contractors treat these owner-operators as employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.646" offset="546385">The Teamsters Union, through contractors, then enforced the master labor agreements, requiring that the non-union owner-operators join the Teamsters Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.278" offset="592987">In order to stay in business, the Petitioner and other owner-operators joined the union under protest.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.528" offset="621931">They paid their initiation fees, monthly dues, and fringe benefit contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.964" offset="643665">They then filed unfair labor practice charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.040" offset="655994">The original unfair labor practice charge alleged a violation of the secondary boycott prohibitions of the Act, Section 8(b)(4).</text>
            <text syncTime="136.023" offset="687968">At the request of the National Labor Relations Board, these charges were withdrawn, and a hot cargo violation was then alleged, a violation of Section 8(e).</text>
            <text syncTime="145.408" offset="725480">Petitioner's unfair labor practice charges were consolidated with similar charges by the California Dump Truck Owners Association, and the Board issued a complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.811" offset="771038">Almost eight months after being required to join the union, a federal court enjoined further enforcement of the hot cargo provisions, pending a determination by the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.773" offset="814923">After a hearing, the Administrative Law Judge found that the owner-operators were in fact independent contractors, and that the challenged provisions of the master labor agreement were a violation of Section 8(e).</text>
            <text syncTime="183.081" offset="876154">He issued a narrow cease and desist order, and ordered the employer associations and the union to make the owner-operators whole.</text>

            <text syncTime="209.587" offset="982212">Now, the Board affirmed the ALJ's findings of facts, but refused to grant the make whole remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.647" offset="1006453">The Board gave three reasons for denying the make whole remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="228.670" offset="1058489">All the parties petitioned for review in various courts of appeals, and we had a race to the courthouse--</text>

            <text syncTime="236.778" offset="1090986">--It is Footnote 2, Mr. Chief Justice, and it would be in the petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.493" offset="1125781">It should be on Page 17a of the petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.256" offset="1160889">The District of Columbia Circuit enforced the Board's order in all respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.500" offset="1193803">In a similar case involving almost identical language in the Southern California master labor agreement, the Board issued a similar order.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.183" offset="1228599">The Ninth Circuit rejected the Board's rationale for denying a make whole remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.433" offset="1249601">The issue here is not... The Petitioner agrees, first of all, with the National Labor Relations Board that the issue is not whether the Board has the power to grant a make whole remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.005" offset="1299861">Rather, the issue is whether the Board improperly refused to grant a make whole remedy to the victims of an illegal hot cargo agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.268" offset="1332879">The Board's three reasons for not granting this remedy were: one, insufficient evidence in the record with respect to alleged losses directly attributable to actual coercion by the Respondentse two, a reimbursement order typically used to make whole employees to be generally overbroad and inappropriate in the context of an 8(e) violation; and finally, the Board noted that the aggrieved owner-operators, because they were engaged in business as independent contractors, could pursue a damage claim under Section 303.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert F. Gore</label>
            <text syncTime="335.300" offset="1485017">It is our position, Justice Brennan, that they could not pursue a 303 action unless there had been also a violation of 8(b)(4), and I think we quoted in our brief here a concurring with Justice Stewart in the Connell dissent.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert F. Gore</label>
            <text syncTime="353.401" offset="1557428">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.964" offset="1563697">It is our petition... or it is our position that the Board misconstrued the statute and abused its discretion because each of these three reasons that it stated is flawed.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.287" offset="1613017">Because of time constraints, I will only highlight the flaws in two of the reasons, and then I would like to discuss the third reason in some detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.485" offset="1641751">The first reason, the availability of a 303 suit, our position is adequately stated, I believe, in Pages 28 to 39 of our brief, and also in Pages 59 to 62 of the California Dump Truck brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.856" offset="1695250">In a nutshell, we believe that neither the statutory language nor the legislative history support the Board's assumption that a 303 action is available for a voluntary hot cargo agreement, and secondly, the Board could not avoid its statutory responsibility because of a possible alternate forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.112" offset="1772259">At Pages 40 and 41 of the Solicitor General's brief, apparently they now concede that the Board's reliance on 303 was misplaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.843" offset="1807159">The second reason given by the Board is insufficient evidence of losses directly attributable to actual coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.434" offset="1841536">As to the non-union owner-operators, using Terra Trucking as a broker, the Board's reason is incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.538" offset="1869957">The Board affirmed the ALJ's findings of fact, and he had found in the record that the union sent a letter demanding that the broker not employ the non-union owner-operators until the union cleared them.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.659" offset="1926486">He also held that Terra Trucking told these non-union owner-operators to either join the union or he would cease using their services.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.280" offset="1968909">He gave them five days in which to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.904" offset="1979462">The ALJ also found that Shepard and others joined as a result of the union letter, and that Shepard joined the union under protest.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.994" offset="2019795">The ALJ pointed out that the owner-operators had two choices, become an employee, and therefore a union member, against their will, or go out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.990" offset="2063786">And the ALJ also found that union membership resulted from the hot cargo provisions that had been enforced by both the employers and the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.138" offset="2116344">Given these undisputed findings of fact, the Board's stated reason is incorrect, and I believe an additional reason here is the Ninth Circuit in a similar case.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.292" offset="2160961">It held that when an unlawful collective bargaining agreement is itself coercive, there is no logical reason for denying a reimbursement order because there is no technical violation of 8(b)(4).</text>
            <text syncTime="519.036" offset="2219998">In both instances, if you focus on the victim, he has lost the same thing, and been compelled to do the same thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="554.693" offset="2362626">And was there any evidence in the record that the operators contributed to the benefit funds as a result of the illegal provision in the master labor agreement?</text>

            <text syncTime="566.282" offset="2408915">However, I believe, on Page 43 of the ALJ's decision, he specifically finds the contractor associations, and their findings of... they alleged it as a defense, and the ALJ found that it was not a defense, the fact that previously he had signed a short... a leasing agreement that authorized the broker to deduct these.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.929" offset="2511524">So the ALJ specifically found that it was because of the master labor agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1394.803" offset="5723018">The question before the Court in this case is not whether the remedy selected by the Board from the range of remedies available to it was in a court's view the proper remedy to select, but rather, whether the remedy chosen by the Board was within the range of remedies available to it, or, put another way, whether it abused its discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.951" offset="5807655">We agree with the Petitioner in this case that Section 303 of the Labor Management Relations Act does not afford a remedy to someone who is injured by a bare 8(e) violation, that is, by the existence and implementation of an agreement that was entered into in violation of Section 8(e).</text>

            <text syncTime="1538.880" offset="6299384">Coercion perhaps in some other sense, but the type of coercion to which Section 8(b)(4) speaks, it would not, and in fact this Court's decisions in Servett and Teamsters versus Morton make that unmistakably clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.769" offset="6350897">There, the Court said that the mere request by a union to an employer to cease doing business with another person does not violate Section 8(b)(4), and in this instance, when the union sent a letter to the employer, what happened is, the union called the employer's attention to the fact that there were several independent contractors who were not union members, and requested that the broker, Terra Trucking Company, cease using the services of those owner-operators, but that is precisely the sort of request that this Court said in Servett and Teamsters versus Morton is not coercive for purposes of Section 8(b)(4).</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.998" offset="6515782">But quite aside from that, if Petitioner disagreed with that proposition in that there was in fact 8(b)(4) coercion in this case, he was, of course, free to file the remedy that Congress contemplated in those circumstances, a suit under Section 303 of the Act to recover damages for injuries sustained as a result of a Section 8(b)(4) violation, and the fact that the Board did not in this case find a Setion 8(b)(4) violation would not preclude Mr. Shepard or any other owner-operator from establishing such a violation in a separate Section 303 proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.095" offset="6660187">And indeed, we think that although we agree with Petitioner that there is not a damage remedy available under Section 303 for a bare 8(e) violation, which is all the Board found here, Petitioner draws precisely the wrong conclusion from that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.694" offset="6738659">When Congress amended the Act in 1959 to outlaw hot cargo agreements for the first time, it also amended Section 8(b)(4) to bar union coercion to force the employer to enter into such an agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.690" offset="6794561">It amended Section 10(l), which provides mandatory preliminary injunctive relief in the case of secondary activity, and provided that the general counsel must seek an injunction where there is cause to believe that there is secondary activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.044" offset="6859972">Congress amended Section 10(l) to require the general counsel to seek such an injunction in cases involving Section 8(e) violations, but significantly, Congress did not amend Section 303, the damage provision of the statute, to provide a cause of action for damages or monetary relief for a bare Section 8(e) violation.</text>

I can't speak for what the Board would do in any particular case, but looking at the facts of this case, an 8(e) violation without some additional aggravating circumstance, at least, would not, at least in this case, did not cause the Board to issue or order additional relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.783" offset="7266959">But that doesn't mean that, for instance, if there was additional action on behalf of the employer and union in another case, that the Board may not consider whether it would be appropriate to order reimbursement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.043" offset="7315965">For example, if, notwithstanding a Board cease and desist order, the union and employer go back and once again enter into precisely or virtually identical 8(e) violation, then there would be time enough for the Board to consider whether some additional reimbursement remedy would be appropriate, since the union and employer would have by that point revealed that they were not going to abide by the Board's cease and desist order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.938" offset="7423590">But in this case, there was no reason... no aggravating circumstances for the Board... to give the Board reason to believe that a reimbursement order was necessary to create that sort of disincentive, and in fact one of the chief reasons for this is that there was the ongoing litigation over the question, as counsel for Petitioner has pointed out, over the question of whether these owner-operators were even independent contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.460" offset="7525676">If they were employees, then the application of the master labor agreement to them and the... including the union security provisions to them would have been lawful, and the union's efforts to enforce that requirement in the master labor agreement would have been lawful.</text>

            <text syncTime="1876.761" offset="7650855">Well, the original charge filed by Mr. Shepard was based on or alleged what amounted to an 8(b)(4) violation, alleging, incidentally, not that the union was coercing Mr. Shepard, but consistent with the secondary aspect of Section 8(b)(4), alleged that the union was coercing Terra, the broker, by virtue of the existence of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.651" offset="7778437">But as I understand the Board's practice or the general counsel's practice, if he chooses not to file a complaint based on a charge that is filed with him because he believes, for example, that the evidence would not support the charge of an unfair labor practice, in this case a charge of an 8(b)(4) violation, he will give the charging party an opportunity to withdraw the charge, and file a complaint based on those violations that the general counsel does believe are present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.482" offset="7897764">So, my understanding of what happened in this case is that the general counsel gave Petitioner an opportunity to withdraw his charge, and refile alleging a violation of Section 8(e).</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.368" offset="7945307">If the charging party doesn't withdraw his charge in that fashion, he has a right of appeal to the general counsel's office here in Washington to seek to have the general counsel file a complaint, but in this case, in lieu of doing that, as I understand what happened, Mr. Shepard withdrew the charge--</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.936" offset="8031616">But apparently it was the general counsel's view that this case only warranted going forward on the basis of the evidence presented under Section 8(e).</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.727" offset="8090757">As I mentioned, the special statutory scheme that Congress fashioned in the area of secondary activity and its meticulous attention to those circumstances in which it would afford various remedies we think establishes that Congress's withholding of a damage remedy for a bare 8(b) violation was deliberate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.026" offset="8211965">Just to reiterate for a moment, Congress added Section 8(e) in the Act in '59, provided the mandatory preliminary injunctive remedy in 1959, but did not amend Section 303 to provide an automatic damage remedy for the individual, and we think that Congress evidently concluded that an 8(b)(4) violation involving coercion was an unfair labor practice of a different order in Section 8(e), and that it was not necessary in order to effectuate the policies of the Act to provide a damage remedy on the basis of a bare 8(e) violation, and we think that--</text>

            <text syncTime="2201.563" offset="8950081">If Congress determined that a Section 8(e) violation was a violation of a different order, then the Board, looking to the absence of the 8(b) coercion, could draw the same conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.540" offset="9005983">This Court said in Gissel Packing Company that one of the purposes of giving the Board discretion to fashion the appropriate remedy was to permit it to tailor its remedy to unfair labor practices of varying intensity, as the Court put it, and I think that in determining the intensity of an unfair labor practice, it is not necessary for the Board to look only to the resulting impact on the owner-operators in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2414.594" offset="9802195">And the reason why I think that is especially important is that the... in some... the purpose of the Board's remedial scheme is to eliminate obstacles to the restoring of industrial peace and to stop and prevent unfair labor practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.335" offset="9893206">In some situations, again, as the Court noted in Gissel, it may be appropriate just to issue a cease and desist order, if the Board is satisfied that that would be sufficient to effectuate the policies of the Act, because, for example, there may be no reason to believe that the violation will recur.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.376" offset="9953392">In other circumstances, though, the Board may believe that some further measures may be necessary, perhaps because of... in situations involving unfair labor practice affecting employees, that the... that there may be certain lingering consequences of an unfair labor practice, that it is not enough to simply issue a cease and desist order, that the Board may have to go further.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.007" offset="10055897">And this is the point that the Court made in the Carpenters Local 60 case that counsel for Petitioner cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.534" offset="10085990">In Carpenters Local 60, it is true that the Court reversed the reimbursement remedy there because it found that there was not even a consequence of a violation, that none of the union... none of the employees involved there had joined the union because of the closed shop arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.494" offset="10185777">But the Court didn't stop there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.257" offset="10192883">It pointed out, quoting the earlier decision in Consolidated Edison, that the power of the Board to award affirmative relief is the power to eliminate consequences of violation where those consequences would thwart the accomplishment of the Act's purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.783" offset="10258920">So, just because there may be a consequence of the violation that may remain, it does not mean that that consequence will thwart the policies of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.794" offset="10299044">And the Board can conclude that it is not necessary for that reason to go ahead and order affirmative relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.336" offset="10333212">This Court said in Auto Workers versus Russell that the power to award reimbursement, even the affirmative action that is expressly mentioned in the Act, back pay, doesn't flow automatically from the finding of a violation and injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.876" offset="10403325">The Board must first be convinced that the awarding of the affirmative action, in that case back pay, would effectuate the policies of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.279" offset="10440941">And we submit that where the Board is not convinced that going further than the cease and desist order, going beyond the cease and desist order to restrain future violations, where the Board is convinced that nothing more is necessary or appropriate, that that is precisely the sort of discretionary decision that was submitted, that the Congress conferred on the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.661" offset="10530489">And this Court has repeatedly said that the Board's exercise of its discretion under Section 10(c) to fashion an appropriate remedy is subject to very narrow judicial review, and in fact in Virginia Electric Power Company, one of the earlier cases decided under the Act, the Court phrased the test in terms of... by stating, the Board's order should stand</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.652" offset="10626411">"unless it can be shown that the order is a patent attempt to achieve ends other than those which can fairly be said to effectuate the policies of the Act. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.131" offset="10656399">Now, that language, we submit, reflects a broad deference on the part of the Court to the decisions by the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.580" offset="10694120">In this case, there is an additional factor that is present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.518" offset="10709898">This isn't a case like VEPCO, or the typical case that has come to this Court, or even the courts of appeals, regarding the Board's remedial powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.122" offset="10748350">This is not a case in which it is asserted that the Board has gone too far, and this Court has had occasion to consider what the power of the Board is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.260" offset="10780847">Here, the allegation is, or the assertion is that the Board's order did not go far enough in the submission of Petitioner, and in those sort of circumstances where the assertion is that the Board has not gone far enough, we submit that the party challenging the Board's order should be required to show, as the D.C. circuit has said in several of their decisions, that the remedy the Board did order will be so ineffective to enforce the policies of the Act as to be insufficient as a matter of law, or that, in other words, the Board has abandoned any exercise of its discretion, and it has in fact done nothing to effectuate the policies of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.275" offset="10956912">Well, in this case, it cannot be said that the cease and desist order will be so ineffective to accomplish the Act's purposes as to be insufficient as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.596" offset="10998186">We think that is plainly not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.191" offset="11004559">First of all, we think, as I explained before, that the Board's decision draws powerful support from the judgment Congress itself made, that monetary relief does not have to follow, and secondly, that by enacting Section 303, Congress made a judgment that third parties who in effect stand outside the triangle of the usual employer-employee-union relationship, that their remedies generally should be in a Section 303 action in federal district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.348" offset="11129216">They shouldn't... The Board was thought to be an inappropriate forum ordinarily for adjudicating the consequences of parties' unfair labor practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.457" offset="11165683">The Board called attention to the existence of the Section 303 remedy in this case, and we think that, too, supports the Board's decision not to go further here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2797.642" offset="11334434">--That is monetary relief, but it also contains the element of coercion in the 8(b)(4) violation, which is consistent with Congress's judgment in 303.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.498" offset="11369856">Again, the parallel is complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.513" offset="11381872">Where there is the 8(b)(4) violation that would give rise to a damage remedy in court, the Board under Santini Brothers has gone ahead and ordered the reimbursement remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.490" offset="11425758">That is not to say that the Board would find it appropriate to enter into a full compensatory scheme under Section 10(c), because as we explain in our brief, the legislative history of Section 303 makes it clear that Congress did not believe in general that the Board was the appropriate forum for third parties to litigate the damages that they have suffered as a result of the union's activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.217" offset="11512693">And so, for instance, in this case, if an owner-operator, instead of joining the union, decided... resisted and lost work as a result, that is precisely the sort of consequential damages, lost profits and what not, that Congress assigned to the courts, not to the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.319" offset="11593150">And so it is clear that it would be inappropriate for the Board to depart on a broad scale to establish those sorts of remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.205" offset="11640693">But in the Santini Brothers case, the remedy was limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.781" offset="11662950">Even though this lost profits sort of relief was sought, the Board simply awarded a reimbursement remedy against the union, but the Board found 8(b)(4) violations in the facts of Santini Brothers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.711" offset="11718643">But there is no case where the Board has on the basis of a bare 8(e) violation awarded relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.708" offset="11742675">For the reasons that I have explained, then, we think that the statutory scheme does not contemplate that the Board must go ahead and award the reimbursement remedy that was requested in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.326" offset="11821147">In addition, the facts of this case do not suggest that the Board should depart from the practice suggested by Congress's enactment of Section 303.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.855" offset="11863257">There was no showing of extensive violations or injury as a result of the existence of the 8(e) violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.836" offset="11899201">We have evidence in the record only pertaining to two brokers, and the circumstances surrounding joining the union only as to Terra.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.987" offset="11931802">Petitioner himself signed a subhall agreement when he first came to work for... first went to work through his broker, in which he agreed to have union fringe benefits deducted from his checks, and there is no indication that he resisted that or protested that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.169" offset="12004527">It was only when he also had to pay the union dues and fees that he resisted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.038" offset="12028037">So, even though Mr. Shepard is not seeking a refund of fringe benefits to certain trust funds, as we are told now, he still benefitted during that period from having been working under a collective bargaining agreement secured by the union that in fact provided those fringe benefit plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.782" offset="12106927">Another factor present here is the one I have mentioned before, that there was ongoing litigation, and indeed the Board itself had held that these persons were not independent contractors, but were employees, and it was not until after this agreement was entered into that the Ninth Circuit changed its view on that subject, and even then the Board denies... It does not have to acquiesce in that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.147" offset="12200445">It was still... It was not until later that the Board changed its view and said that these were independent contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.721" offset="12226672">So, the Board could legitimately take into account that the fact that the status of the owner-operators was uncertain, and indeed there was case law supporting that they were employees, that it was not necessary to award a reimbursement remedy to deter future violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.169" offset="12300546">It could instead conclude that once this legal question was cleared up, that the union and the employer would abide by the result the Board reached and that the courts have reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.837" offset="12339208">And then, finally, with respect to the distinction between the award of reimbursement to an employee and the award of reimbursement to someone who stands outside the employment relationship, in this case, an independent contractor, we think there is a big difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.424" offset="12401483">Employees have Section 7 rights, the right to freedom of association or to refrain from that, to select a collective bargaining agent or not, and this Board... or this Court in Virginia Electric Power and subsequent cases has recognized that when the company or the union takes action that might impact upon the Section 7 rights, that it may be necessary to refund or reimburse the employees for their dues, so that the dues will not continue to maintain a company-dominated union or a closed shop in order to undo the consequences so the employees will feel free to engage in Section 7 activities in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.764" offset="12590923">That doesn't apply necessarily to independent contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.540" offset="12601999">They do not work in the close confines of an employee-employer relationship with the union being present.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.195" offset="12624569">They are independent businessmen, and in this case, in fact, the record shows that most of the independent contractors worked through a number of brokers, with a number of contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.238" offset="12668768">They go from day to day to different sites.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.191" offset="12676605">There is no reason to think that independent businessmen like that need the same sort of protection in the form of a reimbursement remedy as employees do with respect to Section 7 rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.982" offset="12727805">And we think that this in part explains the difference that Congress drew when it did not provide a damage remedy for bare 8(e) violations for third parties such as independent contractors or other employers with whom the primary... or with whom the employer might cease doing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.396" offset="12809412">Congress decided that reimbursement was appropriate only in the case of aggravated coercion by the union.</text>

            <text syncTime="3277.068" offset="13252135">There were... The distinction that was being made here that independent contractors shouldn't get a remedy, reimbursement orders have been given to employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.234" offset="13312739">Recently there is case law that the employer may have to make whole unions for excess... for expenses, for frivolous litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.758" offset="13354848">Employees have certainly gotten reimbursement orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.804" offset="13367074">Now all of a sudden the policy is that because you are an independent contractor, I would think that an independent contractor could also be an employer, but he can't get a reimbursement order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.677" offset="13406571">I don't think Congress intended that when they made Section 8(e) an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.815" offset="13431126">Also, there was a discussion that the independent contractor benefitted by this contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.215" offset="13472713">The law provides him the right to set his own contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.994" offset="13487864">He did get some benefits, but he was compelled both to take the benefits and the burdens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.946" offset="13507612">He had to pay initiation fees, dues.</text>

            <text syncTime="3346.849" offset="13531227">And so I think the benefits argument has been rejected in many instances, and I don't think it is a good argument that they are making.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.829" offset="13571142">The primary purpose of this Act is to protect the public interest and the policies of the Act by mitigating the effects of that violation and preventing future violation.</text>
