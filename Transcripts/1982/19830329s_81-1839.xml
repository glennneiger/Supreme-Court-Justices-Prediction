            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="92433">The judgment and opinion of the Court in Minneapolis Star &amp; Tribune against Minnesota Commission -- Commissioner of Revenue will be announced by Justice O'Connor.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="9.997" offset="132348">This case comes to us on appeal from the Supreme Court of Minnesota.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.712" offset="151261">Minnesota imposes a sales tax on most retail sales but not on the sales of goods to be used as components in the production of other goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.249" offset="189400">The state also imposes a complimentary use tax on goods purchased out-of-state for use in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.513" offset="218448">Publications are exempt from the sales tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.006" offset="232449">In 1971, however, the state legislature amended the use tax provision to impose a tax on all ink and paper purchased by publications.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.296" offset="277589">Publications became the only producers required to pay a tax on the purchase of components.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.833" offset="303711">The state later amended that provision again to exempt from tax the first $100,000 worth of ink and paper consumed by a publication in a calendar year.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.322" offset="353657">As a result, only a handful of newspapers incurred any liability at all for the ink and paper tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.410" offset="381974">And the appellant, Minneapolis Star &amp; Tribune paid roughly two thirds of the taxes collected.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.658" offset="407052">It brought this action to seek a refund of the taxes paid alleging a violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.175" offset="441115">The Minneapolis Supreme Court upheld the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.290" offset="453550">We now reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.546" offset="462536">Minnesota's ink and paper tax is a special tax that singles out the press for treatment different from that of other taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.503" offset="498376">Special taxation of this type was among the concerns of the framers of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.544" offset="526588">And it necessarily places a burden upon the rights protected by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.071" offset="548635">Unless the state presents a governmental interest that could not be achieved without the burden on First Amendment rights, and that is sufficient to counterbalance the burden, its tax cannot survive review.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.340" offset="605791">Minnesota has asserted no such interest here.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.139" offset="620942">Further, Minnesota's tax is objectionable because the structure of the exemptions is tailored to target a few publications to bear the burden of the tax while excusing all others.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.017" offset="668485">Again, the state has not offered an adequate justification for this burden on First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.109" offset="696802">Justice Blackmun joins the opinion except footnote 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.012" offset="712475">Justice White has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting part.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.191" offset="733164">Justice Rehnquist has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
