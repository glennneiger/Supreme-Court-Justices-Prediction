            <text syncTime="11.356" offset="195471">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="18.212" offset="222951">The issue in this case is whether gravel deposits which are susceptible to commercial exploitation are reserved to the United States under the Mineral Reservation and the Stock-Raising Homestead Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.435" offset="275823">Respondent, Western Nuclear, owns a uranium mine about 12 miles south of Jeffrey City, Wyoming, a company town where its workers live.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.743" offset="325038">It also mills the uranium a mile or two northeast of the town.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.397" offset="347608">From the time in the early 1950s when Western Nuclear first located in this area, it acquired gravel for its various needs in Lander, Wyoming, about 65 miles away, and in Casper, Wyoming, about 85 miles away.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.394" offset="423676">In 1975, finding that method of acquisition a little expensive, it acquired part of some land about a mile north of Jeffrey City where there was a deposit of gravel.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.237" offset="490968">Respondent thereafter mined about 43,000 cubic yards of gravel from that deposit, or about 60,000 tons, which it used for making cement to line the sides of its mineshafts, for concrete aggregate for lining the streets and the sidewalks in Jeffrey City and for building roads on which to haul its ore.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.256" offset="603085">The land on which the gravel deposit was located had been patented in 1926, under the Stock-Raising Homestead Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="139.407" offset="707680">The Homestead claim which was at stake in Layman against Ellis had been first located in 1925.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.977" offset="737982">When the Bureau of Land Management learned of the appropriation of the gravel deposit, it informed respondent that its appropriation of the gravel was a trespass against the mineral interests of the United States reserved under the Stock-Raising Homestead Act and, after undertaking an appraisal of the property, concluded that respondent was liable in the amount of $13,000 for royalties for the gravel taken.</text>

            <text syncTime="210.670" offset="992728">Until 1955 these kinds of gravel deposits were not sold but were locatable under the Mining Act of 1872 and they--</text>

            <text syncTime="222.928" offset="1041733">And so anybody who wanted to acquire these deposits could just go on the land and take them with... after making accommodations with the homesteader.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.833" offset="1077364">After 1955, in fact, in 1957, promptly after the Common Varieties Act, which permitted sale of these deposits was passed, the Solicitor of Interior in a Solicitor's opinion addressed to the Director in Denver said that passage of this act shouldn't be understood to have relinquished the government's interest in gravel deposits on Stock-Raising Homestead Act lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.353" offset="1195438">All that the Common Varieties Act did was to change the method of disposal from location to sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.089" offset="1218426">And although it's difficult to say to what extent the people seeking gravel deposits on Stock-Raising Homestead Act lands actually get permission of the Department because of the way the records are kept in the resource area... there isn't any... there isn't any separate line on the form that they fill out to say what kind of lands gravel deposits are taken from... I notice that in the Trujillo case, on which respondent in the Court of Appeals relied, that the State of New Mexico in 1971 had acquired a permit from the Bureau of Land Management to acquire gravel deposits on Stock-Raising Homestead Act lands.</text>

            <text syncTime="324.176" offset="1446736">And it's also the case that the enforcement resources of the Bureau of Land Management are not such that they are able to police the use that's made of these deposits.</text>

            <text syncTime="1648.401" offset="6743637">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.055" offset="6758266">What we are attempting to ascertain in this case is whether or not the 1916 Congress specifically reserved gravel in its mineral reservation of all coal and other minerals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.795" offset="6813227">I think the case law and the legislative history is particularly important to look at, the condition of the country at the time and what Congress was intending to do when it passed the 1916 Stock-Raising Homestead Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.122" offset="6874563">You will recall that between 1900 and 1910 President Roosevelt withdrew approximately 150 million acres of public lands from entry, both agricultural and mineral.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.696" offset="6932868">Subsequent to that time, in 1907, President Roosevelt urged Congress to pass legislation which would provide for a distinct title to the surface and reserve to the government underlying fuel and minerals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.253" offset="6987098">Congress commenced passage of legislation in 1909.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.907" offset="7009668">The 1916 Stock-Raising Homestead Act was the last of the large land grants to settle the West, provided, as has been stated, for 640 acres rather than the normal 160 or 320, because that type of land, that barren semiarid West, required an acreage of that nature to support the plucky homesteader who could go out there and try to make a living.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.641" offset="7116666">Did Congress in 1916 intend to reserve gravel under that mineral reservation?</text>

            <text syncTime="1751.865" offset="7157521">Well, isn't the question a little broader than that?</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.015" offset="7166089">Did they intend to reserve everything except what was essential for the purposes of the grant; that is, grazing and farming, raising crops?</text>

            <text syncTime="1768.125" offset="7222618">--I think when one looks to the legislative history of the act, one sees it replete with the phrases: What we are attempting here is to settle up to one-fourth of the remaining public domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.766" offset="7273087">What the West needs is settlers, people, homes, communities, churches, railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.586" offset="7296388">The Stock-Raising Homestead Act was a means to that end.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.323" offset="7311330">It was a means to settle the West.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.890" offset="7317600">I don't believe the Stock-Raising Homestead Act was just a means to graze stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.061" offset="7338289">The cattle barons had been grazing stock on the Western lands, the public domain, long before 1916.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.465" offset="7363889">And in fact, the lands were overgrazed at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.850" offset="7377472">This was a means to get people out there, to tie them to communities, to build towns, to add to the tax rolls.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.487" offset="7400042">This was shortly after these Western Rocky Mountain states joined the Union, became states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.308" offset="7423343">They needed people to add to the tax rolls.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.760" offset="7433061">The only way to get that was to get them out there to build cities, to make improvements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.629" offset="7448630">I think that was the underlying purpose, the driving force behind the passage of the Stock-Raising Homestead Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3349.142" offset="13546654">The first is in the Court of Appeals, respondent's brief at page 2 said, in March of 1975 in order to obtain a ready and convenient source of gravel and for other purposes, Western Nuclear acquired in fee a substantial piece of ranch property which included the subject land.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.322" offset="13631395">The second point that I would like to make is there has been some uncertainty about the purpose and effect of the Materials Act of 1947 and its predecessor, the Act of 1944, for disposing of gravel which could not otherwise be disposed of.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.784" offset="13705165">Justice Rehnquist asked at the beginning of my argument whether the government claimed all gravel under its reservation in the Stock-Raising Homestead Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.373" offset="13743513">And I hesitated because until 1944 gravel in deposits, gravel useful for purposes of fill or riprap or uses like that rather than gravel useful for making concrete and hot-mix aggregate was not locatable under the mining laws and there was no way of disposing of that kind of gravel at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.309" offset="13855317">The reason I hesitated in saying that the government does... needn't claim all gravel in this case is that the kind of gravel which is at stake in this case is the kind of gravel that was locatable under the mining laws and could be disposed of before 1944.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.937" offset="13929818">Justice O'Connor, you asked whether the government was saying that this kind of gravel was not common variety gravel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.793" offset="13961270">The government does... the government admits that it was common variety gravel in the sense in which the 1955 Act uses the word "common variety".</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.982" offset="13998050">That is not to say that it was not locatable under the Mining Act of 1872.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.553" offset="14020306">The third point I would like to make relates to Justice Brennan's concern about this question not having been raised before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.207" offset="14042876">In the District Court the government stated... this is in the appendix to the respondent's brief in opposition... what the United States is concerned about are commercial gravel operations.</text>

            <text syncTime="3544.803" offset="14329283">--No, there was not a stipulation, although there was never an issue about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.755" offset="14345061">The Bureau of Land Management took the position that it was only salable gravel deposits that they were concerned with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.075" offset="14370347">They appraised the land and decided that the fair market value in that market for the gravel was 30 cents a cubic yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.848" offset="14401485">The Interior Board of Land Appeals, page 65A... 65A of the government's appendix... Interior Board of Land Appeals said that it is thus clear that gravel in a valuable deposit is a mineral reserve to the United States in patents issued under the Stock-Raising Homestead Act, and went on to say that the respondent had introduced no evidence which led it to question the appraisal which had been made by the Bureau of Land Management, and for that reason, because there was no factual evidence to contradict the appraisal, would not... would not give them a hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="3599.488" offset="14547980">In the Court of Appeals, the government's brief, as the first issue presented, said the issue is whether the District Court correctly concluded that the Stock-Raising Homestead Act in its legislative history show that Congress intended to reserve all gravel deposits susceptible to commercial exploitation on lands patented under the act.</text>
