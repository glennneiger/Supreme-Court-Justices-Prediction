            <text syncTime="102.819" offset="560031">There are two issues in this case today.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.114" offset="573197">The first issue is whether the district court ever had subject matter jurisdiction of this action--</text>

            <text syncTime="115.625" offset="611231">The second question is whether the California tax collection statute has been preempted by the provisions of the Employee Income Security Act of 1974, otherwise known as ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.447" offset="678522">This lawsuit began because various taxpayers were indebted to the State of California for income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.850" offset="712063">There is no question in this lawsuit concerning the validity of those taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.159" offset="737350">These various taxpayers were employed as laborers in the construction industry and were participants in a vacation plan covered by selected provisions of ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.809" offset="799939">The employers of these workers funded the vacation plan by contributing a certain amount per hour to the fund for each employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.025" offset="844766">The vacation fund paid out periodically the amount owing to each employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.380" offset="874232">In order to collect these workers' delinquent income taxes, the Franchise Tax Board of the State of California served what is called an order to withhold on the trustees of the vacation plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.062" offset="928984">This order to withhold is a type of levy authorized by the California statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.763" offset="955734">The trustees refused to honor the levy, alleging that the California statute had been preempted by ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.040" offset="992828">The Franchise Tax Board filed suit in Los Angeles Superior Court to enforce their levy and to obtain a declaration that future levies should be honored.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.034" offset="1048834">The trustees removed the case to federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.767" offset="1063776">The Franchise Tax Board brought a motion to remand, which was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.577" offset="1086973">The district court found on the merits for the Franchise Tax Board, that the statute had not been preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.371" offset="1122186">The Ninth Circuit reversed and found that the statute was preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.993" offset="1148726">One member of the panel of the Ninth Circuit dissented.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.069" offset="1168997">He found: first of all, that there was no subject matter jurisdiction; and secondly, that the statute had not been preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.940" offset="1204419">Before we discuss the merits of preemption, it is necessary to first discuss the issue of whether the district court ever had subject matter jurisdiction of this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.042" offset="1272860">California brought this action in state court and relied solely on state law to collect the delinquent taxes.</text>

            <text syncTime="370.166" offset="1629379">Well, I'm trying to... I suppose everybody would concede that if your claim had simply been that, you owe us the taxes because California statute XYZ says you do, give us judgment, that there is no... under the well-pleaded complaint doctrine, there is no raising of a federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.581" offset="1703045">But I'm wondering whether when you add to that a declaratory judgment prayer you don't, based on preemption, you don't perhaps raise a federal question.</text>

            <text syncTime="414.320" offset="1805967">The only way that federal law entered the case was by the defense of the Defendant, and the Franchise Tax Board simply anticipated that defense, and under the authorities of this Court--</text>

            <text syncTime="425.816" offset="1851943">Well, but didn't the complaint itself, though, refer to the question about whether ERISA preempted the levy and referred to the position on the face of the complaint taken by the trust fund, the trustees?</text>

            <text syncTime="445.244" offset="1929683">But again, that was simply their defense to the state cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.883" offset="1948282">The state was not relying on ERISA for anything in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.928" offset="1968449">ERISA entered the case as a defense, and under the authorities of this Court anticipating the Defendant's defense does not create federal subject matter jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.549" offset="2014947">We did not need federal law to collect our taxes or to receive a declaratory judgment under California law.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.576" offset="2047025">As I said, the trustees relied on ERISA as a defense to the California causes of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.650" offset="2091329">And again, as I said, this Court has held for many years that this defense does not create federal subject matter jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.585" offset="2123094">The trustees argue that they could have brought the action in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.270" offset="2141797">However, there are problems with this allegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.893" offset="2152246">First of all, they did not do that; and second of all, any action that they would have brought in federal court would have been barred by the provisions of 28 U.S.C. 1341, the Tax Injunction Act, which declares that no district court shall enjoin the collection of the tax where there is a plain, speedy and efficient remedy in state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.957" offset="2248586">This case should have been remanded to state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.726" offset="2259662">That court was competent to decide whether ERISA preempts the California statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.942" offset="2284426">If the trustees did not prevail in the California state court, they had the option of pursuing this matter ultimately to this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="547.688" offset="2339492">Before we leave jurisdiction, for the Tax Injunction Act to be applicable I suppose we have to determine that there was an adequate state remedy available.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.433" offset="2394454">And I wondered whether under California law the trustees, for example, could have challenged the levy, since the California statute seems to limit to only the taxpayers the right to challenge.</text>

            <text syncTime="598.261" offset="2541784">Had they paid the money over, they could have filed a claim with the State Board of Control, and if that claim were denied then they would have the right to bring an independent action against the Franchise Tax Board for conversion and litigate whether they should have turned over their funds.</text>

            <text syncTime="684.820" offset="2887959">Going to the principles of preemption, as this Court has stated many times preemption is not lightly to be presumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.098" offset="2929128">And regarding the police power of the State of California to collect the revenue, that power should not be preempted unless that was the clear and manifest intent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.874" offset="2968207">ERISA is primarily pension legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.357" offset="2986179">It comprehensively regulates pensions and mandates that those benefits will not be alienated.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.807" offset="3019930">By contrast, it only regulates welfare plans in the areas of recording and disclosure, fiduciary responsibility, and administration and enforcement; and it does not mandate a non-alienation provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.113" offset="3089206">The vacation plan at issue in this case is a welfare plan and not a pension plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.000" offset="3112717">ERISA's preemption provision is Section 514.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.264" offset="3133719">It provides that the provisions of Titles I and IV of ERISA shall supersede any and all state laws insofar as they relate to any benefit plan described.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.180" offset="3185441">The term "state" includes governmental entities which purport to regulate, directly or indirectly, the terms and conditions of benefit plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.317" offset="3233925">The Franchise Tax Board contends that preemption under 514 is not limitless.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.923" offset="3264436">Congress could not have intended to preempt all state laws which incidentally touch ERISA plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.685" offset="3295469">It is more reasonable to conclude that Congress only meant to preempt state laws that regulated in the same areas as ERISA or that interfered with the purposes of ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.382" offset="3354192">This interpretation is supported by the comments of Representative John Dent and Senator Harrison Williams, who said that the purpose of the preemption clause was to eliminate the threat of conflicting or inconsistent state and local regulation of employee benefit plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.953" offset="3432560">The California statute does not relate to vacation plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.152" offset="3453353">It does not regulate or mandate the terms and conditions of any plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.354" offset="3478117">It does not conflict with the purposes of ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.446" offset="3498493">The preemption section has recently been amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.100" offset="3517092">The background of this amendment begins with certain Hawaii statutes that required employers in Hawaii to provide health insurance benefits for their employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.860" offset="3572158">These laws were challenged by an employer in the case of Standard Oil versus Agsalud, where the employer argued that the health insurance laws were preempted by ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.527" offset="3622836">The Ninth Circuit agreed and this Court affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.399" offset="3642271">In order to save the concept of the Hawaii law, which was that all employees in the State of Hawaii be provided with health insurance by their employers, Congress amended Section 514.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.425" offset="3702457">This amendment exempts Hawaii's health insurance plan from preemption and states that nothing in the new exemption shall be construed to exempt from preemption any state tax law relating to employee benefit plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.792" offset="3775913">The words 514(a)(5), which deals exclusively with the Hawaii problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.520" offset="3846757">The words must also be interpreted within the context of the Agsalud case, where Hawaii unsuccessfully argued that the payment required from the employer was a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.608" offset="3907152">The words "tax law" in the amendment were apparently a response to what Hawaii was attempting to classify as a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.541" offset="3946859">The complete Section 514, the only place I believe it's set out in any of the briefs is in the amicus brief of the State of Connecticut on pages 10 and 11, which sets out the former Section 514 and the amendment, which are Sections (5) and (6).</text>
            <text syncTime="970.719" offset="4031600">The only pertinent comment in regard to tax laws in the legislative history with regard to the amendment comes from Senator Dole, who stated that the amendment was intended to exempt Hawaii's health plan from preemption, but preclude Hawaii from imposing tax liability on insurance premiums or benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.084" offset="4137030">If Senator Dole's comment on tax laws is the reason why the words "tax law" appear in the amendment, then the California statute does not fall within the real of Senator Dole's concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.610" offset="4191156">Moreover, there is evidence that the Hawaii amendment did not change the scope of Section 514.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.763" offset="4223757">According to the Senate Committee on Finance, the amendment</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.090" offset="4241102">"does not affect the status under the preemption provisions of ERISA of any state tax law relating to employee benefit plans. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.054" offset="4296899">In addition, the Conference Report explained that the amendment continues preemption of state law</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.659" offset="4327306">"with respect to matters governed by the reporting and disclosure and the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA, as well as certain provisions of the administration and enforcement rules of ERISA. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.716" offset="4387597">If the amendment is interpreted within the context of the Agsalud case and the legislative history of the Hawaii amendment, then the words 514.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.897" offset="4456246">It must also be noted that the amendment again uses the words "relate to".</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.566" offset="4482996">The California statute did not relate to benefit plans either before or after the Hawaii amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.328" offset="4514029">With these facts in mind, it is clear that the California statute is not affected by this amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.511" offset="4542764">The domestic relations cases have shown that it is necessary for the courts to define the limits of ERISA's preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.664" offset="4591352">Where courts have found a high public purpose, they have interpreted the preemption section accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.771" offset="4619773">In the area of domestic relations, almost all courts which have considered the problem have allowed ex-spouses and children to levy on pension funds for the collection of family maintenance or community property rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="1525.856" offset="6252112">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.680" offset="6267472">I will first address the jurisdictional issue which has been raised by the state in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.070" offset="6288997">The starting point for the Appellees is the unanimous decision of this Court almost 50 years ago through Mr. Justice Cardozo in the Gully case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.362" offset="6326196">In that case, Justice Cardozo warned that it would be futile to attempt to determine the issue of federal question jurisdiction in future cases without specific reference to the context of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.092" offset="6381053">In that case he suggested that the court apply a common sense accommodation of judgment to kaleidoscopic situation which characterize the law in other areas, such as the treatment of the problem of proximate cause in tort law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.977" offset="6440612">He advocated a selective process which picks the substantial federal causes out of the web and lays the others aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.910" offset="6472377">We believe the Court should have no difficulty in finding federal question jurisdiction in this case without doing violence to its precedents in cases such as Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad versus Mottley and other cases of that ilk.</text>

            <text syncTime="1598.966" offset="6544579">I think the federal question arose in the case, Your Honor, immediately when the complaint was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.308" offset="6569970">The complaint and the exhibits to the complaint lay out the federal dispute in great detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.382" offset="6590241">The Department of Labor's opinion is attached as an exhibit to the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.334" offset="6606019">It is incorporated by reference in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.240" offset="6617618">And in paragraph 20 of the complaint the state asks not merely for a collection of the tax delinquencies of the laborers; it rather asks for a declaration of the rights and obligations of all the parties, including the trustees and the trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.218" offset="6673624">That leads me into the first reason why federal question jurisdiction must exist in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1648.055" offset="6740916">It's in the body of the complaint and in the exhibits, not in the prayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.756" offset="6755753">Under some Ninth Circuit authorities, I might add, the prayer itself is not considered part of the text of the complaint, only the allegations of the complaint and the incorporated exhibits.</text>

            <text syncTime="1772.973" offset="7240586">If I may now turn to the first of my reasons why I think there is federal question jurisdiction here, under Section 502(a)(3) of ERISA Congress gave fiduciaries the right to bring suit to obtain a determination of rights and obligations under a trust agreement such as this or under ERISA itself, and provided that federal courts would have exclusive jurisdiction over such suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.324" offset="7330029">Now, it's the position of the trustees in this case that the Congressional intent is clear that federal courts decide these issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.852" offset="7364093">There would be no reason to provide for exclusive federal court jurisdiction of these cases unless Congress intended that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1810.739" offset="7391678">But the Tax Injunction Act, which Congress also passed, certainly would indicate that the district courts will not enjoin the state tax, and Grace Brethren says that applies to declaratory judgment as well.</text>

            <label>Mr. James P. Watson</label>
            <text syncTime="1826.608" offset="7455103">I was going to get to that later, but let me address that now, since Your Honor brings it up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.108" offset="7473180">The Tax Injunction Act, as Your Honor has already commented, contains an exception requiring that a plain, speedy and effective remedy exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.962" offset="7504527">Otherwise it will be of no effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.430" offset="7514454">In this case, as the Court already noted in colloquy with counsel, the plain, speedy and effective remedy exists, all right, for the taxpayer, but it doesn't exist for the fiduciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.458" offset="7550503">Nor does the taxpayer have the incentive to raise the legal issues the fiduciaries would.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.549" offset="7570878">We don't know whether these taxpayers owe these taxes or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.017" offset="7584775">As far as I am aware, they probably do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.595" offset="7595120">If they have a claim against the state, it's only that we don't owe the tax, we already paid it in the year in which it was due.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.296" offset="7617899">They have no incentive to go out and hire a lawyer and say, just a minute here, these are trust fund assets and you're breaking the trust agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.495" offset="7642663">There is no reason to suppose that they would even have standing to raise such an issue in a state administrative proceeding for refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.977" offset="7672651">So it's clear that the Tax Injunction Act doesn't provide the plain, speedy and effective remedy to the trustees in this case that it provides to the taxpayer, and it's also clear that the taxpayer probably would not raise the fiduciary issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.019" offset="7720821">A second reason, however, exists to provide that the Tax Injunction Act would not apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.704" offset="7747570">In Mitchum versus Foster, a 1972 decision of this Court through Mr. Justice Stewart, the Court held that in cases of conflicts between federal statutes providing for injunctive remedies and the general federal anti-injunction statute, that 28 U.S. Code 2283, the Court must look to see whether application of the general anti-injunction statute would frustrate the Congressional purpose in enacting the subsequent law providing for injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.317" offset="7865957">That's exactly what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.645" offset="7875257">It's clear, it seems to me, that Congress intended trustees to get equitable relief, declaratory judgments, injunctive relief, and did not specifically address the issue of tax laws, although they must have realized tax laws were one possible area of preemption, and applying the Tax Injunction Act to prevent them from getting that kind of relief in this case would frustrate the clear Congressional intent to permit them to get instruction from the federal courts about how to properly operate the trust under ERISA.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="1961.337" offset="7994062">Well, Mr. Watson, perhaps Congress thought that tax laws weren't preempted.</text>

            <text syncTime="1965.349" offset="8010153">That's another possibility, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.739" offset="8023632">But the legislative history suggests strongly to the contrary, and although this gets into my preemption argument, it's clear from the preemption statute itself, which contains its own exceptions for banking laws, insurance laws, securities laws, it doesn't mention tax laws and it doesn't mention state levies, and it certainly doesn't mention individual creditors, even if they are individual government bodies acting as creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.731" offset="8111613">That isn't in the statute, and, as counsel for the state pointed out, the statute has recently been amended, after the Ninth Circuit ruled in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.290" offset="8145886">If Congress wanted to change this statute and say, the Ninth Circuit made a mistake, we want to make it clear that state levy laws... not tax laws now, but levy laws, because that's what we're talking about here... are not preempted, they could have added that in when they amended 514 this year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.017" offset="8208788">They did not do so, and this Court in the has dealt with the issue of Congressional silence in a way which I think would suggest in this case that, even if Congress didn't know in 1974 that they were preempting state levy laws, they surely must know now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.465" offset="8266571">And of course, there's been litigation in other courts about this matter also indicating that ERISA preemption is very broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.540" offset="8294888">So surely the Congressional intent is tacitly in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.740" offset="8319652">Moreover, there is copious and I think even redundant quotes from the sponsors of the original ERISA bill set forth in the briefs which show how broadly they felt the preemption statute was to be read.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.860" offset="8368135">They did not suggest that all common law remedies would never apply to the trust funds, but they did suggest, as in the collective bargaining cases, like Lincoln Mills and Aero Lodge and cases of that kind, that a federal common law would be developed by the federal court to govern this type of situation, and exactly that type of thing ought to be done in the debtor-creditor type situation we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.257" offset="8457683">We're not saying that federal courts might not develop a federal common law authorized by ERISA that would permit some kind of levy in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.333" offset="8490075">But that hasn't been done yet and it can't be done under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.988" offset="8500628">That's our main point.</text>

            <text syncTime="2089.284" offset="8505853">May I ask, before you get too far away from the jurisdictional question, on the question of an adequate state California remedy, are you telling me that, supposing the state had levied, had a case of mistaken identity, for example, that a person that they said owed them taxes was not really a beneficiary of the trust or something like that... wouldn't the trustees have a remedy in resisting the levy in some state proceeding that would be prompt and efficient?</text>

            <text syncTime="2123.192" offset="8641481">Now, I concede to the Court that probably when the California statute was drafted nobody thought about trust funds like this, but they surely must have thought about third party creditors the state might be chasing after in order to collect tax funds, and apparently they decided to leave it up to the taxpayer to fight his own battle.</text>

            <text syncTime="2272.617" offset="9239162">One of the difficulties in this case is that the state has raised the Tax Injunction Act in its reply brief filed just one week ago, so the Board does not have the benefit of full briefs from both parties on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.941" offset="9280436">Had it been raised in the original brief, I would have addressed the matter in detail, and some of the questions that Justice Stevens has asked suggest that perhaps the matter ought to be looked into in greater detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.859" offset="9320142">Let me pass, if I might, though, to a second important reason why federal question jurisdiction ought to exist here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.419" offset="9346369">As I mentioned a moment ago in response to one of Justice Marshall's questions, it's clear at least under Ninth Circuit law that this trust agreement is a collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.526" offset="9382836">It was signed by the employers and the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.056" offset="9392971">It is part and parcel of the collective bargaining process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.850" offset="9408122">This Court has made it clear in Section 301 suits, in Avco and Boys Market and other suits, that the federal interest in the collective bargaining process is pervasive and, even when such suits on common law theories are brought in state courts under Section 301, they can be removed by the defendant party to federal court and once in federal court they must stay there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.967" offset="9492550">That's in the Aero case and that's cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.154" offset="9505298">This same overwhelming federal interest is present in this case, not only because this is a form of collective bargaining agreement, but also because of the very comprehensive umbrella of ERISA and the very clear statements in the legislative history and in Section 502 that Congress wanted these questions resolved in federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.144" offset="9585232">Now, there's a third reason why federal question jurisdiction exists here, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.080" offset="9601010">In 1974 in the Oneida case this Court held federal question jurisdiction to exist in a suit brought under a simple common law ejectment theory in New York by an Indian tribe, because the Court found that inevitably the federal question would arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.903" offset="9664331">It was not a speculative issue, it was not something lurking in the background like Gully.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.354" offset="9682095">It was central in the total focus of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.651" offset="9695260">That is exactly what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.540" offset="9702888">Some of the lower courts have used the so-called pivotal question doctrine to find federal question jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.427" offset="9726398">In this case the federal question isn't the pivotal question; it's the only question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.940" offset="9744475">There is no other question in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.362" offset="9750117">The trustees have no other defense to the payment of these moneys, we don't know whether these taxpayers owe the money, and the state of California gives the state the right to collect and leaves it to the taxpayer to fight it out once they've gotten the money.</text>

            <text syncTime="2588.865" offset="10504116">Perhaps this case looks and sounds less weighty because we're not talking about seizing the money payable for surgical benefits for a laborer's wife who has been in the hospital and he doesn't have any other money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.017" offset="10548733">Since it's a vacation trust, it looks like a check that's payable to him for a relatively inconsequential purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.419" offset="10578408">But by letting the state invade this fund now for this reason, the Court will open the door to having the health and welfare benefits taken, the educational benefits taken, and any other benefits that creditors want to latch onto.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.492" offset="10626682">And if the Ohio court's theory were followed... and they followed the dissent of the Ninth Circuit... this would not be limited to state agencies.</text>

            <text syncTime="2678.250" offset="10861680">This Court left those findings undisturbed, and since subject matter jurisdiction is never waived I can only conclude that this Court was satisfied that there was an adequate jurisdictional ground.</text>

            <text syncTime="2693.165" offset="10921343">However, the removal statute provides that cases which could have been brought in the district court which are arising under federal law may be removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.348" offset="10970140">And since the preemption issue we believe furnishes the adequate basis for, as this complaint came to the Court and as it was pleaded, the "arising under" jurisdiction, we don't think there's a problem with that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2795.984" offset="11332615">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.201" offset="11345468">I would like now to move to the preemption phase of the case in the remaining ten minutes of my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.432" offset="11370441">As Mr. Justice Powell has noted in many opinions for this Court, the primary source for interpreting the statute is the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.493" offset="11398653">In this case, we believe the provisions of the statute, both the preemption provision and Section 403, which limits the right of the trustees as fiduciaries to spend money for the purposes set forth in the trust agreement and for the reasonable costs of defraying trust expenses, are very, very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.455" offset="11474512">If there were any doubt about the breadth of the preemption provision, we think the legislative history wipes away that doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.717" offset="11499590">And I will not take the Court's time this afternoon to quote that history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.591" offset="11515055">It is extensive and in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.997" offset="11520697">The state suggests that, as in the marital dissolution cases, there ought to be some kind of implicit exception for state tax levies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.461" offset="11554552">They say that state courts and some federal courts have found such an exception in cases where pension benefits and other benefits had to be divided between former spouses to a dissolved marriage, and they say, why not us as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.629" offset="11607215">And we think there are two answers to that: One, it is not clear from the opinions of this Court that the marital dissolution cases are correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.406" offset="11642323">Although this Court summarily dismissed the Campa case for want of a substantial federal question, there is no authoritative opinion of this Court approving the reasoning of the lower court decisions in the marital dissolution cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.525" offset="11694777">Second, as was brought out in the colloquy between counsel for the state and one of the members of this Court, there is a distinct difference between dividing benefits among co-beneficiaries of one of these trust funds and giving those intended benefits to a creditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.223" offset="11757575">And in a case like this, the state is nothing more--</text>

            <text syncTime="2905.549" offset="11770950">What is the difference?</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.018" offset="11772831">What is the significant difference as far as this case is concerned?</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.330" offset="11785997">Well, the significant difference as far as this case is concerned is that it can be argued, and I say not necessarily rightly, but it can be argued, that the purpose of the trust instrument is met when you give the benefits to co-beneficiaries, a husband and wife, particularly in a community property state where they jointly own the whole community property, with California as a community property state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.055" offset="11868961">When you give the benefits to a third party creditor not interested in benefits under the trust fund, simply trying to latch onto those assets to satisfy some alleged debt incurred by one of the beneficiaries, you are defeating the purpose of the trust in a way you are not doing when you give the benefits to another person, a spouse, a husband or a wife, who shares those benefits under California law with the named beneficiary under the trust fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.497" offset="11970735">Well, I suppose if there were a levy on a life insurance policy that had a large cash value and a lot of beneficiaries in a community property state, it wouldn't be any different, would it?</text>

            <text syncTime="3021.550" offset="12234885">But since it's a private arrangement and one in which Congress has not injected itself, the federal interest is not there.</text>

            <text syncTime="3059.690" offset="12387440">It is not unusual, as the Court knows from the Kaiser-Mullins case, for Congress to comment on decisions by the Court of Appeals and lower federal courts, and the legislative history in Kaiser-Mullins, many lower court decisions are cited.</text>

            <text syncTime="3141.455" offset="12714493">The simple answer to that is in Section 403 of the Act, which provides that the trustees may pay out trust assets for the purposes described in the trust document and also for defraying the expenses of operating the trust.</text>

            <text syncTime="3168.787" offset="12823894">Those are clearly permissible purposes, however, that don't raise the preemption problem here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.880" offset="12844269">Finally, if I may turn to one other question that was raised before the break, Justice Stevens had asked, well, couldn't the trustees get some kind of remedy in state court using some kind of common law theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.343" offset="12890036">Even if the statute provides only the taxpayer has the remedy, surely the trustees can go in and challenge this whole setup.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.310" offset="12913964">The quick answer to that, and it gets us back to the jurisdictional issue, is that Section 502 requires that the trustees, when they seek instruction from the court about their fiduciary responsibilities or their responsibilities under ERISA, it requires that those suits be brought in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.084" offset="12981046">So if the trustees in this case had brought their own suit against the state in state court, the state would have had a total defense: the state court simply does not have jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.689" offset="13015423">Again, it gets us back to why this must be a federal court case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.157" offset="13029321">Finally, and I will conclude on this point, the state has suggested, in referring to the marital dissolution cases, that there's that implicit exception in the Act; perhaps, as some lower courts have stated and suggested, other high public purposes deserve an equal exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.572" offset="13095045">My response to that is simply, there is nothing in the legislative history to suggest that Congress intended that every high public purpose would create an implicit exemption to the very clear preemption statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.788" offset="13139871">A second response to that is: How many high public purposes are there and who is to decide what they are?</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.362" offset="13166202">If the Court goes along with the idea that levying on trust assets to satisfy tax delinquencies of the beneficiaries is a high public purpose, we will see many more cases before this Court and lower courts where people are asserting that their purposes are equally worthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.512" offset="13226806">That is surely not what the framers of the Act intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.214" offset="13237569">It is very foreign to the purpose of the ERISA statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3290.863" offset="13312175">It provides that the trustees may bring an action seeking equitable or other relief, including injunctive relief... which gets us to the Tax Injunction Act problem, as it may conflict in this language with that... to determine their rights and obligations under the trust instrument or under ERISA itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.184" offset="13385422">Now, in the case Your Honor posited the only defense the trustees have, the only one we're asserting here, is that ERISA prevents us from paying out this money to third party creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.382" offset="13426277">That is exactly the kind of suit, exactly the kind of question, that Section 502(e) says federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction of.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.473" offset="13462640">And if a state court proceeding were allowed to get at that kind of critical issue under ERISA despite the exclusive jurisdiction language in the statute, the whole purpose of the statute, to keep these very sensitive questions in federal court, would be completely frustrated.</text>

            <text syncTime="3457.328" offset="13977983">It is our contention that they could have litigated that issue of preemption in a defensive manner in the lawsuit which we already brought against them.</text>
