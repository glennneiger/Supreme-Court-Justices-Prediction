            <text syncTime="10.915" offset="188454">Mr. Solicitor General, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="14.335" stopTime="543.358">
            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="14.335" offset="202142">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.584" offset="215204">The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 directs the Secretary of Transportation to issue appropriate federal motor vehicle safety standards which shall be practicable, shall meet the need for safety, and shall be stated in objective terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.843" offset="284167">Over the 17 years since that statute was enacted, a succession of Transportation Secretaries have tried to find the best way to implement its broad authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.479" offset="330769">The optimum solution to the problem of occupant crash protection has been particularly elusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.946" offset="360653">Since 1967 standard 208, which deals with the problem of occupant crash protection, has required the installation of manual seatbelts.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.392" offset="402449">Passive restraints, which require no independent occupant action for their effectiveness, were first incorporated into standard 208 in a series of amendments adopted between 1970 and 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.669" offset="451455">One of the permitted options under those amendments was a manual belt system coupled with an ignition interlock.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.370" offset="482280">However, public irritation with interlock systems led Congress in 1974 to prohibit them by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.163" offset="509447">In 1976 Secretary Coleman attempted to deal with what he considered to be the root of the problem: widespread public resistance to mandatory passive restraints.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.113" offset="561274">He proposed a demonstration project involving up to 500,000 cars installed with passive restraints in order to smooth the way for their public acceptance at a later date.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.858" offset="608294">Secretary Coleman did not reject mandatory passive restraints as a long-range solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.294" offset="630028">He simply concluded that they would be more effective if preceded in time by an effort to change the public's attitude about them.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.244" offset="665764">His successor disagreed, as was, in our view, his prerogative.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.677" offset="683527">Within a manner of months, Secretary Adams dispensed with the Coleman demonstration project and instead adopted the modified standard 208 at issue here, which made passive restraints mandatory for large cars beginning with the 1982 model year and all cars beginning with the 1984 model year.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.124" offset="761372">While it permitted manufacturers to choose between two basic systems, air bags or passive belts, it was assumed at that time that about 60 percent of the cars would be equipped with air bags.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.759" offset="811840">Four years after the Adams decision, Secretary Lewis rescinded the mandatory passive restraint features of standard 208.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.022" offset="844964">He based his decisions on three findings:</text>
            <text syncTime="177.413" offset="854472">First, that because of the intervening to small cars, not one percent... not 60 percent, but only one percent of all cars would be equipped with air bags;--</text>
            <text syncTime="189.095" offset="901179">Second, that in complying then with standard 208 as it then stood, the seat belts that would be installed in the overwhelming majority of new cars would be detachable, and that once detached would be the functional equivalent of manual belts;--</text>
            <text syncTime="205.306" offset="966067">And third, that there was substantial uncertainty about the usage rate of these detachable belts convertible to manual belts.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.661" offset="1003475">Under those circumstances, NHTSA could not reliably predict whether increased use because of detachable belts would fall closer to zero percent or closer to five percent or ten percent, and for those reasons, together with the possible adverse safety effects from public reaction to what the public might perceive to be another expensive example of ineffective regulation, the agency could not conclude that the automatic restraints as then stated met the need for safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.226" offset="1121757">The Court of Appeals took no issue with the first two of these findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.429" offset="1142551">It described them as reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.977" offset="1148715">But it said that the third step turned the question on its head.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.348" offset="1166270">The court conceded the factual issue of probable seat belt usage was one which no one could predict with certainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.752" offset="1199811">Nevertheless, it held that once the agency had selected the passive restraint course of action in 1977, the presumption no longer ran in favor of the agency judgment, but rather in favor of the very regulation which the agency had concluded did not meet the statutory objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.524" offset="1290926">The effect of this unprecedented holding is truly starting.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.006" offset="1316840">It effectively deprives an administrative agency of its authority to regulate in conditions of uncertainty by making predictive judgments to resolve that uncertainty, judgments which in many cases, including this one, lie at the very heart of the administrative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.027" offset="1400954">By definition, where predictive judgments must be made in uncertain conditions, as they must here, the location of the burden will usually be determinative.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.646" offset="1451422">This case illustrates the mischief of shifting that burden once the agency proposes a regulation, and here is the reason why.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.552" offset="1491024">There are several views concerning which path leads to the best occupant restraint system.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.892" offset="1516415">Over the 17 years that Secretaries of Transportation have struggled with that problem, there have been two major, enduring, and overarching issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.886" offset="1564376">The first is, how effective will the passive restraint system really be.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.151" offset="1585483">Secretary Adams in 1977 concluded that 60 percent of all cars would be equipped with air bags under his proposal and that this would be highly effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.567" offset="1627070">By 1981 the circumstances had changed dramatically.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.878" offset="1640340">It was clear that compliance would consist of easily detachable belts, and Secretary Lewis concluded that under those new circumstance the requirements created by standard 208 as it then stood would not be effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.905" offset="1692480">There has always been a second broad issue, separate and very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.775" offset="1723932">And it is: Assuming that there is to be a passive restraint requirement at some point in time, which of two possible approaches should the agency emphasize first in time?</text>
            <text syncTime="410.361" offset="1786312">Do you push ahead first with hardware requirements or do you emphasize first changes in public attitude?</text>
            <text syncTime="420.625" offset="1827377">The right answers to those two controlling questions depend on the resolution of multiple uncertainties, technological uncertainties and behavioral uncertainties.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.335" offset="1890175">Someone has to perform the necessary task of sorting out those uncertainties, balancing the relevant considerations on all sides, and then making a judgment concerning which alternatives ought to be pursued and in what order.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.859" offset="1952242">It is equally clear, I submit, that that job, making predictive judgments in conditions of uncertainty, belongs to the administrative agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.139" offset="2001352">Standard 208 has been in existence since 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.606" offset="2023295">It's been amended many times.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.336" offset="2034162">After more than a decade of evolving experimental administrative efforts and continuing efforts by the Courts of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and also for the District of Columbia, there is nothing in law and nothing in common sense that suggests that that evolution should be frozen as of the 1977 amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.485" offset="2122769">In 1976 Secretary Coleman concluded that the best way to implement the statute was to attempt first to change human attitudes.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.277" offset="2161953">Was he right?</text>
            <text syncTime="505.388" offset="2166342">Was that the best solution?</text>
            <text syncTime="507.182" offset="2173551">Reasonable persons will differ.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.586" offset="2187135">But what ought to be clear to everyone, I submit, is that the Coleman choice of alternative did not preclude Secretary Adams from choosing another alternative without first bearing the probably impossible burden of disproving the predictive assumptions underlying the Coleman decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.281" offset="2269995">And for the same reason, in 1981 Secretary Lewis did not rule out the possibility of passive restraints as a long-range solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.294" offset="2301969">All options are still available.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.811" offset="2308030">All options are still open.</text>

            <text syncTime="543.358" offset="2318270">Mr. Lee, may I ask you one question.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.166" offset="2329450">Is it your view that the standard to be applied in deciding whether a rescission was proper is the same as the standard to be applied in whether or not to adopt a regulation in the first instance?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="558.492" stopTime="624.385">
            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="558.492" offset="2378769">My answer, Justice Stevens, is yes, they're very close, but I need to modify it in this one way.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.785" offset="2411997">The standard is arbitrariness and capriciousness, is it arbitrary and capricious.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.297" offset="2429969">And as I read the cases that have been handed down from this Court, it requires that the agency take into account and make its predictive judgments concerning all the information it has before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.494" offset="2490782">Now, in the course of having explored one path, there will be some information that the agency has to take into account, and it must take that into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.738" offset="2539788">But at the end of the day, two things: Number one, it's still the arbitrary and capricious standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.877" offset="2560373">It's a question of whether they've acted irrationally, and the presumption still runs in favor of the propriety of agency action.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.094" offset="2585241">And second, in the great majority of instances, and certainly I would say in this one, the standard will be about the same for not adopting a regulation in the first place or rescinding one.</text>

            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="817.976" offset="3416771">The answer is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.553" offset="3419070">The answer is no, and the reason is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.457" offset="3434639">The Court of Appeals holding to the contrary that there was the obligation to consider these other alternatives... and incidentally, the details of those alternatives will be discussed more thoroughly by Mr. Cutler... rests on the Court of Appeals' assumption that passive restraints are required by the statute, So that if detachable belts wouldn't do, then the court has... then the agency has an obligation to go on and consider some other form of passive restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.195" offset="3549578">In fact, it is clear that the statute has never required passive restraints.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.803" offset="3572043">The only source in law which ever provided for passive restraints is an agency regulation, and the agency has statutory authority to revoke its own regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.254" offset="3613839">The only Congressional mandate is to enact regulations which are practical, meet the need for safety, and are stated in objective terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.688" offset="3639543">And that leaves a very broad leeway to the administrative agency as to the kinds of standards to adopt in implementation of that broad standard, and that includes the time order according to which either one alternative will be considered, and none has been foreclosed by what Secretary Lewis his done.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.475" offset="3734733">Now let me make one final point, and it bears, Justice O'Connor, on this emphasis on alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.237" offset="3761796">The one thing that that emphasis on alternatives that is made both by the Court of Appeals and also the Respondents bears out is that it really underscores and confirms the fact that the situation as it stood in 1981 was not satisfactory, and that the Secretary was quite right not to let it simply drift.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.009" offset="3844866">The telling fact is that by 1981 it was clear that the 1977 assumption was wrong, standard 208 as then written was not going to do the job, and under those circumstances it was not irrational for the Secretary to rescind, and that is all that he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.206" offset="3921666">The real criticism that has been leveled against him is that he didn't then go on to pursue alternatives X, Y and Z.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.466" offset="3954684">In fact, no alternative has been foreclosed, but that is a separate issue from the only issue before the Court, which is the rescission of a particular form of passive restraint when passive restraints are not mandated by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.539" offset="4018946">The Court of Appeals itself conceded that the Secretary could suspend the regulation, though he could not rescind.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.115" offset="4053323">That I submit is a labeling distinction without a substantive difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.252" offset="4069832">Regardless of the label, the Secretary had the authority, once he concluded we were on the wrong path, not to continue down that path.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lloyd N. Cutler</label>
            <text syncTime="1004.773" offset="4163873">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.382" offset="4174322">I will cover the second ground of the Court of Appeals decision to set aside the agency's action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.911" offset="4200444">Before doing so, I'd like to supplement the Solicitor General's response to Justice Stevens and Justice O'Connor by saying that if there was any obligation on the agency to explain its conduct, its decision, it was an obligation to give reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.872" offset="4280275">Those reasons did not have to be facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.855" offset="4292291">They could just as well be statements of uncertainties about facts, particularly facts that went to the agency's own predictive judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.208" offset="4333669">They didn't have to find facts; they had merely to conclude that they faced uncertainties about their predictive judgments, in order to rescind the standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.988" offset="4372748">As to the issue of alternatives, a majority of the court ruled that the passive restraint requirement was not justified... a majority of the court ruled that even if the passive restraint requirement was not justified as written, the agency should have considered other alternative versions before rescinding this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.305" offset="4478074">And the majority discussed three such alternatives:</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.770" offset="4495942">One was requiring that if passive belts were used to comply they be continuous rather than detachable;--</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.486" offset="4522795">Second, requiring compliance by air bags only;--</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.159" offset="4537424">And third, reviving Secretary Coleman's voluntary demonstration program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.533" offset="4558949">None of these three alternatives was listed in the agency's April 1981 notice of proposed rulemaking that ended with the rescission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.512" offset="4598864">That notice did request comments on a number of alternative actions, but those did not include the ones advanced by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.833" offset="4640138">And under those circumstances, we submit it would have been improper for the agency to adopt any of the different proposals later advanced by the Court of Appeals before issuing a further notice and providing opportunity for comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.518" offset="4702936">And we submit further that the court should not have reordered the agency's own priorities so as to require it to consider other alternatives before rescinding this prospective regulation rather than after doing so, as the agency has said it would do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.916" offset="4784542">And even if it would be appropriate for a court to remand in some circumstances because an agency had failed to consider other alternatives, we would submit that those circumstances do not exist here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.111" offset="4845251">The Court of Appeals relied primarily on the alternative of the non-detachable passive belt, sometimes called in these statements in briefs the continuous passive belt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.185" offset="4893525">This alternative, though, is one that the agency did consider fully in the decision under review, and its reasons for rejecting it were rational, convincing and plainly within its expert discretion in applying the statutory criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.241" offset="4961757">These reasons were the safety need for easy emergency egress, the public fear of entrapment by attached belts in a crash, and public and Congressional resistance to use-compelling features in passive restraint systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.860" offset="5032288">And both the Respondents and, we submit, the Court of Appeals were wrong to suggest that the non-detachable belt, so-called, was an obvious alternative that had already been proven acceptable to the public in practice and had clearly increased belt usage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.291" offset="5101982">Until 1978 this very standard required that if a passive belt system were used the belt must be readily detachable by the passenger to permit escape in an emergency, for example a crash in which the door anchoring the belt mechanism could not be opened, or a turnover.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.546" offset="5187037">In '78 GM obtained agency approval to experiment with continuous spool-release passive shoulder belts and they equipped the 1980 Chevette with a three-point spool-release belt as a customer option.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.600" offset="5271256">But it proved unpopular with the public, despite a million dollar advertising campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.096" offset="5297169">Only 13,000 were sold out of over 400,000 Chevettes... that is about three percent... even though the option was offered for most of the time without charge and salesmen were offered a $25 bonus if they could persuade a customer to take one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.169" offset="5373551">Moreover, that 1980 Chevette belt was in fact detachable to simplify emergency egress, and if you look at the drawing of the belt, which is at... it's GM's drawing at page 2A of the appendix to the NAII brief... it's the red brief, Justice Stevens... you will see that where the lap portion attaches to the lower door there is a detachable push-button buckle, and when it's detached the entire three-point belt goes slack.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.966" offset="5508657">The shoulder portion stays in place and annoys the occupant, but the system as a whole is inoperable, either as a shoulder belt or a three-point belt, until it's reattached.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.196" offset="5573649">The record has data on the public acceptability and usage of only three passive belt systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.268" offset="5613878">There's this 1980 Chevette I just mentioned, there's the '78 and '79 Chevettes, and the VW Rabbits, which had a shoulder belt system only, protected by an ignition interlock, and as the Solicitor General has said, public annoyance with that interlock in '74 had driven Congress to forbid the agency from requiring... from issuing any standard that required or permitted the use of an ignition interlock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.909" offset="5760477">So that option was just not available to the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.126" offset="5777300">Even though ignition interlocks did substantially increase belt usage even for active belts in the '74-'75 period and for passive belts, it's just not an option that Congress has permitted the agency to use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.103" offset="5841248">In addition, it's important to note, as the agency did, that there is an important self-selection factor that explains the high usage rates of these passive belt systems guarded by interlocks or otherwise, and that is these customers voluntarily chose cars with passive belt systems when they had a choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.419" offset="5950544">Even so, a substantial number of those customers found ways to disarm the belt system afterward, and in the case of the Chevette 1980 more than half of the customers, according to a telephone survey cited by NAII, said they would not buy that same system again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.863" offset="6040301">Let me turn briefly to the alternative of requiring compliance by air bags only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.813" offset="6068095">The agency has repeatedly found that a substantial part of the driving public still feels uneasy about air bags.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.012" offset="6104875">That concern was reflected in the 1974 amendments, where Congress set up a warning flag by requiring that any standard requiring the use of an air bag had to be subjected to a Congressional veto procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.962" offset="6168719">It was reflected in Secretary Coleman's '77 plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.957" offset="6188676">It was the very public resistance to the air bag that led him to defer any mandatory passive restraint regulation until after a large-scale voluntary experiment had first been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.718" offset="6243742">And finally I come to the Coleman experiment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.465" offset="6258684">the essence of that plan was voluntariness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.200" offset="6273626">It expressly provided that the plan would be cancelled if the agency either proposed or issued a passive restraint standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.601" offset="6315213">So that the first step, if anyone was even to think of reviving the Coleman plan, would be to rescind this present regulation, which would have frustrated any Coleman plan and which also would have resulted in 99 percent of the cars having detachable passive belts rather than air bags.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.718" offset="6395671">And the agency, when it did do just that, announced that it plans to undertake new steps to promote the continued development and production of air bags.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.292" offset="6441960">Mr. Chief Justice, if I may I'd like to make one final point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.070" offset="6457111">The Respondents claim that the automobile industry has not done its part to improve occupant restraint protection and the usage of restraint systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.190" offset="6509564">We submit the record before you is to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.814" offset="6524089">Most manufacturers offered active seat belts before the Safety Act was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.281" offset="6550002">The auto companies have lobbied vigorously and have succeeded in obtaining mandatory child restraint usage laws in 33 states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.977" offset="6592738">Ford and GM pioneered in developing the technology of the air bag.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.791" offset="6616040">And well before the Coleman experiment, GM voluntarily committed to put 100,000 air bag-equipped cars per year on the road in the model year '74 to '76--</text>

            <text syncTime="1665.708" offset="6807674">The rule we're talking about here today has been described as the most important safety regulation on the books.</text>

            <text syncTime="1688.715" offset="6899729">The description came from William Nordhaus, who was a witness in the proceeding below, and I think it was also quoted in the Court of Appeals' decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.524" offset="6934942">Notwithstanding the profound impact on highway safety of the regulation at issue here, at bottom the case itself is very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.721" offset="6987710">It's a conventional case of APA judicial review of informal rulemaking under the traditional standards of Overton Park.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.777" offset="7027938">It turns on the Auto Safety Act, which directs DOT to promulgate standards to protect the motoring public against unreasonable risk of death or injury, and DOT did promulgate such a regulation to require the installation of passive restraints to provide protection against death and injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.708" offset="7115710">Now, in anticipation of this rule two types of passive restraints have been developed and installed, and it's undisputed on this record... there's no uncertainty here... DOT agrees that these two technologies work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.684" offset="7187599">First is an automatic seat belt which has been installed in hundreds of thousands of cars since 1975, and those belts are effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.993" offset="7232843">Now, this is not Buck Rogers space age technology.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.006" offset="7248830">It is very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.710" offset="7255622">You attach the seat belt to the door, you open the door, you slide in, you close the door and the belt's in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.784" offset="7291984">That's all that it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.173" offset="7297522">It has been used in hundreds of thousands of cars and it works.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.171" offset="7317480">Now, NHTSA's own studies reflect that these automatic belts in use have increased usage by over 40 percentage points, and the Solicitor General's reply on pages 14 and 15 underscores the high usage rate of these automatic belts that have been in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.864" offset="7404311">And taking account of any demographic differences... selection, small cars, particular users... taking account of any demographic differences, the agency's own data show that installation of those seat belts would save almost 6,000 lives a year and avoid over 100,000 injuries each year.</text>

            <text syncTime="2865.056" offset="11605009">What the agency has done is put the industry back in the driver's seat as far as the pace of safety, and that is directly contrary to the decision of the Congress that said that this is not going to be the industry's ball game as far as deciding when and how safety progress will be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.733" offset="11711798">This is the responsibility of the agency.</text>

            <text syncTime="2903.010" offset="11756833">I think the Government tried to pick a fight on what were essentially phantom issues in their opening brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.212" offset="11785672">They first said that if this case stands an agency will be frozen in its tracks, uncertainty will never be enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.630" offset="11823393">Well, we have said that an agency that can document or support a finding of uncertainty, of course it can change course.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.359" offset="11862263">Second, they said that there was a formal burden of proof that this case had imposed on the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.276" offset="11901969">We did not read it that way at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.510" offset="11910851">Clearly, the burden of proof... the burden of proof is on a party challenging an agency action, and the court's assertion below that the burden, that the burden, there was a burden of explaining, is not much different again than what this court had said in Atchison, Topeka, that there is a presumption that the first decision of the agency is consistent with the statutory mandate, and if the agency reverses course there is a duty to explain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.573" offset="12055151">We had no difference with the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.996" offset="12068840">There was no burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.589" offset="12079184">The Court of Appeals found, under any standard of judicial... under any standard of rational decisionmaking, the decision below falls.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.303" offset="12118054">Finally, we asserted that the post-enactment legislative history doesn't ratchet up the standard of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.752" offset="12155880">Once again, we did not see that that was how the Court of Appeals was using that legislative history, but if there were any question about that we were not relying upon post-enactment legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.230" offset="12205721">We were relying and do rely on the standards of Overton Park, which we believe, when you march up the hill or down the hill, you have to pass muster under the standards of that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.053" offset="12273013">Parenthetically, we do, in connection with the colloquy with Justice Stevens, it's clear that the cases that speak about failure to act at all are a different genus than the revocation cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.575" offset="12339155">The cases have consistently given agencies more elbow-room in failure to act than in rescission, or revocation cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.900" offset="12388474">Consistently the cases, which we've cited in our brief involving revocation, have held the agency to an arbitrary and capricious standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.222" offset="12433718">Now, let me make a couple more comments if I could in connection with the Solicitor's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.109" offset="12469244">First, as far as the questions of safety, the key fact is that at no point has the agency ever found that non-detachable belts pose any safety problem at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.822" offset="12544164">In fact, all the evidence is just to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.054" offset="12557016">We have spelled this out in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.492" offset="12566838">In 1978 the agency concluded that these non-detachable spool-release belts will not cause serious occupant egress problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.722" offset="12611769">In 1978 GM, that had proposed that particular kind of belt, said that those belts would provide for rapid egress without use of buckle release mechanisms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.263" offset="12653878">And in this very proceeding, the GM safety director said that spool release is viable from a safety egress point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.025" offset="12688882">So there has been no question on this record at all of support for a problem of egress with a non-detachable or spool-release belt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.303" offset="12734022">In terms of the suggestion that the agency continues to be committed to a Coleman plan or the promotion of passive restraints, that as well is totally belied by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.120" offset="12821271">First, there is the suggestion that there be an educational effort to convince people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.523" offset="12846871">Paul Newman will step out of his sports car, look you in the eye, and say, "Buckle up".</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.709" offset="12867664">Well, that program had met with such disfavor in the Congress that they have denied additional funds to an educational program until... that kind of educational program, until the agency can demonstrate that it's effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.766" offset="12935896">Second, they said that they've asked for more money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.045" offset="12949062">The Solicitor General notes that the agency has asked for $7.5 million of funding for a crashworthiness program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.480" offset="12982707">There is no indication what part, if any substantial part, is to go to a passive restraint program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.821" offset="13016144">Third, they've suggested that they're going to have a demonstration program in the Government to put air bags in the cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.255" offset="13049894">Now, today the only manufacturer that is going to produce air bags is Mercedes and they're going to make 5,000 cars, which leads to the interesting possibility of Government employees running their errands in $25,000 and $30,000 Mercedes automobiles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.525" offset="13138920">There is no other U.S. manufacturer that is making any kind of passive... there is no U.S. manufacturer at all that is making any kind of passive restraint today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.505" offset="13186880">Within 24 hours of this decision, as the Court of Appeals had noted, within 24 hours of this agency decision, every manufacturer shut down its passive restraint program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.000" offset="13244872">Today you can't get any kind of passive restraint on any American car and you could only get it as an option on a VW Rabbit, on a VW Jetta, or a Toyota Cressida.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.105" offset="13297222">So the lure that there is something right around the corner in terms of safety and protection for our citizens, as suggested by the Solicitor, simply is belied by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.518" offset="13374858">Indeed, it's rejected.</text>

            <text syncTime="3369.758" offset="13623857">The Government has in its reply brief attempted to cast this difference as a rather squalid disagreement between the automobile industry and the insurance industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.144" offset="13677355">The Solicitor said:</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.423" offset="13682475">"From the broader perspectives of the nation as a whole, the decision is sound and responsible. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.608" offset="13707240">That approach we think is dead wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.575" offset="13719151">But if it were proper to look at this case from the broader perspectives of the nation as a whole, then I ask the Court to lay aside our brief and lay aside Mr. Cutler's brief, and look to the brief of the Epilepsy Foundation of America and the National Society to Prevent Blindness or the brief of the Mothers Against Drunk Driving or the Brief of the American College of Preventative Medicine or the American Academy of Pediatrics, to see where, in the Solicitor's terms, from the broader perspective of the nation as a whole, the responsible action lies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.625" offset="13867318">Mr. Chief Justice, we believe that, for the reasons we have advanced today and in our briefs, the decision of the agency rescinding this important and significant regulation to protect the lives of our citizens, that rescission was arbitrary and capricious and was properly set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.819" offset="13960105">We'd urge that the judgment of the Court of Appeals be affirmed and promptly so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.235" offset="13989780">We thank the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3467.279" offset="14013917">I think if there's anything that ought to be clear after Mr. Fitzpatrick's argument, it is that we are dealing in an area of uncertainty, an area that ought to be left to the particular abilities and expertise of the administrative agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.570" offset="14075148">Indeed, I am now uncertain, not only as to what is the best long-range solution, over which 17 years' worth of Transportation Secretaries have struggled; I am also uncertain even as to what Mr. Fitzpatrick's position is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.332" offset="14138155">I heard on the one hand that the agency whom I represent had found that automatic belts do work, because of the fact that hundreds of thousands... there have been hundreds of thousands of automobiles that had effective passive belts, and that it had increased usage by 40 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.044" offset="14217045">What he neglected to tell you was that the overwhelming majority of those automobiles had their detachable belts guarded by ignition interlocks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.538" offset="14266991">The surprising thing about those data is that the figure was not much higher than 40 percent, because unless the devices have been tampered with you can't even start your automobile unless those seat belts are buckled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.126" offset="14325297">We were then told that what the agency should have done was to rule out a belt that doesn't work, then conceding that in fact this was a belt that didn't work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.495" offset="14374825">But that in fact is exactly what Secretary Lewis did, and that's all he did, was to rule out a belt that didn't work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.164" offset="14409515">The standard that we urge in this case that should be adopted is whether the Secretary could rationally conclude that there was sufficient uncertainty to justify his not going forward with the procedure that wouldn't work.</text>

            <text syncTime="3675.806" offset="14848059">This matter of the defeat rate, the problem of the individual regarding the device that is in his automobile as an enemy and finding some way to defeat it, to cut it out, as obviously happened with these VW belts and as obviously happened with the ignition interlocks, is a very real problem, must be taken into account.</text>
