            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="8.387" offset="170556">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this is a suit arising under the Federal Tort Claims Act, and specifically the issue is whether a suit against the United States alleging that a federal employee negligently inspected a home purchased from a private developer but with federal moneys is a claim arising out of a misrepresentation and therefore barred under the Federal Tort Claims Act, specifically, Section 2680(h) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.387" offset="278494">The Farmers Home Administration is an agency of the Department of Agriculture which, among other services, provides loans to low income rural housing residents to assist them in purchasing safe and decent housing.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.914" offset="336591">In 1977, the Farmers Home Administration granted Respondent's application for a loan, and Respondent then entered into a contract with a private developer... the name of the company is Home Marketing Associates, Inc.... to purchase a prefabricated house.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.458" offset="402837">The purchase price of the house was approximately $21,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.327" offset="418302">During the construction of the house, and in accordance with Farmers Home Administration regulations, a county employee of the Administration inspected the house when it was 2 percent completed, 99 percent completed, and 100 percent completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.504" offset="474935">On each occasion, she signed an inspection report indicating that there were no major deviations from the housing plan and specifications that she discovered in her inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.962" offset="520806">Each inspection lasted between 10 and 30 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.580" offset="535330">Ms. Wells and Respondent both participated in the final inspection, and Respondent signed the final inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.321" offset="578275">Two months after Respondent moved into her house, she notified the Farmers Home Administration that she was having difficulties with the heat pump that had been installed.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="119.743" offset="615892">It really wasn't much of an inspection, was it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="122.045" offset="625191">No, sir, it was not the best inspection that one could have hoped for.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.497" offset="642955">A second inspector went out to the house and discovered that the heat pump that had been installed was not the same heat pump that had been provided in the plans and specifications, that it was indeed a significantly smaller heat pump than they had anticipated, made by a different manufacturer.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.209" offset="709828">In addition, that inspector discovered other defects in the house that are listed in the Respondent's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.314" offset="742220">Efforts by the Farmers Home Administration to convince the Home Marketing Associates company to correct these defects proved unsuccessful for reasons that do not appear in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.939" offset="788718">When Respondent failed to get satisfaction or to receive satisfaction from the company, she filed suit in state court against the Secretary of Agriculture, the head of the Farmers Home Administration, various employees of the Farmers Home Administration, and the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.984" offset="860920">That suit was removed to federal court, and the district court dismissed the... or, excuse me, granted the government's motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.256" offset="898014">The theory of the district court was essentially that the statute and regulations created no basis... created no duty running to the Respondent to guarantee the quality of the house based on the inspections that had been undertaken.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.981" offset="948901">The Sixth Circuit on appeal agreed with the district court with regard to the contract theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.135" offset="973456">It found nothing in the statute, regulations, or conduct of the Farmers Home Administration that would create any kind of a contractual duty to warrant the quality of the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.491" offset="1014938">The court of appeals, however, reversed under the... on the tort issue, and held that the government's inspection could legitimately be regarded or could potentially, at least, be regarded as having violated the good Samaritan doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.583" offset="1067288">The good Samaritan doctrine requires someone who acts on behalf of another and engenders reliance from that other person to exercise due care and to be responsible for any injuries caused by the failure to exercise due care.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.260" offset="1126011">In addition, the court held that the Respondent's claim regarding negligent inspection was not barred by the misrepresentation exception.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="255.580" offset="1159239">Mr. Phillips, you referred two or three times to the claim as one claiming a negligent inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.436" offset="1194661">Actually, the claim involved a breach of the duty to supervise as well as to inspect, didn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="270.875" offset="1220470">Well, the problem with that is that there is nothing specific in the complaint with regard to exactly what they meant by supervision.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.529" offset="1247115">The only supervision of the construction, Justice Rehnquist, was in the inspection of the house.</text>

            <text syncTime="283.183" offset="1269684">Well, but the complaint never went to trial, and under the federal rules you presumably are entitled to adduce any number of facts in support of even a generally pled allegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.407" offset="1318586">The court of appeals certainly referred to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.943" offset="1328721">It says, failure to provide technical assistance, including inspection and supervision of construction.</text>

            <text syncTime="310.150" offset="1377518">--and there is nothing in the statute to that effect, so that at issue... the only thing that could potentially be alleged and be consistent with the statute is the negligent inspection.</text>

            <text syncTime="318.522" offset="1411059">--Well, you say that even the 1949 Act doesn't authorize or require the government to supervise as opposed to inspect.</text>

            <text syncTime="330.996" offset="1460901">I mean, the only supervision that is discussed is supervised loans and the provision of information to the Respondent, so that even to the extent that supervision is alleged here, it is all... it is still all based on the exchange of information, and that exchange of information is what this Court held in Neustadt as barred under the misrepresentation exception.</text>

            <text syncTime="810.198" offset="3377766">As we suggest in our brief, and I don't believe Respondents deny it, there is no new house that I have ever known and that anyone has known and that the contractor even in this case in his testimony had ever seen that doesn't have some problems in it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1381.391" offset="5662540">First, that Farmers Home failed to recommend and approve a reputable and competent builder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.615" offset="5715412">The complaint alleges that the builder was disbarred subsequently, and the depositions had attached a letter which showed that builder had nine other complaints against it, not just Ms. Neal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.606" offset="5763373">Secondly, that the officials failed to obtain accurate and complete plans for Ms. Neal's home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.010" offset="5788973">In the complaint we allege they received a totally different set of plans that what they were supposed to be for Ms. Neal, and that those plans didn't have any plans for the heating and cooling duct system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.135" offset="5829515">Third, that the Farmers Home did not properly review the plans and specifications of Ms. Neal's home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.122" offset="5853443">Ms. Wells admitted she didn't look at the plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.157" offset="5865564">Fourth, that the Farmers Home did not properly supervise the expenditure of Ms. Neal's loan proceeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.346" offset="5898373">There was money paid out before the first inspection was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.298" offset="5914151">Farmers Home failed to detect defects in Ms. Neal's home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.500" offset="5934945">That is quite evident.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.452" offset="5938811">They failed to reject defective working materials or to require their correction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.654" offset="5959604">Finally, they failed to carefully inspect her home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.974" offset="5976845">Out of this extensive negligent conduct, which lasted over a period of months and involved several Farmers Home employees, the government extracts out one single inspection report and seeks to rely upon it to deny Ms. Neal her day in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.721" offset="6055839">An examination of the facts alleged in the claim and gleaned from the record here shows that the graveman of Ms. Neal's complaint is negligence, not misrepresentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.160" offset="6093560">We must review the conduct in relationship in the transaction between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.766" offset="6128042">When we do, that shows that a duty... that Farmers Home undertook activities which they had a duty to perform with due care.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.704" offset="6163777">In 1976, Ms. Neal was a 48-year-old cafeteria worker in a local elementary school.</text>

            <text syncTime="1524.333" offset="6234308">When she couldn't find housing she could afford herself, she went to the lender of last resort, her local Farmers Home Administration office.</text>

            <text syncTime="1538.208" offset="6289792">She was certified eligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.010" offset="6297002">Ms. Neal was referred by the county supervisor to a local builder of prefabricated homes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.698" offset="6331797">They reviewed plans which purported to be for her home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.400" offset="6350605">They supplied a form construction contract which had a special clause in it which gave Farmers Home the right to inspect, test, and examine materials, and to reject defective materials and require correction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.208" offset="6401805">Before construction began, she executed a promissory note to pay back the loan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.814" offset="6428241">She executed a deed of trust to secure the note.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.432" offset="6442661">And then the proceeds were put in a supervised account which required not only her signature but an official from Farmers Home's signature to release the funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.406" offset="6486546">Three dispersements were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.989" offset="6496891">The last one that we know of was made on September 30th, and then they made three on-site inspections, the last one occurring on October 3rd.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.595" offset="6531373">Now, after she moved into the house, she discovered things weren't right.</text>

            <text syncTime="1754.562" offset="7155177">This is not an inspection case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.597" offset="7167402">It is a negligence case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.080" offset="7173253">And in order to establish a claim for negligence, you must determine whether or not there is a duty of care running from the government to the injured party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.988" offset="7212959">That depends upon the relationship of the parties, the conduct and control exercised by the government to prevent the injury, and the foreseeability of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.545" offset="7259144">It is certainly foreseeable in the fact situation you gave that a purchaser of a defective toy would be harmed, and if the government had control over that process, it may very well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.353" offset="7310344">I think the weakness in that case is the first criteria, and that is the relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.507" offset="7335004">In this case, Farmers Home and Ms. Neal had a direct one-to-one relationship which was clearly dependent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1903.990" offset="7752963">If a private party had undertaken to provide Ms. Neal the services which Farmers Home undertook, and engendered the kind of reliance which Farmers Home engendered, that person would be obligated to use due care.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.833" offset="7808342">If that party failed in its duty of care and damages resulted, liability would be found.</text>

            <text syncTime="2083.255" offset="8469972">The crucial thing for the negligence claim is whether or not there was a duty of care, and the duty of care only arises under principles of common law, and in this case the principle of common law applied is the voluntary undertaking doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.733" offset="8531934">If Ms. Neal had been given her opportunity to present her claim before a trier of fact, this Court and the parties could have avoided some of the confusion which has arisen regarding some of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.278" offset="8614063">This confusion in this statement is probably inevitable in light of the fact that there was no trial, finding of fact, or record, complete record produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.836" offset="8652306">We feel it would be inappropriate for this Court to issue an opinion which may have important consequences to tort law and federal housing policy on the basis of an incomplete record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.525" offset="8695043">Secondly, the government's assertion that Ms. Neal's claim is really a misrepresentation is a red herring.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.147" offset="8729524">The facts alleged in the complaint and which are contained in the record cannot support the government's contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.503" offset="8762961">If the Farmers Home interpretation of the misrepresentation exception prevails, the Tort Claims Act itself will be emasculated.</text>

            <text syncTime="2208.538" offset="8971105">You have to look at the relationship of the parties, the conduct of the parties, and the foreseeability in those three areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.525" offset="9003079">You have to look to see whether or not this is in fact misrepresentation or negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.012" offset="9016976">Finally, the government and Congress under the Title V of the 1949 Housing Act created a program to assist low-income residents in the country to obtain decent and safe housing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.926" offset="9100672">This purpose of the Act is being frustrated by the negligent acts of the agency charged with this responsibility.</text>

            <text syncTime="2270.361" offset="9218432">Farmers Home would be able to finance construction of the very unsafe, substandard homes which it is supposed to replace.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.901" offset="9256571">It is important to note that the government has made a contention that the administrative relief under the 509(c) program creates some kind of exclusive remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.727" offset="9319892">First of all, the 509(c) program created the remedy in order to get the program back on track.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.499" offset="9350925">In other words, Congress perceived there were problems primarily because adequate inspections weren't being made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.986" offset="9376943">However, there is nothing in the statute, nothing in the legislative history which suggests that Congress intended to cut off or substitute a remedy in lieu of the one provided under the FTCA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.544" offset="9427098">In essence, Congress didn't contemplate whether or not there was the existence or non-existence of any remedy under the Federal Torts Claim Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.984" offset="9460848">Finally, the fear of vast financial liability is more properly addressed to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.090" offset="9493345">Secondly, there has been no factual support of this vast fear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.778" offset="9524065">Farmers Home can exercise greater care in approving builders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.313" offset="9546217">It can require construction bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.348" offset="9554367">It can conduct more careful inspections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.967" offset="9568786">It can be more rigorous in requiring contractors to correct shoddy construction, and in fact, the claims paid out under the 509 program have declined between 1981 and 1982 from 292 claims to 106.</text>
