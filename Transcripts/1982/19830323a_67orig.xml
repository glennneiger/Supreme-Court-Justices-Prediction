            <text syncTime="14.162" offset="206458">Thanks, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.641" offset="212310">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in this case Idaho seeks apportionment of the fish it contributes to three Columbia Rivers... Columbia River runs of anadromous fish, spring and summer chinook salmon, and steelhead trout.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.820" offset="329025">We have historically contributed about half of the fish to each of the upriver runs of these fish, but have not received a fair share of the harvest.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.567" offset="368000">From 1962 until 1980, the defendants took 83 percent of the harvest.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.972" offset="393704">They took of summer... of spring chinook.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.453" offset="407601">They took 75 percent of the harvest of summer chinook, and 58 percent of the harvest of steelhead.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.327" offset="435082">The Master, however, reached a conclusion which is not supported by the record because he confined Idaho to a straightjacket of proof, a narrow five-year period from 1975 to 1980, the period after the suit was originally filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.109" offset="506240">He disregarded a history of disproportionate sharing of Idaho origin fish, as I have just outlined, the very evidence which we believe this Court wanted in the original decision issued in 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.749" offset="568725">He chose a narrow, unrepresentative time frame of runs depressed by dams and overfishing by the defendants, when there was no significant harvest of fish available.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.628" offset="624313">The only significant harvest was by the defendants in 1977, and it was on the summer... on the spring chinook run.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.003" offset="657750">At that time, even though there were not enough fish to meet the escapement that the defendants had agreed on with the Indians in the five-year plan, the defendants conducted a downstream harvest, and during that year they took 78 percent of the harvest of spring chinook, and that was during the five-year period that the Master actually did consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.749" offset="748761">Idaho did harvest some fish during those years, but they were harvests that were conducted in the hatchery areas on surplus fish that were not needed for spawning requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.558" offset="804036">The Master did not take into account the massive effort that was just getting under way to restore these runs to their former numbers so that they would once again be harvestable.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.097" offset="854191">The facts are that the runs are being restored through existing hatchery efforts in the three states.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.060" offset="886060">They are going to be restored additionally under the Lower Snake compensation plan which contemplates nine new hatcheries.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.257" offset="922841">About three or four of those are presently on line, and others are in the works.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.271" offset="938827">Under the Northwest Electric Power Planning and Conservation Act, a tremendous effort is just getting under way to restore the damage caused by the Lower Columbia Dams, and that is going to have an effect, because it is going to be implemented starting immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.532" offset="1011866">Granting relief to Idaho will not be in vain, because passage mortality losses upstream are such now that renewed runs will get to Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.150" offset="1066409">An allocation formula can be made using existing methodology and formulas that the defendants use each year already in making allocations of fish for the Indians under their five-year plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.181" offset="1126491">It is not going to be that much more difficult to take a share of the non-treaty fishery, the non-treaty harvestable surplus, and set it aside for Idaho, so that we can share in the fish that we contribute to these runs.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.972" offset="1189707">The Indians found that it was necessary for them to get a court decreed allocation of fish, because they are in the same position that we are.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.028" offset="1225861">We are end users.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.139" offset="1234325">In other words, the defendants fish below both us and the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.574" offset="1260029">They can take the fish.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.285" offset="1262955">We have no control over them.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.765" offset="1272881">And it was apparent to the Indians that they needed the protection of a court decree, and we believe that we do, too.</text>

            <text syncTime="294.595" offset="1328156">In the Sorhappy case, the Federal District Court said that the Indians were to get 50 percent of the harvestable surplus.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.792" offset="1372983">Then the parties agreed on a five-year plan, starting in 1977... it just terminated last year... whereby an escapement of 120,000 fish over Bonneville was agreed on.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.650" offset="1424392">The Indians were then to get a certain amount, and it is in the formula in the five-year plan for ceremonial and subsistence fishers.</text>

            <text syncTime="335.671" offset="1492414">Then the fish are shared on a percentage basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.902" offset="1505371">The Indians get 40 percent above the escapement and above the ceremonial fishery.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.506" offset="1527836">The defendants get 60 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.568" offset="1540062">So it is on a percentage basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.709" offset="1548630">And that is fair to all parties, and that is what we are basically after here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1233.670" offset="5084460">In 1978, in his report, Judge Brightenstein said,</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.724" offset="5100656">"The contribution of Idaho to the total system fishery is substantial. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.967" offset="5121658">"Idaho produces many fish and receives few. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.119" offset="5134197">"To a significant extent, Idaho is subsidizing the downstream fishery, both Indian and non-Indian. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.403" offset="5167425">And that was supported, those initial findings were supported by uncontroverted evidence in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.618" offset="5192294">That evidence showed that from 1962 until 1980, Idaho contributed 50 percent to the upriver runs of spring chinook, the defendants harvested 435,622 fish of Idaho origin, constituting 83 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.842" offset="5277139">They left us 17 percent of the harvestable amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.365" offset="5291245">During that same period, we produced 40 percent of the summer chinook.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.109" offset="5314233">They harvested 75 percent of the Idaho origin summer chinook for a total of 58,069.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.054" offset="5349969">We produced or we contributed 48 percent of the steelhead to the upriver run.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.687" offset="5372538">The defendants harvested 58 percent, which amounted to 370,484 fish.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.993" offset="5405766">We believe that the evidence building on that shows that not only were the dams depressed because of... or were the runs depressed because of the dams, and the mortality caused by the dams, but also because of overfishing by the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.318" offset="5491030">With regard to spring chinook, they fished in seven years, 1958, '59, '60, '63, '65, '67, and '74, in which an adequate minimum escapement was not provided for, and one of the highest priorities in fish management is to ensure that you have that minimum escapement so that you can continue the species.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.132" offset="5582249">They took 515,000 fish and about half of those were of Idaho origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.716" offset="5604610">And it should be pointed out that in 1974, just one year before the period that the Master thought was important, they fished against the recommendations of the biologists.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.702" offset="5652571">The biologists said, we aren't going to have a fishable run, a harvestable run, but they fished anyway, and they seriously impacted that run.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.849" offset="5689143">The escapement over Bonneville was almost half what it should have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.354" offset="5715161">It was 68,000 and some odd fish.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.806" offset="5728953">And that had impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.598" offset="5740134">When you overfish in one year, it has impact in the future, because there should have been additional fish available in 1968 which would have been four-year-olds out of the '74 return, and five-year-olds in the 1969 run, yet the 1969 run... or '79 run, which the Master did consider, was a record low.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.015" offset="5837832">So, essentially, if we say there is no relief in sight, we are allowing the defendants to benefit from their management practices, which allowed fishing below a minimum escapement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.362" offset="5883180">The same situation is generally applied with regard to the summer chinook and the steelhead trout.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.335" offset="5911079">We believe that a remedy is appropriate, that it is feasible, and that it is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.071" offset="5938037">Idaho should be allocated a share of the fish that it contributes to these runs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.125" offset="5962279">We are not asking for the defendant's fish.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.518" offset="5971892">We are asking just to share in the fish that we contribute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.297" offset="5986938">As the director of the... or as the Department of Fisheries in Washington indicated in the publication entitled A Plan for Revitalizing The Salmon Fisheries of Washington State, at Page 8... that is exhibit I-25...</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.399" offset="6055379">"As a general rule, we must recognize that a major proportion of salmon must be returned to all areas where they originate for disposition as their owners choose. "</text>

            <label>Mr. Edward B. Mackie</label>
            <text syncTime="1622.435" offset="6639477">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the starting position that the state of Idaho takes is to assert that the Master in some way restricted the record they had an opportunity to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.695" offset="6700604">That assertion is simply false.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.097" offset="6710112">The Master did not restrict the record which the plaintiffs had an opportunity to make in this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.020" offset="6737802">The Master's report and statistics indicates run sizes from 1956 on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.146" offset="6766328">The record has material reflecting runs that are prior to 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.459" offset="6787644">What the Master did was, having heard the testimony on the question of indispensability, which resulted in the report, and then subsequently when the matter was remanded to the Master for proceeding upon the merits, took the testimony, the exhibits, and the arguments, and from that looked at the totality and could see the marked changes that have occurred in the Columbia River and Snake system as a result of the dams and the impact on the fishery, and having that knowledge before him, indicated that if the court was to prescribe a decree to address an allocation as sought by Idaho, one should look at what the realities of life are now, to address that decree, rather than to address a decree on the basis of what may have occurred in the 1940's, fifties, or sixties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.487" offset="7019716">So, the record is in fact full.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.248" offset="7034762">It is not restricted to the most recent period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.700" offset="7044584">On the presentation of argument for the indispensability question, one of the contentions for indispensability was that most of these dams on this system are owned and operated by the federal government or licensees of the federal government, and therefore the United States for that reason was an indispensable party, because its control of the flow of water through those dams and the turbines as contrasted with spill had a direct impact on the availability of fish.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.742" offset="7164747">Idaho's response was that they accept the dams, they accept the loss, and therefore the United States was not indispensable upon that theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.948" offset="7205603">This Court in the opinion remanding it back to the Master acknowledged that position taken by Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.552" offset="7236009">Now, it turns back to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.155" offset="7250429">They are taking the posture that one should in some way apportion the loss that occurs by upstream passage of the fish rather than Idaho being the area where the fishery takes place after the fish have gone through eight dams on its upward matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="2113.077" offset="8602109">That is based historically, when you are dealing with two states both of whom have a right of prior appropriation doctrine, of merging those two systems.</text>

            <text syncTime="2128.888" offset="8665325">But generally those cases have recognized on a historical priority the older established right provided it has not been abandoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.405" offset="8707435">Now, more recently, this Court in the Colorado-New Mexico case issued in December seems to put a more current re-examination of what rights are being exercised that have been historical to determine whether some of those rights may be withdrawn back and transferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.438" offset="8787474">In that case, all of the water had effectively been previously appropriated to New Mexico, and the claim was for water in Colorado.</text>

            <text syncTime="2174.328" offset="8847033">This Court remanded it to the Master to make further findings because it was not satisfied that... of the reasons for the transfer, and the Court had various opinions on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.204" offset="8886635">But it does say that you look more at a current use rather than the historical approach that has been more common in water right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.121" offset="8918295">It is to look at what has been the historical pattern of the use and recognize those historical patterns when they can be made compatible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.265" offset="8950792">But in the water cases, there are two very important things related to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.238" offset="8970749">One, the water cases have traditionally refused to grant a state... a preferred position to the state of origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.393" offset="9003350">This Court reaffirmed that refusal in the Colorado-New Mexico case at Footnote 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.398" offset="9031353">That same approach has been in the Nebraska-Wyoming case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.011" offset="9049848">Idaho's claim here is "a state of origin" it has.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.785" offset="9068865">In water right, that does not give a preferred position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.458" offset="9083598">Second, in water, the state of origin is in fact where the total volume as it exits the state has in fact been formed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.663" offset="9132395">The amount of water as it flows across the border is a certain quantity of water, and then it exits the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.929" offset="9161443">In this situation, Idaho is the place of birth, and those fish which are born there leave Idaho when they weigh between one-tenth of a pound and one-fortieth of a pound when they leave Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.391" offset="9231347">When they return, and Idaho is here asserting basically a claim and a preferred position for harvest, those fish average about 15 pounds, which is a factor of 150 to 600 times the weight of when these fish left, and that growth and that weight gain all occurs outside the state of Idaho.</text>
