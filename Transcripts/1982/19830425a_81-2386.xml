            <text syncTime="11.118" offset="182560">Mr. Zinman, I think you may proceed when you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_zinman" startTime="59.363" stopTime="458.699">
            <label>Mr. William H. Zinman</label>
            <text syncTime="59.363" offset="375553">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.738" offset="385061">The issue in this case is should this Court apply the Maryland arbitral statute of 30 days or the six-month statute of limitations contained in 10(b) of the National Labor Relations Act or a longer statute of limitations to this hybrid action.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.494" offset="460085">If, on the other hand, this Court applies the Maryland arbitral statute to this hybrid action, the next issue would be whether or not it should be applied prospectively or retrospectively in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.147" offset="514733">The facts in this case are as follows: Philip Del Costello, the Petitioner in this case, was employed by Anchor Motor Freight, the Respondent, as an over-the-road truck driver at the time of his termination on June 27, 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.747" offset="581084">At that time he was also a dissident member of PROD, a national Teamsters organization and was engaged in a campaign of truck safety several months proceeding his termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.274" offset="635210">On that date he was assigned to drive a truck from Baltimore to Canada and during the course of his inspections he found a number of safety defects with respect to the truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.938" offset="689858">When the company insisted that he drive the truck he refused, and he was terminated on the spot.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.842" offset="713473">Consistent with the company union contract, he initiated a grievance at that time which was not resolved amicably.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.965" offset="745969">As a result, the grievance took the form of a hearing before a committee consisting of an equal number of employer and union representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.009" offset="786093">I believe this was in July of 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.960" offset="801976">At that time he was represented by his business agent who is his exclusive representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.455" offset="839905">He did not have the right to an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.565" offset="848369">The business agent conducted no investigation into the facts which preceded the termination, nor did the business agent introduce any evidence and particularly it failed to introduce the mechanic who supported Mr. Del Costello's position that the truck was unsafe.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.089" offset="926423">The only evidence that was introduced was through a company supervisor at that time who Mr. Del Costello claimed was not even there.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.960" offset="961950">This was contrary to the conference rules and if that evidence was excluded, of course, the company would not have met its burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.378" offset="999566">Mr. Del Costello related to his business agent that this man was not even there.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.736" offset="1021091">The business agent failed to object.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.592" offset="1028510">As a result of this hearing, the committee upheld the discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.825" offset="1061424">Subsequent to that the business agent engaged in a course of conduct which reasonably led Mr. Del Costello to believe that he had yet to exhaust his contract remedies and that the decision was not final until December of 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.004" offset="1134149">Several months thereafter, I believe it was in March of 1978, Mr. Del Costello initiated suit in the federal district court for the district of Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.156" offset="1178766">Several months thereafter both Respondents answered the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.420" offset="1203739">However, Local 557 never even raised the issue of limitations in its answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.649" offset="1232683">While Anchor Motor Freight did raise the question of limitations it did not specify which limitation period it had mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.537" offset="1264239">This was understandable at that time because the Maryland arbitral statute by its own terms is expressly inapplicable to labor disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.003" offset="1306139">In any event, for the next 32 months during which time the parties engaged in rather extensive discovery, not one time did Anchor Motor Freight or Local 557 ever raise the question of limitations until they filed their motion for summary judgment in November of 1980, one month after this Court granted certiorari in Mitchell.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.661" offset="1420764">We contend that if this Court applies the arbitral limitation statute of 30 days for all intents and purposes the hybrid cause of action is destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.749" offset="1489101">I say that because most of these arbitration statutes were initially passed by the state legislatures to apply to commercial disputes and in commercial disputes from the arbitrator to the courts the parties are usually represented by the same counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.005" offset="1582096">And it is a matter of smoothly shifting gears from the arbitrator to the court in terms of the filing of appeal which in that instance only takes hours to possibly one day.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.279" offset="1643223">The situation is entirely different with a disconnected party such as Mr. Del Costello or anyone having hybrid cause of action because he does not have an attorney at the grievance procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.322" offset="1699439">He is limited, and in this case he was limited exclusively to his representative, his union representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.977" offset="1730054">Moreover, unlike the arbitral proceeding where there is an established and known record of law and fact, the facts surrounding the malpractice not only are not on the record but the business agent in most instances does everything to hide those facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.685" offset="1808839">As a consequence, before the worker ever realizes that he has a cause of action, 30 days has already passed and he is out of court.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.557" offset="1852307">But that is not the end of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.682" offset="1860875">Who does he turn when he first realizes that he has been wronged.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.302" offset="1883341">He has to go to a lawyer and unfortunately those most able to represent him in this field are either labor lawyers representing management or labor lawyers representing unions and due to the polarization of the labor bar he ultimately finds that he has to turn to a general practitioner such as he did in this case--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="458.699" stopTime="463.793">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="458.699" offset="1972888">Mr. Zinman, when you say polarization, do you mean anything more than just conflicts of interest?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_zinman" startTime="463.793" stopTime="786.298">
            <label>Mr. William H. Zinman</label>
            <text syncTime="463.793" offset="1993264">--No, Your Honor, I am simply saying that as a practical matter particularly even in a larger city such as Baltimore lawyers who represent unions and lawyers who represent companies will not take these cases because they view the petitioner as somewhat of a pariah.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.409" offset="2075706">In a broad sense I suggest it might well be a self-perceived conflict of interest or rather technical conflict of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.920" offset="2113741">In any case when a general practitioner gets this kind of client he has to research a brand new law and that takes time.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.353" offset="2171523">After he researches the law and then familiarizes himself not only with that but with the customs and the practices and the contracts and the constitutions and all of the other intricate matters, he then has to decide to conduct a factual investigation to determine frankly whether or not there is a prima facie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.719" offset="2260967">That takes a considerable period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.092" offset="2274446">After all of that is done there is a matter of counsel fees and costs because you must have reasonable cost in this case to meet the well-dealed opponents who have no such problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.942" offset="2353858">So I submit to the Court that this is probably one of the most important reasons why it is totally unfair to apply such a short statute of limitations of even 30, 60 or 90 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.795" offset="2405267">In fact to be perfectly candid, I believe that even six months under these very difficult circumstances is not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.071" offset="2442361">The unions and companies frequently make the argument if any period of time longer than 30 days is applied it will do violence to the policy of rapid disposition of labor disputes which, of course, was the principle enunciated in the Mitchell case several years ago, and I suggest that this is not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.388" offset="2559703">It is not correct for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.213" offset="2566913">First, in Mitchell this Court only had really two options.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.338" offset="2587497">It had the option to select a three or five year statute of limitations on one hand or a 90-day limitation on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.240" offset="2623024">It did not, as I read the case, have the option of applying the six-month arbitral limitation period contained in 10(b) as it does here.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.628" offset="2664611">But more important than that, I really do not believe that there is an empirical evidence to suggest that there is any danger posed to the notion of rapid disposition or more particularly the law of the shop, based upon the fact that if the statistics in the cert petition of the Steelworkers is any indication that there is any avalanche of cases now pending before the district courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.569" offset="2792402">They had 110, but assuming that there is 400 cases now pending before the district courts of the United States, how does that pose as a threat to rapid resolution of labor disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.048" offset="2850289">Moreover, I will just close... Moreover, most of these cases that are pending involve questions of fact as to whether or not the agent properly investigated the case of whether or not he was guilty of committing an act of malice.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.458" offset="2947883">There are very few precedential cases in the whole scope of these cases that are now pending, and given the high degree of proof that is required to prove one of these cases, I doubt very much if there is any particular threat to this policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.640" offset="3016637">So we submit to the Court that the most appropriate statute of limitations would be 10(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="726.792" offset="3045267">In my remaining time I would just submit that the closest analogous limitation period would be 10(b) because 10(b) in breach of duty of fair representation which was contained within the hybrid cause of action was judicially implicated from the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.063" offset="3150384">As such the courts have held on many occasions that a breach of duty of fair representation is also an unfair labor practice as is the conduct of the company in many cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.496" offset="3216108">But to the extent that it is not I refer the Court to the observation of Justice Stewart that it is sufficiently similar in character so as to be encompassed by the National Labor Relations Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="839.324" offset="3495409">It was on motion for summary judgment, and that is the posture of the case at the present time so that all this Court would do obviously is return the case to the district court on remand if it found in our favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.271" offset="3547236">Finally, I would just conclude by stating that we feel also that if the Court does decide that the arbitral limitations is applicable that we suggest that it should be held prospectively rather than retrospectively because there was a reasonable reliance and the best evidence of our reasonable reliance is the conduct of the Respondents in not raising this question of limitations for 32 months.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert M. Weinberg</label>
            <text syncTime="992.714" offset="4108973">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.853" offset="4113466">We challenge the decision below on two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.744" offset="4133110">First we urge that the six-month period in section 10(b) of the National Labor Relations Act be the statute to govern duty of fair representation suits against unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.849" offset="4197476">Second, in the alternative if state law governs we would urge that the 90-day New York statute governing suits to vacate arbitration awards be applied in the case against the union as it was in the case against the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.057" offset="4274276">Let me take our primary position, the 10(b) issue, first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.210" offset="4298936">The starting point, we believe, is that this duty of fair representation cause of action is a federal cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.910" offset="4345747">It is a creature of a federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.518" offset="4356196">It was implied from section 9 of the National Labor Relations Act, the section that confers exclusive bargaining status upon majority unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.545" offset="4400291">The question of what statute of limitations governs a federal statute is a federal question to be determined by construing that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.979" offset="4446057">Generally, where Congress enacts an express cause of action but does not provide a statute of limitations, it is a fair inference that Congress intended that a state limitations period would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.208" offset="4514916">That is so because in the normal case one presumes that Congress intended there be some limitations period and the state law in most cases provides the most likely if not the only source for such a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.010" offset="4582103">But we submit that in that case that inference makes no sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.883" offset="4605613">As both Justice Stevens and Justice Stewart in their respective opinions in Mitchell, the Congress in 1947 when it enacted the NLRA was not aware that this Court would come along later and imply a judicial duty of fair representation cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.095" offset="4694430">In that circumstance, the silence of Congress on the statute of limitations question cannot signify an intent that state law apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.383" offset="4739674">It cannot signify an intent that any particular statute of limitations apply.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="1155.289" offset="4759213">Well, Mr. Weinberg, do you think the silence of the Congress in the many other kinds of federal causes of action where state statutes have been implied was taken to mean that state law was intended by Congress?</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.379" offset="4815638">That was really the only place to turn.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Robert M. Weinberg</label>
            <text syncTime="1170.926" offset="4821803">I think it is both of those.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.502" offset="4836118">Well, what happened is I think you had... In the outset I think the question was what is the statute of limitations and the only place to turn was state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.403" offset="4875719">Over time I think you had that factor combined with the factor that this Court had been consistently saying state statutes of limitations should govern and, therefore, when Congress did not put a statute in there that added weight to that inference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.662" offset="4944787">But you cannot have an inference if Congress was not aware at the time it was creating the cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.394" offset="4967670">That is the circumstance we find ourselves in here, and it seems to us that in that circumstance what you have got to do is you have got to go back to the Act and look at the structure and policy of the Act, the Act that gives rise to the cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.730" offset="5032976">It is our view that when you do that here you get substantial guidance on this question because in section 10(b) of that very Act Congress expressly adopted a limitations period that strikes a balance between the very same complex of employee, employer, and union rights that is involved in the judicial duty of fair representation action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.203" offset="5138929">As this Court found in Machinists, 10(b) reflects Congress' judgment as to the proper balance between the interests of employees and the overriding interest of the Act and industrial peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.731" offset="5200996">In the Court's word the objective of 10(b) was stability of bargaining relationships.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.255" offset="5235164">That very same tension exists in the duty of fair representation context, the tension between individual rights and the functioning of the private system of decision making that the NLRA was intended to foster.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.847" offset="5285528">As this Court recognized in Mitchell, the grievance arbitration process is a critical part of that private decision making system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.982" offset="5334012">Unlike in the commercial context where arbitration is a substitute for litigation, in the labor context arbitration serves as a continuing process by which the law of the shop is developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.335" offset="5403393">The duty of fair representation action is a challenge to a decision arrived at through that process, a decision that the parties to that process, the union and the employer, are perfectly prepared to live by.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.937" offset="5465878">The thrust of duty of fair representation action is that that system of decision making malfunctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.185" offset="5498792">As long as the duty of fair representation suit may be brought, the parties cannot regard the matter as finally settled, and they cannot rely on it in their future dealings with one another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.990" offset="5550096">The Court expressed this point in Mitchell and if I may quote from the Court's opinion,</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.847" offset="5573502">"This system with its heavy emphasis on grievance, arbitration and the law of the shop could easily become unworkable if a decision which is given meaning and content to the terms of an agreement that even effected subsequent modifications of the agreement could certainly be called into question as much as six years later. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.854" offset="5657512">The Court went on to point to the</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.932" offset="5677783">"undesirability of the results of the grievance and arbitral process being suspended in limbo for long periods. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.536" offset="5716235">The six-month period in 10(b) was intended to provide a definitive end to just such situations of uncertainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.905" offset="5773705">It is our view in sum as to the 10(b) issue that the duty of fair representation is an intrical part of the complex of employee, union, and employer rights embodied in the national labor policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1433.285" offset="5871194">We don't think necessarily that 10(b) applies against the union necessarily compels that answer but we do believe that is the correct answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.110" offset="5922498">We do so for the following reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.076" offset="5930439">The reason we say it is a different question is you have got to get at it... You obviously do not have an action arising under the National Labor Relations Act against the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.605" offset="5972549">You have got a 301 action and you have got in 301 a provision where Congress enacted a cause of action and did not expressly enact a statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.440" offset="6035870">However, we believe that the Hoosier Cardinal decision provides ample reason and justification for saying that in the case against the employer as well as the case against the union these consensual processes of private decision making are implicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.105" offset="6126567">The Court in Hoosier seems to have left room for saying that when a 301 cause of action does possibly threaten those processes that some other source in state law might be looked to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.755" offset="6185081">In this case we think 10(b) in that context also.</text>

            <text syncTime="2102.202" offset="8546864">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.935" offset="8557835">Respondents Flower and Jones are before the Court to request affirmance of the judgment below which held that the appropriate statute of limitations was that applicable to non-medical malpractice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.488" offset="8628052">That judgment should be affirmed essentially for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.031" offset="8650204">One, the substance and purpose of the duty of fair representation clearly makes the most analogous state statute of limitations that applicable to legal malpractice, and secondly, that the decisions of this Court and the law that has been established with respect to statutes of limitations would require that the statute of limitation to be applied in a duty of fair representation case against the union be the most analogous state statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.533" offset="8808193">With respect to the substance and purpose of the duty of fair representation from the beginning of its statement in the Steel case throughout every discussion of it, that duty has consisted of a correlative duty which arises from the right of the union to represent all of the employees in the bargaining unit, and the correlative duty is to represent each and all of the employees without discrimination, to represent them fairly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.658" offset="8972764">In the Steel case the analogy was made to a legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.638" offset="8992617">It was held that the right to represent all the employees in the bargaining unit was analogous to the right of the legislature to pass laws which were applicable to all the citizens and that if there were no duty that that right be exercised in a fair way, constitutional questions might even arise so that we are concerned in the duty of fair representation with questions of fair treatment that may rise to the stature of constitutional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.719" offset="9137022">What we have and what the Court has repeatedly held is that the supreme and basic value in a duty of fair representation is protection for the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.620" offset="9196581">It is to ensure that the individual employee will not be the victim of unfair treatment, that the duty of fair representation was not only established in the first place, but has consistently been recognized and enforced by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.691" offset="9268888">It is a representational duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.471" offset="9279964">In speaking of representational duties and in asking what is the appropriate analogy to a representational duty we would suggest that the immediate answer that occurs is that of the relationship between an attorney and a client.</text>

            <text syncTime="2325.234" offset="9438998">Is generally the action against the union worth pursuing even if the statute has run against the employer?</text>

            <text syncTime="2333.216" offset="9470972">The statute for the arbitration would be 90 days in New York, but the answer is yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.616" offset="9504513">Presumably we would be concerned with cases where no action was brought within the 90 days so that we have a situation... As a practical matter, we may have a situation where to enforce the same statute of limitations against the union as has been enforced against the employer would be to deprive that individual employee of any opportunity to gain redress from what he will have to prove has been an arbitrary action by his union and represent him in the arbitration case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2398.876" offset="9733554">In other words, just as in a legal malpractice action, you have two elements of the cause of action.</text>

            <text syncTime="2498.146" offset="10130720">But there had been a violation of the contract, the kind of holding that Your Honors just a few months ago in the Bowen case pointed out that the decision there where the case was not taken to the jury the assessment of damages against the union was predicated upon the proposition that had the union taken the case to arbitration there would have been proof that the employer breached the agreement in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.026" offset="10254227">In that case it was an unfair discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.727" offset="10268960">In this case it is a question of a job assignment and ultimately lay off and termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.256" offset="10291112">So that the very point of the duty of unfair practice responsibility and action is to demonstrate that with proper representation by the union the plaintiff's grievance would have been vindicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.063" offset="10358403">It would have been carried forward successfully.</text>

            <text syncTime="2564.105" offset="10394557">This analogy of having to prove that you would have won had there been proper conduct is not the only point of similarity between the attorney-client relationship and the employee-union relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.627" offset="10472611">The essence of the duty of fair representation is precisely that the individual is in a uniquely vulnerable position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.876" offset="10513571">He is being represented by someone who has a special status under the law, in the attorney case by state law, in the federal case by section 9(a) or by analogous provisions of the Labor Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2961.412" offset="11983742">Section 9(a) is what creates the right in the union to represent all the employees in the bargaining unit, but it does not state what correlative duty flows from that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.513" offset="12056154">That correlative duty is based upon basic notions of justice embedded in the common law as to all kinds of representational relationships.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.555" offset="12112369">It is a principle of justice that goes beyond attorney-client or employee-union, that those who take upon themselves the task of representing others must perform that task with due regard for the rights of others and above all they must not prejudice the rights of others.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.812" offset="12213306">They must realize that they are in a position of greater knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.308" offset="12231383">They must realize that they are in a position of higher responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.824" offset="12249355">They must realize the utter dependence under the circumstances that those they are representing are looking to them for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.694" offset="12296898">They are in a sense helpless in the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.255" offset="12311109">The individuals do not have the knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.643" offset="12324692">They do not have the experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.534" offset="12332216">They do not have the training.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.437" offset="12339843">What is involved here is a special representational relationship and justice as embedded in historic notions of fairness in the law says that the representative must be held accountable and that that duty to be held accountable to the individual is correlative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.040" offset="12418211">It is as extensive as the right to represent all of the employees in the bargaining unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.894" offset="12449662">In Hoosier in the Hoosier Cardinal case the Court was confronted by a statute of limitations problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.032" offset="12498250">Now, the precise issue in the Hoosier Cardinal case was one of a suit by a union to enforce a collective bargaining contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.339" offset="12559481">We submit that the rationale of that case is directly applicable to the issue of 10(b) for the Court said we are urged judicially to invent a statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.094" offset="12654462">But the Court said when the Congress came to establishing an unfair labor practice and creating and defining an administrative procedure for that unfair labor practice it defined a statute of limitations of six months, but when it came to section 301 it did not establish a statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.769" offset="12793225">That contrast this Court explained in Hoosier, that contrast meant that when an action is based upon section 301 the appropriate state statute of limitations should be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.854" offset="12857486">This Court held that it was a matter of congressional intention and that it was demonstrated by the contrast between the lack of statute in 301 and the presence of a definite statute of limitations in the National Labor Relations Act that Congress did not mean for that to be applied in the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.160" offset="12946720">Rather Congress intended that the state statute of limitations should apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.967" offset="12969917">Congress as we point out in our brief put in different titles, different subchapters of the United States Code when it was codified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.902" offset="13017669">The National Labor Relations Act and the section 301 and the six-month statute of limitations had not been applied to section 302 statutes, section 303 claims, nor has it been applied to causes of action which Congress created in further defining the national labor policy of the United States creating causes of action that are very close to in ultimate purpose of protecting the individuals to the duty of fair representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.808" offset="13153296">When it passed the Labor Management Relations Act in 1959 and when in 1970 it passed the Postal Reform Act, it established rights upon which it imposed no statutes of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.395" offset="13215677">This Court has many times pointed out the difference between the public responsibilities of the National Labor Relations Board and the private interest of individual plaintiffs in these duties of fair representation action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.748" offset="13285058">This Court has held that the paramount value in terms of duty of fair representation is protection of the rights of individual employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.945" offset="13333855">A distinction has been drawn between the responsibilities to serve the public purposes and the right of the individual to bring a law suit according to the traditional law to have available to him as Steel said traditional forms of legal redress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.767" offset="13421208">This Court has held that even claims of insubstantial values ought to be protected because it was such a paramount purpose that individuals should be protected from abuse from unfair treatment by their exclusive bargaining representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.961" offset="13513995">Now, in Hoosier you could have said that the cause of action was likewise based upon the National Labor Relations Act because how did the union get the opportunity and get the right to speak for all of the employees and to bring that action to enforce the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.060" offset="13594348">It got it by virtue of its status under section 9(a), the right to represent all employees and sign the contract, and it got the right to bring that action under section 301 which under the decisions of this Court, of course, endowed courts with substantive rights, the right to declare substantive law and is not merely a procedural statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.049" offset="13690270">Likewise here the claim is a claim that is based upon long standing legal principles of individuals not to be unfairly treated by their representatives, and that right not to be represented by the individuals is not a right that is derived from section 9(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.306" offset="13799357">It is a right of substantive law that is part of the 301 grant of power by Congress and part of the rights that ought to be taken into account in determining the appropriate statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.815" offset="13861319">There has been some talk about the party's ability to rely on the decision here, and the rule of the law of the shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.719" offset="13892980">If these parties wanted to rely on the arbitrator's award as much as they imply to this Court that they do, they could obviously have written the substance of the award into their contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.134" offset="13946688">We believe that the judgment below should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.180" offset="13958808">Thank you, Your Honors.</text>

            <text syncTime="3464.144" offset="13994648">I just have two quick points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.755" offset="14001127">First, Hoosier was a straight breach of contract action under section 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.702" offset="14032892">It was not an action derived from the National Labor Relations Act as this one is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.826" offset="14065388">I do not think in the circumstances of this case that it is fair to say that what we are asking for is judicial inventiveness and that what the other side is asking for is something other than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.006" offset="14114080">What we are saying is when you look at this statute and you look at the complex of interest involved, Congress adopted a statute of limitations to apply to that complex of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.252" offset="14171132">It is not judicial inventiveness to say let's apply that statute rather than the statutes of 50 states all of which are different none of which was devised to apply to this set of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.092" offset="14214495">Let me make one point--</text>

            <text syncTime="3554.462" offset="14355974">What we are saying is that looking at the statute and the statute of limitations that was adopted we think that what Congress was trying to achieve there is what it would have tried to achieve here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.563" offset="14428385">The same complex of interest is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.032" offset="14438208">Let me make one point on the state law issue where it is our position that if we get to the issue, the arbitration statute should apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.138" offset="14482616">The Court in Mitchell said the malpractice analogy was inappropriate in that case because the arbitrator's award stood between the plaintiffs and the remedy they sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.724" offset="14544996">That is true as well in the case of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.220" offset="14562968">As counsel for Respondents indicated, they have to prove that there was a breach of contract and the remedy they seek, a remedy under Bowen, is a remedy of back wages which flows from a breach of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.965" offset="14629946">Just as in the case against the employer, it is necessary here if they want to make out their claim to prove that the contract was breached which means you have got to show that the arbitrator's decision was erroneous.</text>
