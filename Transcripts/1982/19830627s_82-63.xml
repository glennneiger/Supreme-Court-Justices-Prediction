            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="8.725" offset="127203">Well, this case comes to us by way of certiorari to the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.488" offset="154161">A police officer of the City of Revere wounded a suspect who was attempting to flee from the scene of a reported crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.733" offset="195225">The police called a private ambulance and the ambulance took him to Massachusetts General Hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.601" offset="222706">When he was eventually released, the hospital sent the city a rather substantial bill for its services.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.072" offset="252590">The city refused to pay and the hospital sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.719" offset="267114">The Massachusetts Court held that the city was responsible for the medical services rendered by the hospital to the wounded suspect and did so primarily on Eighth Amendment grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.857" offset="319673">In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we reverse that holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.595" offset="338585">We conclude that the Massachusetts Court was in error when it premised city's liabilities squarely on the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.221" offset="389159">The relevant constitutional provision is not the Eighth Amendment but instead is the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.255" offset="425312">Eighth Amendment scrutiny is appropriate only after the State has secured a formal adjudication of guilt, and here there been no such adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.267" offset="469302">The Due Process Clause requires the responsible governmental entity to provide medical care to persons who have been injured while being apprehended by the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.527" offset="510367">However, so long as a governmental entity ensures that the medical care is in fact provided, the Constitution does not dictate how the cost of that care should be allocated as between a governmental entity and the provider care.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.754" offset="571284">That instead is a matter of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.785" offset="591346">Mr. Justice Rehnquist has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment and is joined in that opinion by Mr. Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.159" offset="632933">And Justice Stevens has also filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
