            <text syncTime="74.220" offset="435712">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case was begun by a Cuban government instrumentality in February, 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.028" offset="486912">The Cuban government instrumentality, Banco Para El Comercio Exterior de Cuba, which translates to Bank... the Foreign Trade Bank of Cuba, and which for convenience we are going to call Bancec, was suing to recover a sum of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.503" offset="564861">In its answer, the defendant, which I am going to call Citibank, again for the sake of convenience, in its answer, Citibank alleged that the action was brought by and for the Republic of Cuba, Bancec being a mere segment or instrumentality, an indistinguishable and integral part of the Cuban government.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.432" offset="668515">Citibank then asserted as a defensive counterclaim to curtail the sum of money that was sought by Bancec in this case its claim for an amount of money equivalent to the value of its properties in Cuba, its eleven branches that had been confiscated, taken without any compensation by the Cuban government in a manner which the Second Circuit from which this case comes has held was in violation of international law.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.965" offset="810621">The issue framed, the threshold issue framed by the pleadings was therefore in this claim and counterclaim, are the claimant and the counterclaimant opposing parties?</text>
            <text syncTime="186.908" offset="886480">The question here is who is the real claimant, as put in issue by that answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.218" offset="911663">Now, some three weeks after the commencement of this action by Bancec the Cuban government dissolved Bancec and exercised direct dominion over all of Bancec's assets, including the claim in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.992" offset="998807">Thereafter, some several months later, the respondent sought and obtained from the court in which the action was pending leave to substitute the Republic of Cuba as the plaintiff in the action, and that leave was granted, and leave was granted to file a supplemental complaint in which it was alleged that the claim which is the subject of this action was assumed by the Republic of Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.338" offset="1120120">Now, that supplemental complaint was never formally filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.040" offset="1134957">It was just approved for filing by the court at the instance of the respondent.</text>

            <text syncTime="263.894" offset="1194412">Well, this was an application by counsel for a party to substitute another party, another person as the party plaintiff, and the Court in this case on stipulation, on the agreement of the defendant, said it is so ordered.</text>

            <text syncTime="285.916" offset="1282497">This was an application for leave to substitute.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.431" offset="1292528">So that technically it did not effect a substitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.508" offset="1304858">It was leave to substitute.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.257" offset="1315829">They asked for it.</text>

            <text syncTime="394.637" offset="1717383">We argued that there... and the District Court after trial found that at least for purposes of this litigation, there was a commonality among the Cuban government, Banco Nacional, Bancec when Bancec was in existence.</text>

            <text syncTime="439.261" offset="1895852">The language is somewhat obscure and repetitious, and I think it is a mistake, unfortunate that we talk about alter ego or the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.272" offset="1931901">What we are really talking about here is whether, as used to be the case back in the days of the alien property custodian, whether there is a cloaking operation by a corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.205" offset="1979653">The trial judge certainly used the words "alter ego", but his... or one of his overall statements as to his findings was that no matter how regarded, whether this was... the circumstances, the relationship of Bancec during its existence and the Cuban government, taken together with the devolution of the claim, as he put it, upon Bancec's dissolution, made it clear that the claim was now the claim of the Republic of Cuba or of Banco Nacional which had been held to be the alter ego of the Republic of Cuba, that it was in effect... the Republic of Cuba was the party opposed in interest, the protagonist of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.749" offset="2173795">And that is what really we were looking for down there, was what the court was looking for: who is pushing this case?</text>

            <text syncTime="523.134" offset="2231369">I have used the word "protagonist" because I am trying to avoid these mystique words or phrases of art, such as "real party in interest" and "alter ego".</text>
            <text syncTime="535.284" offset="2279956">I think the question is, who is the person who is pushing this claim, and the best word I find for that in the dictionary is the protagonist.</text>

            <text syncTime="1008.625" offset="4173312">Neither under international law nor under federal law... Under both international and federal law, the consequence of that fact is that Citibank is entitled to curtail the recovery that is sought in this case, and that right of curtailment, the right to assert that defense effectively, should not be defeated in this case because the order to take over Citibank's branches, which is the basis for their counterclaim, because that order was signed by Che Guevera as president of Bancec instead of Che Guevera as president of Banco Nacional.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard G. Wilkins</label>
            <text syncTime="1105.881" offset="4562327">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the United States believes that the issue presented by this case is whether or not an instrumentality of a foreign state could bring suit in United States court should be insulated from a counterclaim properly asserted against the state on the sole basis that that state instrumentality did not play a key role in the wrongful conduct of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.730" offset="4669743">The Court of Appeals has answered this question in the affirmative, and by so doing, has rendered irrelevant a broad range of legal and equitable factors that United States courts and foreign courts have traditionally analyzed in attributing responsibility between and among nominally separate corporate entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.332" offset="4748110">The United States has a significant interest in addressing or suggesting that this is an erroneous approach, because by limiting the alter ego question to a single narrow factor, that is, whether or not the state entity played a key role in wrongful conduct, the court below has unnecessarily and unduly restricted the ability of American defendants to raise valid counterclaims in suits brought against them by foreign governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.883" offset="4858347">Respondent in this court would go even further than the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.429" offset="4872557">He argues, or it argues that international law requires this Court to apply Cuban law, not only to establish its separate identity, but also its absolute non-liability for the acts of the Cuban state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.017" offset="4922921">The Court of Appeals, of course, didn't even go this far when it recognized that Bancec's separate status under Cuban law could and would be disregarded if Bancec did indeed play a key role in the wrongful conduct of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.214" offset="4975689">International law, moreover, although it is exhaustively examined by respondent, does no more than establish a presumption, which we recognize, that United States and other foreign courts will generally recognize the independent status of Bancec.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.380" offset="5036293">That presumption, however, is not conclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.958" offset="5046637">United State courts and foreign courts have never held that foreign law is conclusive on the alter ego question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.064" offset="5079029">We cite many cases in our brief where that inquiry is undertaken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.859" offset="5094285">Lord Denning of the British Court of Appeals in the Trentex Trading Corporation case stated that whether a state-owned entity should be considered the alter ego of its parent should not depend on foreign law alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.823" offset="5142141">Rather, he stated, he would</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.558" offset="5149037">"look to all the evidence to see whether the organization was under government control and exercising governmental functions. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.601" offset="5181220">The error of the court below is that it pretermits this sort of inquiry that courts throughout the world have found necessary to resolve this alter ego question.</text>

            <text syncTime="2022.496" offset="8228769">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I would like to begin by addressing Mr. Justice White's question about the source of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.370" offset="8264296">In the first instance, we believe it is international law, and there is a substantial body of law, of international law precisely upon the question before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.254" offset="8307868">All countries, or almost all countries conduct much of their trade through government corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.080" offset="8339111">The third world countries, 100 or so of them, have staked much of their aspirations and economies on these corporations, and the socialist countries conduct all of their trade through these enterprises.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.966" offset="8386654">The distinction to be drawn between this respondent and all these other enterprises does not withstand analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.615" offset="8445272">That is an analysis indeed that is not even undertaken by the petitioner and the government in their briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.441" offset="8472544">When one looks at those institutions, one sees exactly the same things as said here about the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.110" offset="8507235">There is the fact that all of their capital is provided by the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.811" offset="8530014">There is the fact that all of their profits go to the state's treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.559" offset="8541089">There is the fact that their boards are dominated by ministers or the representatives of ministers.</text>

            <text syncTime="2105.682" offset="8561569">Are you speaking now of this corporation, or are you generalizing?</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael Krinsky</label>
            <text syncTime="2108.618" offset="8573272">This is the points in common between this corporation and most of the government corporations of the world, particularly the third world.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.319" offset="8604097">They perform governmental... they pursue governmental purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.941" offset="8626562">They implement governmental policies, just as the respondent did here, but through their commercial acts, just as the respondent did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.530" offset="8668880">And it is this last factor which is stressed perhaps most strongly by the government and petitioner in their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.527" offset="8704929">But the focus of the inquiry is misplaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.244" offset="8715796">Congress in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act came to the conclusion, as every other country has, that all these government corporations pursue governmental purposes, and for that reason it held that the proper inquiry between commercial and governmental is the nature of the act involved, not its purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.266" offset="8811823">And this indeed is a rule of international law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.874" offset="8822272">The Federal Constitutional Court of Germany in the Empire of Iran case, the English courts in the Primaro Congresso case, and this court in Dunhill have said precisely that about the entire law of state training.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.461" offset="8892698">One must look to the nature of the act rather than its purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.179" offset="8911506">There is no reason to identify respondent on that basis more closely with its government than there is to identify any of these hundreds of other corporations of the world with their government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.812" offset="8970020">The English cases have indeed decided issues quite close to that presented here, and they have held that government corporations, including Cuban government corporations, including the successor to this respondent, is not to be identified with the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.163" offset="9055493">It is not responsible for the acts of the state, nor is the state for its acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.973" offset="9078689">And the basis upon which it reached that conclusion was one of international law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.456" offset="9100632">In Trendex, Lord Denning and other members of the court, and in all of the cases, said, the question of whether or not an enterprise is to be identified with the state for purposes of sovereign immunity, and then later in the Primero Congresso case, for purposes of separate liability, is itself a question of international law, and the definition and the line given by the House of Lords in Primero Congresso, the Cuban case, was whether this is a familiar institution in the international scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.971" offset="9246709">Is this a familiar corporation, established by governments throughout the world?</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.736" offset="9265726">And the answer in that case was yes, and the answer in this case, upon analysis and comparison, must also be yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.279" offset="9299894">I think, to answer Justice O'Connor's question, the impact of a ruling disregarding the separate status of this enterprise indeed would be broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.494" offset="9344825">It could not be broader, because it is not different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.071" offset="9367081">It is not different in its functions, and it is not different in its relationship to its government.</text>

            <text syncTime="2348.085" offset="9531130">This question, it has been thought, was settled a long time ago in international law by that extensive network of bilateral treaties between the socialist countries and the capitalist world dating back to the 1920's, by which it was... by which two things were recognized: one, that sovereign immunity is inappropriate for commercial activity; and two, part and parcel of that accommodation that the limited liability of government corporations would be recognized, and that is the basis of international law of state trading, both in respect to sovereign immunity and in respect to limited liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="2535.571" offset="10281054">But even if the statute is not clear enough, and even if the international practice is not clear enough by their own force to provide a rule of law, we believe nonetheless they represent clear and consistent expressions of policy by Congress and by the international community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.014" offset="10390872">And we think, given their source, they should prevail in the formation of any rule of common... rule of federal common law here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.493" offset="10432773">If there is disagreement about those policies, if they are not clear, then we think petitioner and the executive should go to Congress, because Congress is the branch of government which resolves such policy matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.518" offset="10496825">And that is... we think that's the teaching of the Court's decisions on federal common law generally, and we think as well that that teaching is underlined strongly by the prior Cuban cases in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.794" offset="10553981">Whatever controversy there might have been over the role of the courts there, there was, I suggest, broad agreement that the role in this area is more modest and more limited than normal, and that the Court acting as a national court, as it must, is on firmer ground when it seeks to apply international law than when it is asked to frame a rule of law on its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.093" offset="10679160">And that is precisely what respondent... or what petitioner and the United States have asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.280" offset="10699953">It is, moreover, we suggest, difficult to understand the basis upon which the Court itself could come to a conclusion of what proper policy is here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2692.070" offset="10907052">Mr. Krinsky, do we look at the case as of the time the complaint was filed, or as of today?</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.363" offset="10944250">There has been about a 20-year lapse of time, and there is material in the record that suggests very strongly that the ownership of the claim now is in the government itself, or much more closely so than in Bancec.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael Krinsky</label>
            <text syncTime="2712.812" offset="10990017">Your Honor, let me address the question of where the ownership is now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.936" offset="11006526">Our position is that the ownership is in a state trading corporation by the name of Cubazucar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.184" offset="11031499">It is the same corporation which was involved in the Primero Congresso case in the House of Lords, and which was held to be a separate entity, not responsible for the acts of the Cuban government in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.022" offset="11078938">We assert, and our position has always been in the District Court, that the claim went from Bancec to the state entesis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.516" offset="11128884">We made a motion to substitute this state impressor as the successor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.030" offset="11154902">It was denied by the District Court because it did not want to introduce into the case, which it considered a complicated case, new issues, and the new issue that was excluded was precisely what happened upon the dissolution of Bancec.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.819" offset="11230030">And that is how the case was tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.193" offset="11243614">It was tried by the plaintiff that way and it was tried by the defendant that way, and indeed, when one looks at the post-trial requests for findings of fact and conclusions of law by the respondent... I'm sorry, by the petitioner, there is no request for a finding as to the identity of who held the claim after Bancec.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.528" offset="11328877">And it is for that reason that we did not introduce expert testimony on what is a question of foreign law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.931" offset="11354477">And indeed, if that issue is still in the case, despite it having been excluded in this way, we believe that we should be entitled to an opportunity of introducing that expert testimony on foreign law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.158" offset="11423440">Now, on the merits of the claim, we have always taken the position that upon Bancec's dissolution, the claim went to the succeeding state enterprise, and if one reads Law Number 934, which is the critical law here, it says Bancec is dissolved and its assets are transferred to the new state enterprises.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.211" offset="11519676">It is in the present tense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.757" offset="11529811">We think there was no foundation, no foundation in the record for this position, and indeed, it is not procedurally proper, properly in the case any longer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.596" offset="11585191">There is another aspect of the situation, however, in which the case properly should be looked at, I think, from the vantage point of the present day, and that is the impact of the freeze regulations and what Congress has done on the question of separate entity, the question of nationalizations in general and Cuba, Cuban nationalizations in particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.006" offset="11698876">It is difficult to conceive of what issue of policy or equity relevant to this case has not been addressed by Congress and answered by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.032" offset="11742970">Congress had ratified the freeze of all property in the United States of Cuba, of Cuban government corporations, and of Cuban nationals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.558" offset="11796992">Any recovery by this respondent will become frozen, and that can hardly give foreign countries any encouragement in the belief that they can nationalize the United States' own property without consequence for the property of their government corporations in the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="2933.846" offset="11874209">Mr. Krinsky, what then is the motive of your client to continue to litigate this issue if you are not going to get anything out of it anyway?</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael Krinsky</label>
            <text syncTime="2939.844" offset="11898138">Your Honor, we have been instructed by our client to litigate the issue, and we have not been told the reason why.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.780" offset="11921961">The Congress has said something else here of great importance, and that is on the question of equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.338" offset="11960205">It established a program of certifying nationalization claims, not just Citibank's claims, all nationalization claims, and the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission has met for many years and has certified claims of individuals, of corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.144" offset="12027392">And the reason why Congress did that was to provide an equitable basis for the distribution of all frozen funds in the United States in the event of a settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.889" offset="12082353">The result here of a judgment in favor of petitioner would be contrary to that policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.649" offset="12133449">Equity in this case, according to the Congress, is that the funds be available for distribution to all the claimants, not that Citibank obtains a preference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.771" offset="12177857">And it is, again, we suggest, the interest of the United States and the equitable notions of the United States as established by Congress which should govern this controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.655" offset="12229475">There is, Your Honor, a notion in these cases of looking to the overall interests of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.024" offset="12294885">There is, however, counterposed to this who is to define those interests and what are the sources of law to govern.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.630" offset="12337308">We have argued, we believe, that international law provides that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.612" offset="12361236">There is no distinction between this respondent and other government corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.828" offset="12382134">The rule of law which allows each case, each government corporation to be evaluated according to the local law of the forum will leave nothing, nothing of the international law of state trading and government corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.679" offset="12465517">All that would be left is all government corporations in doubt, and every country invited to apply its own notions of what is a proper government corporation, and indeed precisely as Congress feared, each country will be invited to apply its local notions of what is a proper private corporation and what is the proper relationship between a parent corporation, a United States parent corporation and its subsidiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.025" offset="12590905">We think that is a result which has no basis in law, and to the extent that policy concerning it is to be changed, it should be done by Congress or by the executive in the international area advocating a different position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.692" offset="12657569">I believe, Your Honor, that is all I have to say.</text>

            <text syncTime="3159.585" offset="12777106">As far as the generalities are concerned, which Mr. Krinsky has discussed, I think he is wrong on them, but I think where he is mainly wrong is in his election to speak for what the policy of the United States and what the interest of the United States ought to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.891" offset="12838337">I have really nothing to add unless the Court has further questions.</text>
