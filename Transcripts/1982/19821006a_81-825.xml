            <label>Mr. Francis J. McConnell</label>
            <text syncTime="62.302" offset="399645">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, this case involves the scope of protection under the immunity statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.605" offset="468817">As Your Honors well know, that statute provides that no use or derivative use may be made of compelled testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.540" offset="528586">The issue presented by the petition is whether Mr. Conboy's deposition testimony, which repeats verbatim or closely tracks his immunized grand jury testimony, can be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.104" offset="642793">This case arises out of the corrugated antitrust litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.740" offset="681350">In 1978, indictments were brought against a number of major paper companies, alleging a price-fixing conspiracy in violation of the anti-trust laws in the corrugated container industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.767" offset="741431">Mr. Conboy is a former employee of the Weyerhaeuser Company, one of the defendants in that action, and the petitioners in this case are purchasers of corrugated containers who opted out of the class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.336" offset="847697">Now following the indictments in 1978 there were a series of class and civil actions filed in various district courts throughout the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.440" offset="888135">Those actions were consolidated in the Southern District of Texas before Judge Singleton.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.715" offset="925229">In the course of discovery in the class litigation the District Judge, on motion and the necessary showing of compelling and particularized need, released certain grand jury transcripts, including that of Mr. Conboy.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.330" offset="1031704">Later, in May of 1981, Petitioners, pursuant to subpoena, in Chicago took the deposition or attempted to take the deposition of Mr. Conboy.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.634" offset="1112893">We had his grand jury transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.057" offset="1130656">Mr. Conboy had a copy of the transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.243" offset="1143404">His lawyer had a copy of the transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.458" offset="1152181">And the examination took the following format.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.100" offset="1166809">He had testified before the grand Jury under immunity that he had exchanged prices with Dick Herman of Alton Boxboard.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.937" offset="1202127">The first questions: Mr. Conboy, with whom it Alton Boxboard did you exchange prices?</text>
            <text syncTime="270.840" offset="1233787">He evoked the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.215" offset="1243296">Next question: Is it not a fact that you exchanged prices with Dick Herman of Alton Boxboard?</text>
            <text syncTime="282.648" offset="1281017">Again, the witness invoked the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.616" offset="1292824">Third question: Did you not so testify in January of 1978?</text>

          <turn speaker="michael_w_coffield" startTime="1868.967" stopTime="2239.054">
            <label>Mr. Michael W. Coffield</label>
            <text syncTime="1868.967" offset="7626264">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, although I am here today on behalf of John Conboy, in fact I think, Your Honors, that really Mr. Conboy is a representative almost in a class sense of many, many deponents and witnesses before not only this antitrust grand jury that started back in 1976 and resulted in one criminal case, one civil class action case, and this opt-out case, but he is representative of witnesses throughout the country in multi-defendant and large investigate cases, and I have represented many of them and, as Mr. McConnell has himself, these depositions have taken all sizes, all forms and all shapes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.510" offset="7816435">The panel majority, it seems to me, says, as it does precisely at the conclusion of its opinion, the thing that Mr. McConnell throughout his briefs and his argument I would, with all due respect submit, has never answered, and that is the Court says there are just too many uncertainties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.879" offset="7893862">If Kastigar reads the use immunity statute and supports it as a constitutional statute, and as we have applied Kastigar and defense counsel for all these witnesses who are individual counsel for these witnesses, represent to them that what Kastigar means, as this Court has said, is that yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.526" offset="7996471">While we think that the Fifth Amendment and the use immunity must be of the same scope and we should read it broadly, the fact is that it is use immunity and it is not transactional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.925" offset="8050075">And, therefore, the source, if it is a separate source, if it is an independent source, may well be the source of new information, testimony that would be incriminating.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.094" offset="8102737">And if you look at it on the scope, at one end of the spectrum you have Mr. Conboy's concern that if one has to wait to the application of an exclusionary rule down the line, as this Court has frequently said, that is not the same as the Fifth Amendment to simply apply an exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.489" offset="8200331">If one has to look down the line to the judgment of the discretion of a prosecutor... will he or will he not, in the State of Ohio, for example, decide because of an unlimited statute of limitations he is going to have his own antitrust investigation, his own possible indictment of Mr. Conboy and others, because Mr. Conboy did business down there, or will some judge that's not any longer Judge Singleton but some other District Judge, in reading the spectrum of questions that go beyond the actual immunized testimony, say I will cut it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.223" offset="8355289">I think at this point he may have waived or at this point it may be beyond the derivative use concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.812" offset="8393637">So that our submission really is very clear and very simple, and that is that for Mr. Conboy to be certain of the scope of his Fifth Amendment rights and for a reaffirmation of Kastigar, which we think the panel majority clearly did, and that in conjunction with the way the government does this every time, that each testimonial situation... be it civil or criminal, be it interview, grand jury, criminal trial, civil deposition or civil trial or next grand jury... Mr. Conboy and all of those witnesses that he represents are entitled to claim their Fifth Amendment right because the source not of the questions, as we point out in our brief and the panel majority indicated, not of the questions... the source is not the questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.105" offset="8598855">The source is the answers and, therefore, for certainty and in the ability of the witness to know the scope of his Fifth Amendment and to keep the scope of the Fifth Amendment and the statute the same, as the Court has indicated it must be, each time he testifies, he is entitled to claim it because each testimonial situation might be a new use.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.436" offset="8712122">Now you take the one end of the spectrum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.012" offset="8726437">What Mr. McConnell wants to do is to say I bring out the transcript and I give it to you, Mr. Conboy... as he did on the day of his deposition... and this is now the grand jury transcript and I have got it and you have got it, and now I am going to read to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.338" offset="8775756">Did you say this; did you say that?</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.303" offset="8783593">And to make that one relatively simple, he could say in one question if I were to read you all of the questions and all of the answers in your grand jury transcript, would your answers today be the same to those questions, and Mr. Conboy could theoretically say yes, Mr. McConnell, despite the fact that Judge Singleton in this new pretrial order 69 has said I am not going to allow in grand jury transcript to be read into this trial except for cross examination of actual witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.073" offset="8910653">But all of a sudden Mr. McConnell is going to have us transfer what is impermissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence and Judge Singleton has already said I'm not going to let that in, by Mr. Conboy answering the question yes, it all of a sudden becomes now more verifiable, somehow a better class of testimony, and he is going to let it in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.407" offset="8996021">Now the tough question for me at that point is, and Justice Marshall suggested this, can anyone seriously claim that Mr. Conboy's one answer "yes" might somehow be... subject him to criminal prosecution later on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.167" offset="9063103">And I would submit to Your Honors that given the fact that criminal prosecution is still possible and there's been no real argument in this case that it is still theoretically possible--</text>

            <text syncTime="2926.396" offset="11856011">But I think that would be a ludicrous result, because in the cases like Kuehn, in the cases like Brown, the lower... the Court of Appeals who have looked at it clearly have indicated that a new source, a new statement, is a new entitlement to claiming the privilege, because that otherwise might be used and the use would then subject him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.603" offset="11956844">So that in fact what would happen is that Mr. Conboy would continue to claim his Fifth Amendment right, and the mere fact that he happened to have the transcript in front of him, or Mr. Conboy happened to have the transcript in front of him, shouldn't make a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.693" offset="12021209">And we submit that because it is current recollection, because it is in fact within the very statements made by Kastigar, it's the effort to say that the scope of the immunity is the same as the scope of the Fifth Amendment privilege and that in any circumstance in which there might be an extension of that the use is not use by civil attorneys, it is the use by the prosecuting attorneys of the information gained from the immunized testimony.</text>

            <text syncTime="3081.456" offset="12476158">And I think the courts have in fact been fairly careful about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.424" offset="12488070">The whole question of whether or not there is an effect on Mr. Conboy, Your Honors will recall Mr. Conboy was joining an appeal made to this Court for certiorari that was denied because we did take the position that had our transcript not been turned over we wouldn't even be here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3109.869" offset="12589843">But certainly this goes to your question, Mr. Chief Justice, that the fact of the turning over of these transcripts... Mr. McConnell says he doesn't make much use of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.253" offset="12631430">I would submit that there's a great deal of use of them made other than the need, as he claims, to get them in somehow into the courtroom in the trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="3183.636" offset="12884922">And I would submit that that whole series of questions leaves Mr. Conboy, who is the one that started out here with this constitutional right, in tremendous uncertainty.</text>
