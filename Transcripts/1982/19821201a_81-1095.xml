            <label>Mr. Dane R. Gillette</label>
            <text syncTime="78.843" offset="467766">--The date of the criminal act was July the 7th, 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.639" offset="478947">This case is before the Court on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.730" offset="507263">That court reversed Respondent Joseph Slappy's 1976 California state convictions for rape, forcible oral copulation, robbery, burglary, and false imprisonment, because it concluded that his Sixth Amendment right to counsel had been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.004" offset="568390">We submit that the result is an unwarranted expansion of the Sixth Amendment based in part upon a misreading of the state trial record.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.377" offset="601827">In addition, we submit that the Ninth Circuit has unfairly criticized the state trial judge for failing to conduct an inquiry that was not reasonably required by the record before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.951" offset="644145">The facts of the crime can be quickly summarized.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.184" offset="657102">Mr. Slappy first accosted the victim early on the morning of July 7th, 1976, in a liquor store in San Francisco.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.072" offset="688658">After being ordered to leave the store, Slappy went to the apartment building where the victim lived, and there he waited in the lobby until she returned home.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.600" offset="726796">When she entered the building, Slappy grabbed her, forced her into the basement, and there stole her jewelry and committed the sex offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.626" offset="758875">After the victim managed to escape from Slappy, she almost immediately found a police officer and gave him a description of her assailant.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.984" offset="788341">Mr. Slappy was arrested two blocks from the apartment building and approximately 15 minutes later.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.543" offset="814568">He was wearing a distinctive Afro wig such as the victim had described, and was wearing a distinctive green jacket such as the victim had described.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.758" offset="847378">In his pockets--</text>

            <text syncTime="175.459" offset="854169">Is there any challenge here to the verdict as such?</text>

            <label>Mr. Dane R. Gillette</label>
            <text syncTime="179.755" offset="871410">--None, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.443" offset="874127">There has never been a challenge either in the California courts or in the federal courts on habeas corpus that the evidence was insufficient to support these convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.174" offset="909027">This is not a case where we are talking about the scales of justice being poised between guilt or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.281" offset="933477">Mr. Slappy is clearly guilty, and the only real issue is whether he received a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.560" offset="954584">Now, the more critical facts which pertain to the issues before this Court are those which relate to his relationship with the attorney who represented him at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.775" offset="995440">At his initial arraignment in municipal court, the San Francisco Public Defender's Office was appointed to represent Mr. Slappy.</text>

            <text syncTime="219.677" offset="1031071">That arraignment... I don't know the precise date, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.988" offset="1044341">It would have been within a day or two of July the 7th.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="226.252" offset="1057402">Well, it seems to me that the papers before us don't have anything about the date of the arraignment, the preliminary hearing, the date of Mr. Goldfine's hospitalization, all of which, it seems to me, are somewhat pertinent.</text>

            <text syncTime="235.921" offset="1096063">Well, the facts relating to the crime and the time and that such were not initially before the Court because they had never been presented to the lower federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.338" offset="1141725">However, the complete transcripts of both this... well, of the two trials, because there was a mistrial as to two of the counts, have been submitted to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.256" offset="1173386">They were lodged last week per your request.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.302" offset="1185611">As to some of those other points, for example, Mr. Goldfine's hospitalization, the reason that is not in the record is a point that I will get to in just a moment, if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.111" offset="1220824">Now, after the San Francisco Public Defender was appointed to represent Mr. Slappy, he assigned Harvey Goldfine to represent him, and Mr. Goldfine conducted the preliminary examination, and he also conducted what was later described as a voluminous investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.666" offset="1291041">Mr. Goldfine was scheduled to try the case, and that was scheduled to begin on September the 23rd, 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.820" offset="1323642">On September 17th, six days before trial, the Friday before trial, the case was reassigned from Mr. Goldfine to Bruce Hotchkiss, an equally experienced senior trial deputy with the San Francisco Public Defender.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.767" offset="1379440">The reason for the reassignment was that Mr. Goldfine had been hospitalized with appendicitis.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.686" offset="1403159">Mr. Hotchkiss met briefly that day, on Friday, with Mr. Slappy and advised him of the reassignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.043" offset="1432520">He met again with him briefly on Monday morning in court, and then on Tuesday spent in excess of three hours with him discussing the case, met with him again Wednesday morning, again Wednesday afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.367" offset="1477869">On Thursday, September 23rd, in the morning, a jury was selected and empaneled.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.629" offset="1502842">That afternoon, Mr. Slappy, out of the presence of the jury, complained to the judge that in his opinion Mr. Hotchkiss had not had an adequate opportunity to prepare.</text>

            <text syncTime="423.312" offset="1845569">He was fully familiar with the record, including that complete investigation conducted by Mr. Goldfine, and that in his opinion a continuance to allow him to prepare further was not necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.325" offset="1885693">That is how the trial judge characterized it, and that is how he responded to it, as a motion for continuance until Mr. Hotchkiss could prepare.</text>

            <text syncTime="628.277" offset="2665500">Now, at this time, Mr. Slappy did make reference to Goldfine.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.806" offset="2687547">He does refer to him as P.D. Goldfine&gt; ["] in the course of his conversations, and says, he was my attorney and he still is, but he says that in the context of, and I haven't seen him for five weeks.</text>

            <text syncTime="648.285" offset="2745539">He did not ask that Goldfine represent him, and he did not identify Goldfine as his attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.971" offset="2768214">In fact, he said that he had nothing against Mr. Hotchkiss, and specifically said that he did not think Hotchkiss was a bad P.D.--</text>
            <text syncTime="661.404" offset="2797993">On the third day of trial, which was a Tuesday, September the 27th, Mr. Slappy flatly refused to cooperate any further with Mr. Hotchkiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.853" offset="2835818">He was now declaring that his attorney was Mr. Goldfine, that his only attorney was Mr. Goldfine, and that he would have nothing to do with Hotchkiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.147" offset="2868942">He asked on several occasions to leave the courtroom, but did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.816" offset="2895587">He stayed in court, and occasionally disrupted the proceeding with outbursts and questions and statements, much as he had done the previous Friday.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.393" offset="2921918">In this trial, he was convicted of robbery, burglary, and false imprisonment, but the jury deadlocked on the sex offenses, and a retrial was scheduled, which began about two weeks later, on October the 6th, 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.308" offset="2977611">This was in front of a different San Francisco superior court judge, but Mr. Hotchkiss continued to represent Mr. Slappy.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.633" offset="3006868">During this proceeding, Mr. Slappy was described by the second trial judge as deliberately disruptive.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.396" offset="3033931">The judge noted that he occasionally slept through the proceedings, and that in his opinion, the trial judge's opinion, Mr. Slappy was simply trying to create a record.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.220" offset="3069249">Characteristic of his behavior was an event which occurred as the jury was being taken out by the bailiff to begin their deliberations.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.826" offset="3103626">Mr. Slappy suddenly stood up and said in front of the jury, "I want to testify".</text>
            <text syncTime="742.591" offset="3122747">Now, he had been asked prior to that by his attorney to testify, and he had said,</text>

            <text syncTime="748.525" offset="3146467">and had flatly refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.680" offset="3151064">Now, however, as the jury is getting ready to begin deliberations, he decided he wants to testify, not unlike a tactic or a ploy he had pulled in the first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.287" offset="3189516">There, the jury had returned to have certain testimony reread.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.129" offset="3204876">As they were being led out to continue their deliberations, Mr. Slappy suddenly jumped up and said to this jury,</text>
            <text syncTime="769.345" offset="3229745">"There are two sides to every story, and you haven't heard mine. "</text>
            <text syncTime="772.984" offset="3244269">He had also refused to testify in the first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.156" offset="3252942">In the second trial, Mr. Slappy was convicted of rape and forcible oral copulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.841" offset="3275720">All five of these convictions were affirmed by the California court of appeal in January, 1978, and the state supreme court denied hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.259" offset="3313441">In December, 1978, the federal district court judge in the Northern District of California denied Slappy's petition for a writ of habeas corpus, finding that in his opinion the complaints which were made by Slappy with respect to his attorneys, to his attorney, had been properly handled by the state trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.345" offset="3389719">The Ninth Circuit disagreed, and in June of 1981, in an opinion filed by a three-judge panel of that court, concluded that an essential element of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is the right to a meaningful attorney-client relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.197" offset="3457115">It concluded that the failure of the state trial judge to inquire into how long Mr. Goldfine might be unavailable violated that right, and it equated this failure to conduct the inquiry with a violation of Slappy's Sixth Amendment right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.221" offset="3521272">In our view, this extension, this expansion of the Sixth Amendment is unwarranted and unnecessary, and we suggest that it is based, at least in part, upon a misreading of the trial record by the Ninth Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="903.150" offset="3764942">That isn't true, in part because at the time of the continuance request he wasn't asking for Goldfine.</text>

            <label>Mr. Dane R. Gillette</label>
            <text syncTime="1053.760" offset="4367430">No, I think not, and I can address that right now, and I would like to, because it is important to emphasize here that as the Ninth Circuit saw it, the Sixth Amendment violation was not simply that Mr. Hotchkiss rather than Mr. Goldfine represented Slappy, but rather that the judge did not conduct the inquiry, which in its view was required by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.017" offset="4448409">Now, I think as far as determining whether the state trial judge was obligated to conduct that inquiry, one framework for analyzing that issue is to look at the conflict of interest counsel cases which this Court has decided over the last few years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.965" offset="4508178">The first of those cases was Holloway versus Arkansas in 1978, in which it held that where you had three defendants represented by a single public defender who said that in his view there was a conflict of interest, that the failure by the trial judge in that case to respond to that request by the defense attorney, coupled with the requests by the three individual defendants for separate counsel, constituted a violation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, not just because they had a single attorney, but because no response was made to the requests for separate counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.905" offset="4647985">Holloway was followed in 1980 by Cyler versus Sullivan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.730" offset="4667316">There you had three defendants, each represented by the same two retained attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.744" offset="4687378">At no time during the state proceedings was there ever any objection to this joint representation, nor did it appear in the record that there ever was an actual conflict of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.365" offset="4725830">In that case, the Court held that unless the trial judge knew or reasonably should have known that there was a conflict of interest, he was under no sui sponte duty to conduct an inquiry into the possibility of a conflict of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.562" offset="4790614">Then, finally, in 1981, in Wood v. Georgia, the Court found that where you had defendants, several defendants represented by the same attorney who had been hired by the defendants' employer, and who appeared to perhaps have a conflict of interest as between the interests of the defendants and the interests of the employer, that on those facts, the trial judge was reasonably required to conduct an inquiry because he reasonably should have known that there was a possibility of a conflict of interest, and should have determined whether it existed, and if so, whether that conflict was waived by the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.313" offset="4929585">I think that on the facts of this case, we are talking about a situation which is really much closer to Cyler than it is either to Holloway or to Wood v. Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.794" offset="4967515">The trial judge was faced with a specific objection by Mr. Slappy, which was that he did not think Hotchkiss was prepared.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.275" offset="4997503">He was not faced with a request by Mr. Slappy or any statement by Mr. Slappy that he wanted Mr. Goldfine to represent him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.539" offset="5026552">The only way that you can support the Ninth Circuit's conclusion that an inquiry was required on this record is if you agree with what I think is the underlying assumption of the Ninth Circuit, which was that when it became apparent to the judge, or when the judge became aware through the statements of Hotchkiss that there had been a substitution of one deputy public defender for another deputy public defender, at that moment, absent any objection from Mr. Slappy, the judge was required to conduct the inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.026" offset="5136475">We submit that he was not, unless he knew or reasonably should have known that Slappy was objecting to that substitution, and there is nothing in this record which suggests that he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.569" offset="5178689">The judge's only obligation, we submit, on these facts, was to ensure that Mr. Hotchkiss was prepared and was capable of providing effective assistance of counsel because he had enough time to read the record, to meet with his client, and to prepare a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.127" offset="5236889">I think that the Ninth Circuit opinion on these facts really doesn't hold... well, what it really holds is that a defendant has a right to continuous representation, because it is going to obligate a trial judge any time he is aware that there has been a substitution of counsel to conduct that inquiry regardless of any objection by the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.992" offset="5332289">Now, that brings me back to what the Sixth Amendment held... excuse me, what the Ninth Circuit held as an extension of the Sixth Amendment, namely, the right to a meaningful attorney-client relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.284" offset="5381503">The Sixth Amendment, this Court has held, prohibits a trial judge from arbitrarily interfering with the development of the attorney-client relationship, from arbitrarily or unnecessarily interfering with the ability of the defense attorney to represent his client and meet with his client.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.088" offset="5456736">It does not, however, we submit, guarantee a meaningful attorney-client relationship, for that can occur only through the mutual cooperation of the defendant and the attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.474" offset="5502294">If such a relationship fails to develop, that is not a violation of the Sixth Amendment unless it can be shown that there has been judicial interference with the opportunity or ability of the attorney and the defendant to develop that relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.061" offset="5564569">Where all we have is a failure by a trial judge to conduct an inquiry into the reasons why a public defender substituted one trial deputy for another trial deputy, that is not the type of interference which this Court has condemned and which can be said to have interfered with the ability of the defendant to be represented effectively by counsel at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.208" offset="5661223">That, of course, is the key to all Sixth Amendment cases, assuring that the defendant received effective assistance of counsel, and a mere substitution of one trial deputy from a public defender's office for another trial deputy in and of itself is not the kind of act which is likely to have an adverse impact upon the effective representation of the defendant or to otherwise prejudice the defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="3091.139" offset="12516903">He tried on the first day of trial, and succeeded on the second and third.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.090" offset="12536756">It is clear that in the... in the original motion for the continuance and request for specific counsel, that his attorney completely ignored his request, asserting that he was ready to go to trial, and at that point the indigent was effectively pro se and without counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.864" offset="12611779">The important point that we would like to stress in this case is that the defendant's objection does not conclusively bind the trial court, that if the trial court properly exercises discretion, even if it is prejudicial to the defendant to remove counsel or to go to trial or have the defendant go to trial pro se, the trial court can properly make that determination, but only after it fully exercises discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.709" offset="12759214">The case which Mr. Gillette cited, Holloway, we feel is the most similar to this case, not whether the defendant had a fair trial, but whether the trial court's exercise of discretion or failure to do so impacted on his right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.481" offset="12846254">We submit that the issue between effectiveness of counsel and identity of counsel is often difficult to draw, but Slappy's objections in this case go more to the identity of his counsel rather than the sufficiency of counsel's preparation and the effectiveness of Hotchkiss at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.472" offset="12934235">Per se reversal is the appropriate standard when the right to counsel is interfered with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.203" offset="12969134">The interests of providing per se reversal, and I think it is demonstrated by the conflicting opinions in the circuits, are that you can have an evenhanded application of the rule for right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.570" offset="13046666">If the case is analyzed in terms of effective assistance of counsel or an abuse of discretion resulting in the denial of a fair trial, you find conflicting opinions, for example, in the Sixth Circuit and in the Ninth Circuit itself.</text>

            <label>Mr. Dane R. Gillette</label>
            <text syncTime="3401.919" offset="13760018">Yes, I do, Your Honor, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.449" offset="13774124">I have just a couple of points I would like to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.995" offset="13780393">What we see as one of the critical difficulties with this Ninth Circuit opinion was suggested by the questioning of Mr. Justice Rehnquist and Mr. Justice Powell, and that is that carried to its logical extreme, the Ninth Circuit opinion would permit an indigent defendant or any defendant to seek federal habeas corpus relief solely on the grounds that he did not have what he perceived to be a meaningful attorney-client relationship with the attorney who represented him at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.359" offset="13889794">What it does is to transfer the Sixth Amendment determination of whether the Sixth Amendment has been satisfied from whether he had an attorney to whether he had an attorney that he liked.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.308" offset="13933575">It makes it a subjective test, and that simply is not the obligation under the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.852" offset="13955727">He must have an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.461" offset="13962205">He must have an attorney who was individually responsible to his undivided interests, and whose actions are independent of the public defender or the government agency which funds that office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.816" offset="14003583">But the mere fact that he says, I didn't like him, or I couldn't get along with him, standing alone, cannot establish a violation of the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.938" offset="14036080">Now, Mr. Bassi has suggested that what Mr. Slappy was trying to do here was simply say in the best way he could what he really wanted, which was to have Goldfine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.279" offset="14069516">If what he wanted was to have Mr. Goldfine represent him, it took no sophistication, no great feat of art for him to say, I want Mr. Goldfine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.947" offset="14104103">Even when on that first day of trial, when Mr. Hotchkiss told the judge, I was reassigned to the case because Mr. Goldfine is in the hospital, Slappy said nothing.</text>

            <text syncTime="3514.655" offset="14210996">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.607" offset="14214757">Our position is that, first, that the judge had no duty to inquire on this record, but that even if there had been a request, or you can infer a request, the judge's only obligation was to ensure that the public defender who was assigned and who was present at trial had the opportunity to prepare, had access to the record, had an opportunity to meet with his client, and was ready to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.926" offset="14308067">Mr. Hotchkiss had an obligation when asked by the trial judge if he was ready to proceed to say, yes, he was, if in fact he was ready.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.142" offset="14340981">He had an obligation as an officer of the court not to mislead the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.469" offset="14354251">The final point I want to make here is that what really happened, what is really happening in this case is that I think the Ninth Circuit has once again, unfortunately, confused its power to have supervisory control over the federal trial courts with its responsibility in cases of habeas corpus not to set aside state convictions unless there has been a constitutional violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.975" offset="14444217">If the Ninth Circuit wants to say that defendants who are represented by... who are being tried in federal district court and are being represented by federal public defenders have these kinds of rights, that is fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.658" offset="14486953">They can do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.283" offset="14489461">They have that supervisory power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.533" offset="14494476">We see nothing in the Sixth Amendment which compels it as an aspect of the Sixth Amendment, and because of that, we submit the Ninth Circuit's decision was incorrect, and again, we ask this Court to reverse it.</text>
