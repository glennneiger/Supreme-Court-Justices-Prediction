            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="5.701" offset="115118">This case is hereon certiorari to the Court Of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.149" offset="136852">Under South Dakota's Habitual Offender Law, respondent Helm was sentenced to life imprisonment without possibility of parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.642" offset="178857">This sentence was occasioned by his issuing a $100 check without an account.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.024" offset="208427">This is a felony in South Dakota and was Helm's seventh offense. Over a period of 15 years, all classified as felonies under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.582" offset="262657">The other six offenses also were nonviolent.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.586" offset="282615">They included third-degree burglaries obtaining money under false pretenses, a larceny as defined by the State and drunk driving.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.746" offset="327232">Respondent was 36-year-old at the time of his sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.852" offset="347712">He was not a professional criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.256" offset="357325">He is addicted to alcohol with consequent difficulty in obtaining employment and retaining it.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.322" offset="385537">After exhausting state remedies, Helm sought habeas corpus relief in federal court contending that his sentence constituted cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.612" offset="438723">The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit agreed and granted the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.084" offset="460666">Now, prior cases established that the Eighth Amendment prohibits disproportionate sentences, as well as punishment that is inherently barbaric.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.826" offset="507581">In determining disproportionality, we examine a number of objective factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.531" offset="530360">These factors are set forth in the opinion we file today.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.511" offset="550318">On the basis of these factors, we find that respondent's sentence to life imprisonment without possibility of parole is grossly disproportionate to his crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.931" offset="595980">Accordingly, we affirm the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.108" offset="608728">Our opinion makes clear however that invalidating an imprisonment sentence imposed under state law is action reserved only for the most exceptional cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.927" offset="655957">The Chief Justice has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices White, Rehnquist and O'Connor joined.</text>
