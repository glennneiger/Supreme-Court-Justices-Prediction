            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="7.071" offset="120560">This case involves the claim that a state tax deduction violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment which prohibits any law respecting the establishment of a religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.553" offset="170506">Thirty five years ago, this Court faced the question of whether a New Jersey locality could provide school transportation to children attending parochial schools and it is decided by a narrowly divided court that it could.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.270" offset="241350">And since that time, the question has recurred time and again.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.019" offset="264338">The arguments in the legislatures that the parochial school people make are that the parochial schools do a substantial job of educating a large number of students that the parents of parochial students paid taxes which support the public schools and they pay an addition tuition to go -- for their kids to go to the parochial schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.690" offset="359006">And so, they have claimed that they were equitably entitled to some sort of tax benefit as a result of this double payment on their part.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.057" offset="400488">The arguments and opposition in the legislatures have been that the public schools are open to everybody, that it's a perfectly voluntary choice that the parochial school parents make to send their children to school and that the public treasury shouldn't underwrite that sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.347" offset="465690">Well, in addition, the claim has been raised by those who oppose any sort of aid to a parochial schools, that a state law which gives some sort of benefit like this violates the First Amendment and its Establishment Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.091" offset="528697">Today, we consider a claim asserted in that manner against a Minnesota statute which permits taxpayers to deduct part of the cost of educating their children from their taxable income. Among its expenses that may be deducted are the cost of tuition, the cost of transportation to schools, textbooks, and other incidental items.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.480" offset="622216">A group of Minnesota taxpayers filed suit in federal court arguing that the statute was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.043" offset="652518">They claimed that although the statute in theory applied to a broad range of people, its principal beneficiaries would be parents of children attending parochial schools who were able to deduct the cost of tuition, books, and transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.836" offset="707688">They relied principally on our decision in a case called Nyquist decided 10 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.880" offset="735796">The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit rejected this claim and held that the Minnesota plan conformed to the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.045" offset="768501">Like the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, we are unpersuaded by petitioner's reliance on Nyquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.077" offset="792639">Although that case involved a state law similar in a number of respects to that in that in this case, we have concluded that the decision, that the opinion differs from this case in a number of important ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.397" offset="841853">The Minnesota law, unlike the law in Nyquist benefits a very broad class of citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.949" offset="864110">It is part of a genuine tax system and thus is entitled to a substantial deference from the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.904" offset="887933">For these reasons, as well as others set out tin the opinion for the Court, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit and hold that Minnesota's law does not violate the Establishment Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.131" offset="932864">Justice Marshall has filed a dissenting opinion which he is joined by Justice Brennan, Justice Blackmun and Justice Stevens.</text>
