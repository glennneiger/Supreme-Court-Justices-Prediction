            <text syncTime="13.852" offset="197812">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="18.492" offset="216306">This appeal involves a suit to determine the ownership of a 1978 new Piper Navajo airplane sold to both parties in the suit by a fraudulent dealer.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.657" offset="277015">Plaintiff Shacket brought suit in the U.S. district court for a declaratory judgment seeking a determination of the ownership of the Piper Navajo airplane in him.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.853" offset="345769">The Defendant Philko Aviation counterclaimed against Shacket.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.289" offset="379519">As to the ownership of the aircraft, the district court awarded ownership to the Plaintiff Shacket.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.627" offset="412852">There were other counts of fraud, conspiracy, wrongful conversion, and requests for damages, and all of those counts were held by the lower court against the party making the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.621" offset="476904">The Defendant Smith and Smith Aircraft Sales, Inc., the dealer involved in this dispute, did not answer or plead and judgment, default judgment, was taken against that Defendant, together with $29,000 attorney's fees in favor of Plaintiff Shacket.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.141" offset="578990">Philko appealed to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals and the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the U.S. district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.339" offset="631758">Philko subsequently petitioned to this honorable Court by writ of certiorari and that certiorari was granted, but limited to the first issue presented by the Petitioner Philko as to the question presented: Does state law permit a conveyance of title to aircraft by transfer of possession alone, without the necessity of FAA recording.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.516" offset="760489">Both the Plaintiff Shacket and Philko through Mr. Edward J. McArdle, its president, had had prior dealings, not directly related to this lawsuit, with Roger Smith or Smith Aviation, Inc., the dealer involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.379" offset="859859">Mr. Shacket's first contact with Smith was in 1972, wherein he traded one aircraft for another, and that was in Smith's context as a dealer of used aircraft.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.186" offset="935092">Mr. McArdle or Philko or corporations related to McArdle Limited, which was Mr. McArdle's holding company for several business corporations engaged in the leisure time business, became acquainted on a chance meeting with Roger Smith at DuPage County Airport, became apprised of the availability for purchase of a fixed base operation at Aurora Municipal Airport in Aurora, Illinois, and subsequently formed a new Delaware corporation called Philko to buy the assets of Philko Aviation in Aurora.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.651" offset="1096946">He then leased that facility to Roger Smith Aircraft Sales, Inc., and Roger Smith Aircraft Sales, Inc., sold fuel, oil and service under the trade name Philko, whereas he maintained his sale of used aircraft under the name Roger Smith Aircraft Sales, Inc.--</text>
            <text syncTime="266.485" offset="1208332">Sometime on or about November of '77 Roger Smith persuaded or sold a new 1978 Piper Navajo airplane to Shacket by means of a purchase order.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.180" offset="1291088">The plane had not at that time been manufactured.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.647" offset="1304985">The purchase order was signed and $20,000 was deposited by Shacket at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.487" offset="1340303">The delivery was to be in early 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.139" offset="1358902">In April 19th of 1978, Shacket, after being advised the plane was then ready for delivery, appeared at Aurora Airport from his home in Detroit preparatory to closing and taking possession of the aircraft.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.913" offset="1446047">At that time Mr. Shacket paid an additional $106,000 in cash and he had at a prior time given up possession to a 1972 Piper Navajo airplane which was to be used as the trade-in.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.575" offset="1524728">So that the total consideration paid by Shacket was the $20,000 at the time of execution of the agreement, $106,000 at the time he took possession and the delivery into Roger Smith Aircraft, Inc. 's hands of a '72 Piper Navajo some time in March of '78.</text>

            <text syncTime="384.625" offset="1680835">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.296" offset="1691598">Mr. Shacket took possession of the airplane after being shown copies of the title documents conveying title from Piper in a complete chain up to and including Smith Aviation, Inc. Smith Aviation, Inc., through Roger Smith, provided him with a buyer's copy of the bill of sale conveying from Smith Aviation to Maurice Shacket.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.187" offset="1835167">Maurice Shacket had asked for the original documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.512" offset="1852408">He was told that they weren't ready.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.154" offset="1858990">He returned to Detroit, but left his friend Mr. Hamburg, who was staying a day later, to bring the copy.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.010" offset="1894412">The same story was told to Mr. Hamburg, who did not get the original documents necessary for filing with the FAA.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.880" offset="1929939">Next day, on or about April 20th, Mr. Smith takes all of the original documents necessary to file with the FAA and presents them to Mr. McArdle, with the story that he was going to try to borrow $151,000 on the aircraft, but it was exceeding his line of credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.122" offset="2022830">Mr. McArdle declined through his corporation to extend any further credit to Roger Smith Aircraft, but did agree ultimately to buy the aircraft.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.755" offset="2077374">He bought the aircraft by paying $152,000 in cash and cancelling an antecedent debt of $60,000, which had not yet become due but which was shortly to become due.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.655" offset="2144979">Mr. McArdle did so, however, only after his bank, who was the provider of the $152,000 cash and was going to make the loan on the aircraft, inspected the documents, determined them to be valid documents, had checked with the FAA recording facility in Oklahoma City, determined that the Piper aircraft had been manufactured and that there were no intervening title interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.082" offset="2242677">At that point Mr. McArdle authorized the disbursement of funds for the loan to be delivered to or for the account of Roger Smith Aircraft Sales.</text>

            <text syncTime="549.870" offset="2341838">Well, we have a slight difference, Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.819" offset="2361691">Shacket was perhaps a buyer in the ordinary course under the UCC.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.366" offset="2387813">Philko was a purchaser, a good faith purchaser for value.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.549" offset="2408607">The difference being under our UCC, Mr. Chief Justice, is one uses an antecedent debt as part of the consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.624" offset="2440894">At any rate, the documents were duly filed with the FAA on or about May 31st.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.309" offset="2475585">They were noted as filed for record.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.917" offset="2486034">About June, mid-June, Shacket had found out of McArdle's interest, and that was the first contact Mr. McArdle had or was aware of Shacket's involvement in the transaction.</text>

            <text syncTime="606.176" offset="2567118">He took possession of the airplane at the time he paid his money.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.546" offset="2584568">Mr. McArdle was told that the aircraft was in Michigan with a Piper dealer being fitted with avionics.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.108" offset="2614765">We have here, then, a conflict between the Illinois Uniform Commercial Code and the federal recording statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="665.417" offset="2803996">So your focus is on the impact of the federal statute.</text>

          <turn speaker="leslie_r_bishop" startTime="669.710" stopTime="843.609">
            <label>Mr. Leslie R. Bishop</label>
            <text syncTime="669.710" offset="2821237">That is correct, yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.384" offset="2827924">The federal statute says under 1403 that no document will be accorded validity as to third parties without notice unless and until it is filed for record.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.424" offset="2880065">Shacket never filed his interest for record.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.172" offset="2891036">McArdle or Philko, looking at the FAA records through its bank, finds no intervening interest, has all of the original documents in its hands, duly files them with the FAA.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.229" offset="2947252">Plaintiff... Shacket makes the allegation, well, even if we had sent them down for recording you would not have known in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.693" offset="2997198">But that really begs the question, because if they'd been sent down for proper recording at Oklahoma City you wouldn't have had the documents in Smith's hands to perpetrate the fraud in Philko.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.924" offset="3042128">So we have an interplay here of two statutes, one under the Illinois Uniform Commercial Code that would purport to pass title by possession of the document, and the enactment of 1401 and 1403 which require the registration of an owner of aircraft, and upon that registration under 1401 either having the document recorded under 1403 or having recordable documents under 1403.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.240" offset="3179323">Shacket takes the position that if you look at 1406 you are directed to the state law in which the document is delivered.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.730" offset="3237315">1406 was enacted in 1964 to solve a problem that dealt with the choice of law to determine the respective rights or validities of the parties of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.414" offset="3308055">That is to say that you had a choice of where the aircraft was located, you had a choice of the place of execution or place of delivery.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.597" offset="3344731">1406, appropriately, we think, chose the place of delivery of the document as the most logical choice for highly mobile, highly valuable pieces of machinery, where often consortiums of lenders, 60 or more, get together.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.652" offset="3417038">One reads the Congressional Record and you come away with the inescapable conclusion that, in their analysis of enacting 1406, they are viewing 1406 as a choice of law, a federal choice of law as to the parties to that agreement to determine validity.</text>

            <text syncTime="843.609" offset="3516825">Well, Mr. Bishop, I think you've got some problems in your argument with the language of Section 1406.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.576" offset="3540649">It says</text>
            <text syncTime="850.468" offset="3544202">"the validity of any instrument the recording of which is provided for by section 503. "</text>
            <text syncTime="855.120" offset="3562905">"shall be governed by the laws of the state. "</text>
            <text syncTime="856.870" offset="3569906">Now, why shouldn't the UCC govern as to priorities under that section?</text>

            <label>Mr. Leslie R. Bishop</label>
            <text syncTime="862.319" offset="3591640">Well, it's a question I think where we have our problem, Mr. Justice, is that if you have resort to state law for substantive ownership rights, you've gone beyond the scope of 1406.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.564" offset="3656633">The determination of validity is, quite properly I think, limited to the execution: Is it proper, does it properly describe the asset, does it meet the test of that jurisdiction in which it's delivered, and, analyzed from the two parties that are involved in that particular instrument, does it meet the test as a valid instrument?</text>
            <text syncTime="903.852" offset="3757779">Obviously, you must have some machinery to eliminate fraudulent acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.519" offset="3780453">But the minute you logically extend 1406 into the substantive law of the state, now you're giving credence to a transfer of ownership, if you will, without having recorded it under 1403.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.218" offset="3843252">And 1403 says no interest in any aircraft will be valid unless recorded in 1403.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.183" offset="3871150">So 1406 can't be used to bypass the effect of recording under 1403 without making 1403 almost a useless tool.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.397" offset="3915976">The object of recording was to provide for the Government and for the aviation industry a rather neat set of rules whereby lenders could take some comfort in the status of title; whereby investment capital would flow in in such a way that lenders or investors would be reasonably certain to have an interest in the specific chattel that they're looking at; and so that the Government would be empowered to send out notices to owners of defects discovered by the Federal Aviation Administration.</text>

            <text syncTime="1293.800" offset="5317603">They examined in the Congressional deliberations at great length what the alternatives were and gave some almost scary examples of the problems engendered with, say, a small airline fleet flying over the country, trying to make a mortgage with a consortium of banks out of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.541" offset="5412584">They discussed the problems with analyzing the transaction from the location of the aircraft, some of which were in the air and operational at the time, and the choice of law keyed into the point of execution, but often you have multiple signers of a document in different locations, and finally came to the resolution that the one thing that generally happened to any document about one time was its delivery, and it wasn't an effective instrument in most every jurisdiction until delivery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.477" offset="5568274">So 1406 very correctly selected the place of delivery as the federal choice of law to determine the validity of the document.</text>

            <text syncTime="1443.769" offset="5917479">That's under 1401 and it involves then the registration of the aircraft which is necessary to operate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.906" offset="5949975">But it also says under 1401 that this shall not be determinative of any title if that title is in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.450" offset="5984143">Then you drop down to 1403 and, while there is no affirmative compelling statutory language to record under 1403, it very clearly says that if you don't record the instrument isn't valid as to third parties without notice... clearly, as much a penalty clause as one could hope for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.268" offset="6087483">And if you have no validity for an unrecorded instrument, whether that transaction is represented by a document or not, if 1403 says you have no validity you have nothing to consider under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.088" offset="6170762">And yet you look at the various state statutes that deal with personal property and that transfers personal property all over the place by delivery of possession.</text>

            <text syncTime="1954.955" offset="7962239">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.734" offset="7973315">In essence, this case only requires this Court to consider basically four factors, four factors that are determined, already determined, either by the U.S. district court or the Court of Appeals, and are reflected in the depositions that were taken in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.084" offset="8042696">It is undisputed that Philko Aviation recorded bills of sale, the original bills of sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.957" offset="8074252">Whether Mr. McArdle saw the original bills of sale at the time he consummated his transaction is a question, but it's unimportant for this Court to determine the issue before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.437" offset="8120123">The second fact is that my client on April 19th, 1978, took possession of his $235,000 custom-made vanity number aircraft, flew it off from Aurora Airport and flew it to Detroit, and he has been in possession of that aircraft since that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.833" offset="8217717">The third fact that this Court has to look at is that the district court and the Court of Appeals, based upon this record, determined that my clients had title interest in this aircraft under state law under two separate theories: one, it was a buyer in the ordinary course of business; and second, it was a bona fide purchaser for value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.356" offset="8315833">The fourth factor is that both the district court and the Court of Appeals determined that Philko Aviation was not a buyer in the ordinary course of business, and the Court of Appeals determined that it was not a bona fide purchaser for value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.957" offset="8382184">And let me address the question, Mr. Chief Justice, that you asked Mr. Bishop regarding whether or not Philko Aviation was a bona fide purchaser for value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.951" offset="8422203">It is clear under Illinois law that it would not be, and the reason under 2-401, subparagraph (2) of the Uniform Commercial Code, there is one element.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.807" offset="8473612">Although Mr. Bishop is correct, he did give value under the Uniform Commercial Code, an antecedent debt, if he cancelled it... and that's a question... if he had cancelled the antecedent debt, that would give value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.817" offset="8525648">But what he didn't tell you is the fact that under Illinois law you have to physically take possession of the goods, the delivery of the goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.658" offset="8565041">And the Code speaks, that section of the Code speaks, about physical delivery of the goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.797" offset="8589596">It doesn't talk about delivery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.778" offset="8597537">Those are the essential--</text>

            <text syncTime="2181.391" offset="8867957">One of those interests is that your borrower has a proprietary interest in the aircraft.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.794" offset="8905573">Their interest is predicated on the bill of sale between Philko Aviation and Roger Smith Aircraft Sales.</text>

            <text syncTime="2995.683" offset="12125113">Shacket's nonrecording against Philko is not fatal to Shacket's superior rights under controlling state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.948" offset="12154161">There is nothing in the legislative history which suggests that Congress intended to supplant state substantive law relating to titles to aircraft.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.802" offset="12193554">It merely intended to be a simple... simply a central repository.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.377" offset="12227931">And in order to determine a legislative intent, because there really is... and Petitioner and I both agree... there is a total absence of legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.683" offset="12269100">And I have attempted to try to locate the hearings, and it's been very difficult, in order to find out what this is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.790" offset="12293550">I can tell you that Senator Patrick McCarran, Senator from Nevada, from 1935 had submitted various bills.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.835" offset="12333674">Then Senator Truman, who was... this bill, which ended up the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938, was the floor manager for this bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.517" offset="12384456">And if you look at the drafts of the various Senate and House bills dating back to 1936, you will not find any language of 1403 or comparable language of 1403.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.339" offset="12431686">It was only in the last bill, that was eventually passed by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.180" offset="12459062">So because there seems to be an absence of legislative history, we must look at comparable statutes that were in existence at the time this statute was enacted, and that statute is the Ship Mortgage Act of 1930.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.345" offset="12527712">That statute has a very similar recording provision as 1403.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.545" offset="12564597">Yet Congress in the Ship Mortgage Act defines various types of interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.152" offset="12602945">For example, it defines what is to be construed under the statute as a preferred mortgage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.103" offset="12626768">It then sets forth in very specific detail as to what needs to be contained in a preferred mortgage, and then it sets out priority rules with respect to such preferred mortgage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.503" offset="12688417">This statute was in existence at the time Congress enacted the Civil Aeronautics Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.219" offset="12711301">As an aid for interpretation you look at the whole statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.511" offset="12732408">You do not look and focus your attention on just one provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.338" offset="12755709">One provision that was in existence at the time the statute was enacted was Section 501(f).</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.537" offset="12788519">Now, Section 501(f) deals with registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.334" offset="12799699">But in order to register an aircraft under the FAA, you must attach ownership interests, basically the bills of sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.379" offset="12839928">And yet, under 501 they say, if you register an aircraft it is not presumed or is not a decision as to who has title.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.514" offset="12880470">And then we look, in 1964 we look at Section 1406.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.555" offset="12920594">And they talk about the validity of any instrument the recording of which shall be governed by the laws of the state in which such instrument is delivered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.490" offset="12960300">It is clear, Justice Stevens, that this is merely a choice of law forum, as to what law to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.988" offset="12994363">Petitioner would have this Court and suggests to this Court that all that provision did is we look to the mechanics of execution of the documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.561" offset="13032607">But the legislative history, which is not clear... I'm not suggesting it is... but it seems to indicate, because I have quoted a portion of it in my brief from the hearings and they quoted another section of it, but it seems to me when you read the Senate reports, where they look to the Senate report to determine the validity of such instrument, one would need only look to the substantive law of the particular place in which the relevant instrument is delivered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.781" offset="13165518">Now, it doesn't define substantive law there, but my understanding of it and I think any reasonable person's understand is substantive law is the substantive law as far as, if that instrument would convey an interest in property you look to that state's law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.134" offset="13234899">If it would not, then that instrument, the fact that it's recorded has no validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.302" offset="13259559">And vis a vis my client, that's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.925" offset="13274083">They don't have title, and the fact of their recording does not vest title in Philko Aviation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.125" offset="13298847">Then we look at the interpretation... and in addition, with respect... with respect to this particular interpretation, the... it is of particular note that the letter from the then current Administrator of the FAA to Senator Warren Magnusen relating to Section 1406, and that letter is part of the Senate report, which states in pertinent part:</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.800" offset="13445550">"As in the case with the recording system, substantive validity of recorded instruments remains a question of local law. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.970" offset="13478256">Then we look at the current regulations of the FAA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.449" offset="13500199">Now, obviously... and I am not attempting to suggest that this Court is bound to take into consideration the regulations of the FAA when in this Court's opinion that it believes directly contravenes the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.456" offset="13592254">However, I do suggest to you, and this Court has held, as we've pointed out in our brief, that you give great weight to the interpretations of agencies that have been vested by Congress for the implementation of a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.217" offset="13667278">And under 14 CFR Section 4917 of that statute, it states:</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.758" offset="13697371">"The recording of a conveyance is not a decision of the FAA that the instrument does in fact affect title to or an interest in the aircraft or other property it covers. "</text>

            <text syncTime="3517.567" offset="14212610">My analysis of that statute is that all that... or that treaty, the Mortgage Convention Act... and all I can give you, Justice O'Connor, is my reading of the Mortgage Convention Act... under Article 1, paragraph 2, makes clear that each contracting state's substantive law will control rights in an aircraft.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.834" offset="14325668">There is no need to adopt a uniform national law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.208" offset="14355239">Article 17 of the Mortgage Convention permits contract states to reference the law of territories.</text>

            <text syncTime="3578.948" offset="14458161">In addition, under Section... when Section 506 or 1406 was enacted by Congress in 1964, the State Department sent a letter to the Senate, and they had the reports and they read it, and they said that they had no objection to 1406.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.389" offset="14567980">And I have to submit and I think we have to agree that in my opinion it does affect substantive title law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3619.960" offset="14622210">The state's law concept of possession as a factor in determining substantive ownership interest does not violate any federal interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.662" offset="14661080">The question that somehow lenders are going to be disabused for investing in an airplane if you don't have a central recording is just simply nonsense.</text>
