            <label>Mr. David L. Freeman</label>
            <text syncTime="13.824" offset="209748">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.626" offset="220929">With the Court's permission, I will first have a brief opening statement, then address myself to the question of jurisdiction, and then proceed with the balance of my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.065" offset="254679">On March 7th, 1979, Jonathan Lehr was deprived of the most basic and precious of all human rights, the right to maintain his status as a parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.506" offset="296475">For on that date Jessica, whom Mr. Lehr had always openly acknowledged to be his daughter, both before and after birth, was adopted by the Appellee, Richard Robertson, the husband of the natural mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.981" offset="350391">According to New York law, as a result of that adoption Mr. Lehr's rights as a parent were forever and irrevocably extinguished.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.520" offset="384455">There would be no more contacts of any nature with Jessica, no visitations, no rights of inheritance.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.090" offset="410786">Mr. Lehr was deprived of this child without being given the opportunity of notice and the opportunity to be heard, for according to the New York statutory scheme then in force and effect Mr. Lehr was precluded from receiving notice as those statutes were construed and applied to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.437" offset="496155">What makes this lack of notice even more emphatic was the fact that at the very time that Mr. Lehr's rights were being stripped in the adoption proceeding in Ulster County, he had commenced a paternity petition in Westchester County, unbeknown to him that the adoption proceedings were pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.399" offset="563969">In Westchester County he asserted his rights as a parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.435" offset="580164">He asked that the child be adjudicated and that he be made the father, that he be given visitation rights and that he be given the right to support Jessica.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.141" offset="619035">The family court judge in Ulster County knew of this petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.110" offset="634813">Mr. Lehr had to assert his rights in this manner because he was prevented from asserting them after Jessica's birth, for after Mr. Lehr's last visit at the hospital during father's visiting hours to see Jessica, Lorraine, the natural mother, withheld the whereabouts of Jessica for approximately six months, after which Mr. Lehr had an opportunity to see Jessica on a couple of weekends, and thereafter for approximately 14 months before Mr. Lehr instituted these paternity proceedings Lorraine Robertson withheld the whereabouts of Jessica from Mr. Lehr.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.718" offset="781307">Mr. Lehr tried desperately to find Jessica.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.984" offset="790398">However, he was unsuccessful until right before he started the paternity proceedings, at which time he sought counsel and then asserted his rights as a father in the paternity proceeding in Westchester County.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.044" offset="846613">This Court has raised the question of jurisdiction as to whether or not it has the right to hear this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.614" offset="872840">Mr. Lehr claims and has claimed in all three courts below that he was denied of his constitutional rights of due process and equal protection by virtue of the fact that the New York statutory scheme as construed and applied to him denied him notice and the opportunity to be heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.859" offset="941908">In particular, I'm referring to Sections 111(a) and 111 of the New York domestic relations law.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.380" offset="967926">By the terms and provisions of that law, in particular Section 111(a), only seven categories of unwed fathers were entitled to receive notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.386" offset="1003975">According to the record, Mr. Lehr was not one of these, although there is a question as to whether or not he might have fit into one of these categories, as to whether or not Lorraine, the natural mother, had filed a written sworn statement indicating that Mr. Lehr was the father.</text>

            <text syncTime="1596.145" offset="6539009">And the third point is that the Appellant never had and never sought custody of the child, which meant that regardless of what the Appellant said in any court anywhere that child was going to continue to live in the mother's household and was going to continue to be the de facto child of the stepfather.</text>

            <text syncTime="2044.093" offset="8330800">"Whatever might be required in other situations, we cannot say that the state was required in this situation to find anything more than that the adoption, and denial of legitimation, were in the best interest of the child. "</text>

            <text syncTime="2058.601" offset="8388791">There were two safety valves:</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.868" offset="8393911">One, New York law provides that he could have moved to intervene even after the signing of the order.</text>

            <text syncTime="2082.468" offset="8484295">And this is what the Court of Appeals noted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.686" offset="8501118">There is a Section 114 of the domestic relations law, which says that for good cause shown an application can be made to the court showing why the adoption should not be set aside.</text>

            <text syncTime="2126.877" offset="8661928">All he had to do is make his allegations, lay out a prima facie case as to why he thought the adoption should not go through and why it was not in the child's best interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.149" offset="8699022">Bear in mind that the scope of his participation prior to Caban was strictly what is in the best interest of the child.</text>

            <label>Mr. David L. Freeman</label>
            <text syncTime="3342.379" offset="13523942">Briefly, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.048" offset="13530630">There's two points I'd like to point out here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.150" offset="13543064">I'm glad that Caban point was cleared up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.485" offset="13556334">The very fact that this case goes back does not necessarily mean that this adoption will not remain or that the parents will be broken up or that custody will be changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.107" offset="13598862">New York has a continuous relationship statute, as Justice O'Connor has indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.411" offset="13616102">Great mention here has been made of the fact that Mr. Lehr has not shown in his affidavit sufficient facts which would warrant the belief that he would have any input into the best interest hearing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.533" offset="13660511">Due process does not say that because one... once one is entitled to notice under due process, you must wipe the slate clean, as this Court has said in Armstrong versus Manzo, go back to the position where he would have been had he been given notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.593" offset="13724772">The fact that... the facts that show that he might not be entitled to the substantive relief that he may be requesting does not have anything to do with his right to notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.434" offset="13768135">Much also has been made about this intervention motion here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.603" offset="13784853">In substance, probably, the intervention motion was made by the motion to vacate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.040" offset="13806587">It's in fact the same type of motion, asking to be a party in the proceedings.</text>

            <label>Mr. David L. Freeman</label>
            <text syncTime="3430.834" offset="13877745">There should be a starting of de novo, or possibly, there is the other possibility, where a hearing would be held as if the adoption had not taken place, giving the Appellant all the rights that he would have had had he been given notice originally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.828" offset="13941693">All we're asking for is to be heard on whatever substantive rights we may have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.897" offset="13961964">We don't know what substantive rights we're going to have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.366" offset="13967920">They're going to depend on our contacts with the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.783" offset="13977533">The New York statute now provides that one of the factors that's taken into consideration is whether or not the father was prevented from seeing the child by the mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.855" offset="14013791">And in addition, the New York statute provides that the amount of support which he is required to give is dependent upon his financial circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="3489.422" offset="14112115">With respect to the intervention motion, what the Appellees are contending is that in order to get due process one must file a notice to intervene, and that of course does not follow from what our Constitution says.</text>
