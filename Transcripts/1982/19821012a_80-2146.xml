            <text syncTime="112.343" offset="617730">The facts are extremely simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.836" offset="627761">The defendant was arrested at the Miami International Airport carrying 65 pounds of marijuana in his luggage.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.092" offset="660780">The state's witness, Detective Johnson, an experienced narcotics officer, testified generally as to his training and profile, so-called A, so-called D, a profile, and the fact that he observed thousands of passengers each week at the Miami International Airport eight hours a day, five days a week.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.245" offset="749387">On January 3rd, 1978, about noon, the defendant appeared at the airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.469" offset="774256">Detective Johnson testified that in his experience and Detective Magdalena's experience, it was undeniable that the defendant's conduct and demeanor attracted their attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.147" offset="820963">The defendant was extremely nervous, pale, uneasy, looking about, and Detective Johnson testified that in his experience, the defendant was not a so-called white knuckled flier, but rather was concerned about being detected.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.399" offset="889926">The bags the defendant was carrying were very heavy.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.001" offset="912391">He had produced an extremely large roll of cash to pay for his ticket.</text>

            <text syncTime="258.901" offset="1204022">Johnson then told the defendant that they believed that he was carrying narcotics, and would he come to a room a few feet away for further discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.047" offset="1248535">Johnson said the defendant was thoroughly cooperative throughout the transaction.</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="1276.591" offset="5274736">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case has several issues in it that are of great importance doctrinally to Fourth Amendment law and to federal law enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.231" offset="5333250">If you analyze the sequence of events that arose here, you begin with the initial contact between the agents and Mr. Royer, and there is an issue whether at that point you had a seizure of his person within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment or simply a contact not regulated by the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.703" offset="5415170">That issue is important because if you had a seizure, you can consider in the effort to justify that seizure only the facts known to the agents at the time they first approached Mr. Royer, and not facts that they learned during the initial interview with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.554" offset="5482566">Now, when the situs of the transaction moved from the concourse to the office nearby, you have a question whether that movement was either fully voluntary and not subject to the Fourth Amendment, as was said in Mendenhall, or a continuation of an investigative detention, or an arrest requiring probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.085" offset="5604715">Now, I would like to turn first to the arrest issue, because I believe that is what the state court rested on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.880" offset="5635853">There is, of course, a final issue as to whether the consent to the search of the suitcases was voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.433" offset="5658109">I won't address that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.825" offset="5663647">I don't think it was decided by the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.357" offset="5673782">The rationale of the lower court was a fruits rationale, that even if the consent was voluntary, it was the product of an antecedent illegal seizure of Mr. Royer's person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.283" offset="5713488">Now, I think it is crystal clear that the lower court used the wrong test in identifying whether Mr. Royer was under arrest at the time he was moved to the office and the consent was secured.</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="1424.977" offset="5868238">Well, not for my point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.359" offset="5873776">I absolutely agree that the test is an objective one, and not his subjective belief or the subjective intentions of the officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.153" offset="5905018">But the point that I am making here is that the test of free to leave is a test that distinguishes not arrests from non-arrests, but Fourth Amendment seizures from non-seizures, and it is well settled that Fourth Amendment seizures consist of two kinds of things, the Terry type investigative detention or an arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.808" offset="5983595">One can be based on reasonable suspicion not amounting to probable cause; the latter requires probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.370" offset="6009822">Now, in deciding whether what happened here was an arrest, it seems to me that it strains the English language and the logical structure of Fourth Amendment analysis to call this an arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.589" offset="6054752">If you view these events as occurring to an innocent traveler who has mistakenly been seized upon as a possible drug courier by the agents, it would be quite clear to that person that he had not yet been arrested, that he was being detained for a brief course of investigation which would result in his release if he knew he was innocent after the officers looked in the luggage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.394" offset="6149942">It did not have the indicia of duration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.005" offset="6164362">If you compare it to Dunaway, you are talking about moving him a number of miles to the police station, keeping him for an indefinite period until he confessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.211" offset="6201247">From the standpoint of Mr. Dunaway, even if he were innocent, he would have perceived what happened to him, I think, quite clearly as being... having the essential attributes of a formal arrest, which is the language the Court used last term in Michigan against Summers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.061" offset="6260597">Now, it is important in our view not to place undue emphasis in defining an arrest on the factors that the lower court here, the en banc court relied upon, which is movement or detention or extended custody beyond a momentary stop, because those factors may arise in many contexts where we believe that they can be legitimately done as part of an investigative detention, for instance, the detention of a suspected robber near the scene of the robbery and the question whether he could be moved, let's say, a block to the scene of the robbery for purposes of a show-up without having probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.880" offset="6431856">Now, let me say finally on the arrest issue that if you don't say this was not an arrest, that does not leave the subject of investigative detentions unregulated under the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.628" offset="6478876">An investigative detention, like an arrest, must be reasonable, and you have the ability to say in this case that the detention under the circumstances may have been unreasonable, but calling it an arrest, I think, would be most unfortunate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2320.325" offset="9449626">Now, what our position is is that whatever Terry stop may have been justified in the first instance in this matter became increasingly more custodial and ultimately culminated in an illegal arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.064" offset="9508662">The traditional dividing point has always been, of course, probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.779" offset="9527471">The Terry case recognized an intermediate step which was limited in nature and in purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.101" offset="9552757">It is between the contact and an arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.264" offset="9565400">Articulable suspicion permits a limited seizure of the person, but it must be done with the clear caveat that whatever intrusion takes place pursuant to this seizure must be limited to that which made its initiation permissible in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.245" offset="9637394">So that asking a seized driver to get out of his car for the immediate safety of the officer has been upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.590" offset="9662680">A patdown, as in Terry, has been upheld.</text>

            <text syncTime="4023.658" offset="16262987">I would like to address why the voluntariness issue in this Court should be overturned, and that is, this Court's various holdings, and we quote United States versus Price that a finding of consent should not be overturned unless it is clearly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="4038.928" offset="16324114">The evidence in this case is not so overwhelming that either this Court or the District Court of Appeal en banc should overturn both the panel opinion and the trial court on the question of voluntariness.</text>
            <text syncTime="4051.246" offset="16373328">The defendant just stated that this was a police room, and the witnesses so testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="4058.011" offset="16400391">In fact, Johnson was asked,</text>
            <text syncTime="4060.242" offset="16409377">"Is that an official police room. "</text>
            <text syncTime="4061.973" offset="16416274">"No, it's a closet that has shelves on one end. "</text>

            <text syncTime="4071.509" offset="16454413">The police room is something that the Third District called this room.</text>
            <text syncTime="4075.252" offset="16469355">It is not something that it was in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4077.213" offset="16477191">With respect to why the defendant was stopped... assuming the defendant was detained... excuse me... when he was taken to the room, he was not detained because he had American Tourister luggage, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4091.014" offset="16532466">He was detained because of numerous facts and circumstances, not the least of which included the profile as a written indication of the officers' experience, and particularly his efforts to avoid detection as are observed by the officers, and particularly Johnson's observations of the defendant's counter-surveillance, if you will.</text>
