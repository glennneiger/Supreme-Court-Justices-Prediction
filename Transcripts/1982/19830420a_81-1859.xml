            <text syncTime="81.265" offset="471447">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.232" offset="483359">The Fourth Amendment, through the requirement of warrants based upon probable cause, seeks to protect citizens and their effects from governmental intrusions by unreasonable searches and seizures.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.070" offset="538739">But not all searches and seizures without warrant offend the limits imposed by the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.020" offset="566533">We submit that Illinois v. Lafayette is one such case that does not offend the limits of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.439" offset="604149">We urge this Court to find that the delayed search at the station house of the purse of the Respondent, Ralph Lafayette, after a valid custodial arrest was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.808" offset="661619">We submit to this Court that this post-arrest warrantless search was permissible both as incidental to arrest and as a valid inventory search.</text>

            <text syncTime="141.942" offset="714177">Now, Mr. Ficaro, you did not make that search incident to an arrest argument below, did you?</text>

            <text syncTime="149.377" offset="743957">Yes, Your Honor, that argument was made in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.016" offset="762451">Although in one line of the Appellate Court opinion, the Appellate Court found that it was waived, the Court went on to discuss the issue citing Ross, Belton, Sanders, Chadwick, Edwards, and then in its conclusion in the holding of the case the Court said that we find that this search is not incidental to arrest and thus violates the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.302" offset="871643">So under Jenkins v. Georgia, the Appellate Court of Illinois reached and decided the constitutional issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="219.209" offset="1023258">This only goes, as Justice O'Connor's question, only to the question of search incident to arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.816" offset="1041648">On that they say in so many words you waived that.</text>

            <text syncTime="227.002" offset="1054396">--Although they said that under Jenkins v. Georgia, they reached the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.234" offset="1075398">The question of waiver, whether or not this is an independent and adequate ground... this is not an independent ground, the issue of waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.965" offset="1114268">The Illinois courts follow procedural and substantive laws to find under the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.431" offset="1144153">In People v. Clark, in appellate courts, People v. Renke, the courts of Illinois have said that their interpretation of the Fourth Amendment is coextensive with the scope of the federal interpretation by this Court of the Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="273.687" offset="1241224">The Illinois courts follow the procedural rules, so this Court under the holdings of Steagald which establishes the standard for waiver in Illinois... the Illinois courts in People v. Keller which explicitly says we follow the federal guideline of Steagald for the waiver principles, thereby allows this Court to reach the question of whether or not it was waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.972" offset="1358357">By a clear examination of the record in this case, the issue was not waived although the Appellate Court in one simple sentence said it was waived.</text>

            <text syncTime="312.281" offset="1395555">But assuming we ought to take the word of the Illinois Appellate Court in this particular case on these particular facts as to whether something was waived under Illinois law, shouldn't we?</text>

          <turn speaker="michael_a_ficaro" startTime="360.810" stopTime="712.886">
            <label>Mr. Michael A. Ficaro</label>
            <text syncTime="360.810" offset="1589697">--I apologize to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.716" offset="1597325">I thought that was my first reference.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.684" offset="1605162">But what they have said is, in applying the principles of the Supreme Court cases, we find that this was not a search incidental to arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.602" offset="1644868">The facts of this case are that on September 1 a sergeant of the Kankakee City Police was called to a disturbance at a movie theater in Kankakee.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.018" offset="1702546">Upon his arrival he saw the Respondent at the theater having words with the theater manager.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.110" offset="1726892">As he approached the theater manager, the manager requested that the sergeant file a complaint against the Respondent, Ralph Lafayette, for disorderly conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.433" offset="1776211">Sergeant Mitzner tried to straighten out the matter there, in his own words, but the Respondent continued yelling and screaming and Sergeant Mitzner then placed him under arrest, did not search him at that time, handcuffed him, took him to his car, and brought him to the police station.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.736" offset="1849354">At the police station the Respondent was unhandcuffed and taken into the booking room where the standard police booking procedure began.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.778" offset="1897524">The Respondent was told to remove his clothing, to put on jail garb, to take the things out of his pockets, and he began filling out forms.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.338" offset="1939738">Then, according to Sergeant Mitzner, the Petitioner or the Respondent placed his purse on the counter before him, took out a pack of cigarettes.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.911" offset="1982056">The sergeant touched that purse, felt something inside and reached in.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.377" offset="2007970">According to the Petitioner, the purse was taken from his shoulder and searched.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.812" offset="2029704">But it was uncontested that inside that purse at the time... after a valid custodial arrest, were ten amphetamine pills.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.075" offset="2062722">A motion to suppress was heard, was taken under advisement by the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.884" offset="2097935">Twenty days after being taken under advisement, the state filed a brief in opposition to the motion to suppress.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.973" offset="2134298">The Appellate Court then affirmed the holding of the trial court suppressing the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.549" offset="2164600">Leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Illinois was denied, and this matter is before the Court on a writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.781" offset="2185602">The reasonableness of a post-arrest warrantless search of the Respondent's purse is predicated upon the right of the state to search the Respondent after his valid custodial arrest for disorderly conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.431" offset="2256133">The validity of Sergeant Mitzner's authority to search this individual after the arrest has remained virtually unchallenged in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.066" offset="2302735">As this Court noted in Robinson, the right to search is not to be doubted.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.360" offset="2323842">The arrest is a reasonable intrusion as this Court has said in the initial stage of prosecution which may lead to the ultimate relinquishment of liberty of this individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.026" offset="2378491">When Sergeant Mitzner observed the Respondent's disorderly conduct and arrested him for that, Ralph Lafayette's expectation of privacy in the contents of his purse became subordinated to the legitimate and overriding interests of the state to search that purse.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.440" offset="2464172">Those interests, as stated in this Court, that are monitored by police officers each day are the interests to disarm the person arrested, to protect the police officers and those around them, to remove the means of escape from the arrested person, and to prevent destruction of evidence that can be used against the person arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.478" offset="2556332">Now these interests that were monitored by Sergeant Mitzner were not tailored specifically for Ralph Lafayette.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.366" offset="2591859">These are the interests served in every arrest and search incidental thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.722" offset="2613279">The interests served are not the justification for the search of Ralph Lafayette.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.781" offset="2641596">The valid custodial arrest as this Court has indicated is the justification for that search, and the search needs no further justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.011" offset="2686526">The breadth of authority to search is not limited, as this Court has held, by the crime arrested for.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.852" offset="2721844">Despite the trivial nature of a crime that a police officer arrests an individual for, an officer never knows if he is facing the infamous, as this Court put it, trojan horse.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.486" offset="2772417">It is of no moment to a post-arrest warrantless search that there may be an absence of the fruits of the crime arrested for or no evidence of the crime that can be seized in relation to the crime, although in this case the bizarre behavior of the Respondent could have been found in the evidence of amphetamines found in his purse.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.507" offset="2876489">The Justification to search is not based upon the probability of finding weapons and evidence and means of escape in each and every case, but is based upon the valid custodial arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.564" offset="2928734">The state's interests to be protected after a valid custodial arrest are constant whether or not in a hindsight glance we can say that the interests were unlikely to have been served in that particular search incidental to arrest.</text>

            <text syncTime="738.158" offset="3099052">And the answer to that question is that the evidence of his bizarre behavior may have resulted from the use of narcotics, in this case amphetamines.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.030" offset="3138549">So in this particular case there could be established evidence of his bizarre behavior, that his yelling and screaming in a public place and acting as what is described as disorderly in this specific case.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.023" offset="3190481">It was conceded by the Respondent if Sergeant Mitzner arrested him at the movie station, he could have conducted a search contemporaneous with that arrest, but because the search was at the station, the Respondent says it violated the Fourth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3297.441" offset="13336231">I am not sure it is right to call that a hypothetical, that alternative ground, because they were subject to review by the Illinois Supreme Court which might have disagreed with them on waiver so they had a perfectly good reason for putting another reason in the record if they wanted to avoid review by their superior court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3313.653" offset="13401015">I think Your Honor brings up a good point, and that is that in the petition for leave to appeal the state did not raise the waiver question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.213" offset="13427242">In fact, they never disputed the waiver contention until the brief that they filed in this Court, and that is something that this Court noted in Tyler was significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.006" offset="13466425">With respect to this search incident to arrest question, it is our position that we must look at what Justice Frankfuter stated in United States v. Rubinowitz and that is that the exception has its basic root on need, and there was no need to conduct a search in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.855" offset="13565900">That need exists at the time of arrest as in Robinson, but once the item, the container, is secured at the station, is in custody of the police that there is no need then to conduct a search for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.835" offset="13621802">And if we just facially look at this case compared with Chadwick and Sanders, this is a stronger case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.770" offset="13645521">There is no probable cause to search in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.596" offset="13656806">There is no exigency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.111" offset="13662866">The idea that the Defendant in Sanders could have got to his suitcase was much greater than in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.468" offset="13692332">Accordingly, Your Honors, we would ask that this Court affirm the decision of the Appellate Court finding that the inventory question was rightly decided, and also we think review of the search incident to arrest question is precluded.</text>

            <text syncTime="3408.990" offset="13782402">Whether we wish to call this a search incidental to arrest or a valid inventory search, the search is based upon the validity of that arrest, and the Justification then is existent in an inventory search the same as it is in the search incidental to arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.809" offset="13861710">When Justice White addressed the question of what do we do with the wallet, if we follow the counsel's least restrictive rules test, we must ignore that there are 10 million arrests annually that involve custodial taking of a person into custody or taking him into custody.</text>

            <text syncTime="3484.225" offset="14083333">So we must balance the state's interest to search as provided for in the interest named in Opperman versus the rights of a pre-trial detainee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.596" offset="14124815">And finally as this Court has questioned the waiver issue by the state, the importance in my statement of facts and the relation to a brief being filed after the court took this matter under advisement in the trial court was that the state raised this issue of search incident to arrest eight days before the court decided this matter, and, therefore, it was timely raised in the trial court below.</text>
