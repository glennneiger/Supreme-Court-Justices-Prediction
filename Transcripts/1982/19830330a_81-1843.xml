            <label>Mr. Richard A. Devine</label>
            <text syncTime="65.254" offset="408439">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="67.832" offset="418679">The issue presented by this case is whether law enforcement officials must obtain a search warrant after a controlled delivery has been made to Respondent following a lawful customs search revealing marijuana within the container delivered.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.467" offset="481268">The essential facts are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.324" offset="492657">On February 21st, 1979, a customs agent stationed at O'Hare International Airport inspected a shipment from Calcutta, India, to Respondent consignee.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.695" offset="542185">He did this in a customs bonded area.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.147" offset="552007">The container inspected was sheet metal, approximately four feet square and 12 to 18 inches thick.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.846" offset="586803">There were two locks affixed to the container, which the customs agent opened by keys which were accompanying the airline documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.875" offset="622852">Inside the container he found a table top approximately three feet in diameter and eight to ten inches thick.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.637" offset="653885">He removed the table from the container and drilled several holes in it, removing from inside a substance, which he field tested and found to be marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.163" offset="695994">He then contacted agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.912" offset="711041">Soon thereafter DEA Agent Labek arrived at O'Hare Airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.457" offset="737163">He saw both the table and the container in the customs bonded area.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.033" offset="755554">He also performed his own field test on contents from the table top, which again showed marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.343" offset="784706">On February 22nd, the next day, DEA Agent Labek picked up the container, which had been resealed at that time, from the customs area at O'Hare.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.182" offset="832145">He was dressed as a delivery man and took the table and the container to 61 East Goethe Street in Chicago, Illinois, the address of Respondent given on the airline documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.755" offset="874359">There he met officers of the Chicago Police Department, including Police Officer Wayne Lipsek, who was also dressed as a delivery man.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.376" offset="908840">Agent Labek met an individual in the apartment building at that address who identified himself as Respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.124" offset="939874">The two walked outside and met Officer Lipsek.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.246" offset="956383">While they were unloading the container from the back of the van, Respondent noted that there was a table top inside and that he had helped pack it.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.961" offset="995253">The three carried the container into the apartment building and took it to the second floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.350" offset="1016778">Respondent directed the officers to leave the container in the hallway immediately outside his apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.785" offset="1042483">They did so.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.316" offset="1048647">After leaving the container outside the apartment, they went around the corner and observed Respondent take the container inside the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.016" offset="1083443">While Officer Lipsek left to obtain a state search warrant, Agent Labek maintained surveillance within the apartment building.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.934" offset="1119074">Soon after Respondent took the container into the apartment, Agent Labek saw him come out of the apartment, go to a window in the hallway, look to the side and look down, turn and go back into the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.396" offset="1185007">Approximately 30 to 45 minutes later, Respondent came out of the apartment with the container.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.628" offset="1217921">At that time he was arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.283" offset="1228474">Agent Labek was present at time time of the arrest and Agent Labek later testified that the container with Respondent at that time was the same container that had been delivered to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.356" offset="1276749">Officer Lipsek was radioed and told to return to the scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.650" offset="1297960">He did so, and Officer Lipsek and Agent Labek accompanied the container to Chicago police headquarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.975" offset="1331292">At Chicago police headquarters the container was opened, the table top was found within, the substance was removed from within the table top and again field tested and found to be marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.549" offset="1381552">Officer Lipsek was present during this entire process and testified that the container which was opened was the same container that had been delivered to Respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.340" offset="1432752">Respondent was charged with possession of controlled substances and with possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.257" offset="1468383">The trial court granted Respondent's motion to suppress evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.506" offset="1489385">The Illinois appellate court affirmed that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.896" offset="1498999">The State's petition for leave to appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court was denied, and this Court granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.940" offset="1527106">It is the State's position that no warrant was required for the second opening of the container at police headquarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.375" offset="1556886">There had been a lawful customs search which clearly established that contraband was within the container, and this knowledge was within law enforcement's area of understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.229" offset="1604324">There was then a controlled delivery of the container and its contents, during which the officers maintained reasonably continuous surveillance.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.584" offset="1637656">Thus the second search constituted not a new search but a reassertion of control over that which the Government had already seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.551" offset="1669526">This Court has for many years and in many cases held that a search at customs is reasonable by the fact that it occurs at the border.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.062" offset="1715606">It does not require probable cause, it does not require a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.402" offset="1732951">Thus any individual shipping a container which will cross a border has no legitimate expectation of privacy that the container will not be searched.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.602" offset="1777777">At the time that the search took place here at customs, it was performed by a customs agent, it was performed in a customs area.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.535" offset="1817483">It revealed contents which were contraband and field tests confirmed that it was contraband.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.063" offset="1851652">At that stage the Government had the right to seize the container and its contents.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.701" offset="1874221">They also had the right to conduct a controlled delivery, which they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.183" offset="1892089">A controlled delivery is an accepted police activity where there is delivery by law enforcement and there is a serving of a legitimate law enforcement purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.898" offset="1939005">In this case, two purposes could be to confirm the identity of the recipient of the container and also to identify any confederates which might be involved in the criminal enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.253" offset="1988429">Thus the seizure had taken place at the time of the initial legal search and it remained in the Government's constructive control throughout.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.687" offset="2022074">Here there was a valid controlled delivery.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.655" offset="2033986">Markings were not necessary on this container because it was of a distinctive type.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.870" offset="2054884">It was a four by four metal container used for shipping, used to ship large objects.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.211" offset="2080171">Therefore it was sufficiently distinctive that no special markings on the outside or in the interior were necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.036" offset="2111518">The law enforcement agencies involved had collective knowledge that was sufficient through the continuum of delivery here so that there was no break.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.656" offset="2158016">All relevant actions taken from the time of the search at customs were by customs agents, Chicago police department officers, or agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.981" offset="2203260">The critical point here is the 30 to 45-minute interval during which Respondent had the container in his apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.148" offset="2239936">It is our position that this did not create any legitimate expectation of privacy on the part of Respondent in the contents of the container.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.847" offset="2278806">The fact of possession clearly does not defeat a controlled delivery, because it takes place in almost every controlled delivery.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.627" offset="2309839">At least for some point, the individual recipient does have the package.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.843" offset="2330737">Constant observation of the package and the recipient are not required in a controlled delivery.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.169" offset="2356024">Quite frequently during this process, there is transfer from one agent to another, law enforcement agency to another, by a common carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.180" offset="2392073">It is not required and it has never been required in these cases that there be continuous Government observation of the object while it is being transferred.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="571.160" offset="2431988">In this case would your analysis be any different had it been a small suitcase?</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard A. Devine</label>
            <text syncTime="576.377" offset="2452886">I think, Your Honor, the situation might be different if you had a common suitcase which could not be clearly identified and which would allow readily easy transfer of the contents.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.996" offset="2523312">We submit, however, that when you have a container which is clearly identified and there is reasonably continuous surveillance by law enforcement officials, with that knowledge and then a retaking after a relatively short interval, that the second taking is merely a reassertion of control.</text>

            <text syncTime="615.971" offset="2611292">I think, Your Honor, that the Court could, because of the unusual nature of the type of search which can occur at customs under the law and which can give law enforcement officials specific knowledge of the contents of the container, could take the position that once the Government finds contraband in such containers and the container is identified, even if it were a suitcase, were clearly identifiable, then Government, if it maintained reasonably continuous surveillance, could retake that container and open it up because there had been that specific knowledge and there had not been a legitimate expectation of privacy about the contents in placing it at an international border.</text>

            <text syncTime="662.685" offset="2798120">That would be true, following up in Justice Blackmun's question, only so long as there were probable cause to believe that whatever had been in the container was still in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.978" offset="2843260">If it had been in the guy's apartment for two days and he comes out with a container, he may just be throwing it in the trash.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard A. Devine</label>
            <text syncTime="680.412" offset="2869069">I think that the time factor, Justice Rehnquist, plus the type of container are items to consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.675" offset="2894042">But I think the basic standard which the Court could look at is one that is premised on the actual knowledge at customs.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.533" offset="2921523">Of course, if it were a container that could easily be changed and were in the specific control of Respondent for a long period of time, those are considerations which the Court would have to apply to the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="738.093" offset="3099782">Here both Chadwick and Sanders, which were cases cited by the Illinois appellate court in ruling on this matter, both noted that a reasonable expectation of privacy relates to what is known about the container.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.117" offset="3167805">Chadwick specifically refers to the fact that the container itself is known to the public and can be seen by the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.597" offset="3197794">Here law enforcement had seen the contents of the container.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.987" offset="3215348">In the Sanders decision it was noted that certain types of containers, such as gun cases, do not create a reasonable expectation of privacy because of their nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.185" offset="3260070">If that is true with a gun case where the contents are not known, it is certainly true of a situation such as this, where law enforcement has with validity gone into the container in a reasonable way and determined what the contents are.</text>

            <text syncTime="1263.460" offset="5201176">They don't specifically say you can drill inside, but they do give customs the clear power to search any baggage and any person that comes in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.517" offset="5245480">Now, that has to be done reasonably, I would suggest, and that to just bash open any piece of baggage that came through, as this Court perhaps noted in Ramsey, is not something which the Court has approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.684" offset="5302114">But this was done reasonably.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.152" offset="5307965">Drills were used which customs agents apparently frequently use.</text>

            <text syncTime="1311.799" offset="5394587">So I think it is historically and under the case law quite well established that customs can do what is necessary to make a reasonable inspection.</text>

            <text syncTime="1328.168" offset="5459998">Rather, we are arguing that the customs exception quite clearly applies here and that after that inspection at customs had reveal contraband within the table top and it was placed back in the container, law enforcement could carry out a controlled delivery of that container by maintaining reasonably continuous surveillance, and under all the circumstances that have been described here allow for a second search, which is not a new search but rather a reassertion of control by Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.122" offset="5599910">This Court has in other contexts, such as Edwards and Tyler, noted that constant possession, constant visual surveillance of an area searched, is not necessary in order to retain the custody that is sufficient to allow Government to go in.</text>

            <label>Mr. Patrick G. Reardon</label>
            <text syncTime="3049.254" offset="12344412">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.378" offset="12352876">In the remaining moments, I would like once again, if I may, to address the question of Justice O'Connor's as to the time lapse, the short time lapse after the closing of the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.483" offset="12401255">I think perhaps a review of the Petitioner's reasoning that they urge us to accept relating to the expectation of privacy may help us in this area, and that is, the Petitioner urges us that there is no expectation of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.148" offset="12471994">We have urged that there is and that the Respondent at the point that he closed the door to his apartment stood in the same position relative to an expectation of privacy as Mr. Katz did in Katz versus United States when he closed the door to that telephone booth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.515" offset="12549421">The Court said in that case that up until the moment that Mr. Katz entered that phone booth there was no expectation of privacy that he could have in that booth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.714" offset="12594247">But when he went in, closed the door and paid his dime, the Government could not enter, and it was at that moment that the Government could no longer violate that expectation of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.632" offset="12637924">I suggest that John Andreas at the time he took the closed opaque container from the Government agents and rolled it into the closed door of his own apartment, that at that moment he manifested the expectation of privacy and that it wouldn't matter from that moment on how long we talk about or whether there's a short time gap or a long time gap, because at that moment the Government does not have control, there is no longer any exception that they can claim to the otherwise always supreme warrant requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.398" offset="12777000">And on that basis I hope my answer at least clarifies it, whether or not it is acceptable to all members.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="3165.083" offset="12807720">Well, having observed him putting some contraband drugs into the apartment in an identifiable package and then 30 minutes later seeing him take that same package out, was there reasonable grounds to believe that there might be drugs in the package that he carried out?</text>

            <label>Mr. Patrick G. Reardon</label>
            <text syncTime="3191.182" offset="12912105">I think it's possible to make an argument that there's probable cause at that point in fact for believing that there may be some contraband in that package, based on earlier knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.881" offset="12958917">The Illinois court said that that's a possible argument, but it doesn't apply here because probable cause does not excuse the warrant requirement as long as there is no controlled delivery in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.623" offset="13013879">We go back to the standard of Chadwick and Sanders, and in this situation that standard is that a warrant is required absent exigent circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.542" offset="13053585">It is our position that this is not a controlled delivery case, the facts do not demonstrate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.743" offset="13078349">And so to begin to elaborate as to how much control or how little, this purely and simply is not a controlled delivery case, and in that setting the Government or the State of Illinois relies on an improper premise in asking us to excuse the otherwise necessary warrant.</text>

            <text syncTime="3252.891" offset="13158910">Well, it certainly could fit the definition of a controlled delivery under any view, couldn't it, until the arrival at the apartment?</text>

            <text syncTime="3263.043" offset="13199557">We have alleged that there are two reasons for the loss of control.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.402" offset="13212932">There is certainly the loss of control at the door of the apartment, but we have alleged an earlier reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.103" offset="13235815">The State never did establish that on February 22nd, when Agent Labek went to the customs depot, that he had any direct knowledge of what was inside the package that he told us was closed and opaque at the time he picked it up on February 22nd.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.299" offset="13300599">So there really is a gap from February 21st at some point during the day up until the search the following evening of the 22nd at the police station.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard A. Devine</label>
            <text syncTime="3419.043" offset="13823570">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.119" offset="13843841">I'd just like to respond to two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.118" offset="13859828">With regard to the earlier so-called interval in the controlled delivery, the only point really that Respondent is making is that Agent Labek was not present watching the container at the time that the customs agent picked up the table top and put it back in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.156" offset="13932030">The container was resealed and remained in a customs bonded area, from which Agent Labek picked it up the next morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.404" offset="13972990">He had, as we have noted, seen that table top, seen that container the prior day, in fact tested the substance from the table top.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.134" offset="14007890">To impose the kind of standard of continuity by one individual in law enforcement to justify a controlled delivery, as Respondent would, would in effect remove controlled deliveries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.456" offset="14061180">It's a totally absurd standard, I think is the only way to really characterize it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.906" offset="14086989">The second point is that Respondent refers to Katz and going into the telephone booth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.278" offset="14116455">Well, the man going into the telephone booth did not bring a container with him which had been inspected and which had shown that the contents were contraband.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.025" offset="14151459">The only reason at all that there was any added factor here by going into the apartment was under Payton principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.115" offset="14187821">There was nothing about the container or the contents that required the police to go for a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.988" offset="14211332">It was the location of that container in the apartment which the police, in exercising professional judgment and acting as we would want them to act, sought a warrant to enter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.013" offset="14259397">It had nothing to do with the container, the contents, or anything that might have happened to either the container or the contents.</text>
