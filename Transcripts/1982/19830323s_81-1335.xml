            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="10.947" offset="136086">This case is here on certiorari to the Federal Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.729" offset="167120">I say Federal Court of Appeals to distinguish that Court from the local Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia which is the top court of the district judiciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.229" offset="221141">The District of Columbia requires an applicant for admission to the District of Columbia Bar to be a graduate of a law school approved by the American Bar Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.587" offset="278610">And neither the respondents in this case, who are applicant's for admission to the District of Columbia Bar, was graduated from an approved law school and the local District of Columbia Court of Appeals which has the last word on bar admissions in the district, denied the respondent's petitions for waiver of the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.880" offset="383727">Respondents then filed this suit in the United States District Court against the local District of Columbia Court of Appeals, challenging the denial of the waivers and also challenging the constitutionality of the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.470" offset="450183">The District Court dismissed the suit on the ground that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.694" offset="479022">And the Federal Court of Appeals Court of Appeals reversed that dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.524" offset="498352">We in turn vacate the judgment of the Federal Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.424" offset="517996">We hold that the United States District Courts have no jurisdiction over challenges to state court decisions and for this purpose, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia is treated like a state court in particular cases arising out of judicial proceedings even if those challenges alleged that the state court's action was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.215" offset="613082">Review of those decisions maybe had only in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.457" offset="634085">Thus, to the extent that the respondent sought review in the District Court of the local District of Columbia Court of Appeals' denial of the waivers, they had no -- the District Court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over their complaints.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.813" offset="707541">But United States district courts do have subject-matter jurisdiction over general challenges to state bar rules promulgated by state courts in nonjudicial proceedings, which do not require review of a final state-court judgment in a particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.352" offset="781624">Accordingly, here the District Court did have jurisdiction over the elements of respondents' complaints involving a general attack on the constitutionality of the District of Columbia rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.161" offset="832929">The judgment of the Federal Court of Appeals is therefore vacated.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.852" offset="847662">And the case remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with the opinion we have filed today with the clerk.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.186" offset="877023">Justice Stevens dissents and has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
