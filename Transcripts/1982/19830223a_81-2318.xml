            <text syncTime="86.028" offset="479418">The issue before the Court today is whether the search of the San Rafael was authorized pursuant to an exception to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.318" offset="532603">The facts in this case are relatively simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.425" offset="544933">On September 18, 1977, Officer Soli and Officer Walker, both Marine Patrol officers with the Florida Marine Patrol were traveling along near Sugarloaf Key which is close to Key West.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.808" offset="606477">They were on their way back.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.857" offset="610657">Their tour of duty had almost ended and they were returning to port when they came upon the San Rafael.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.664" offset="641900">Within 50 feet of the boat they put their spotlight on the boat, and approaching the boat identified themselves as Marine Patrol officers and asked, at that point, if they could see the registration papers or the registration certificate for the boat which is required pursuant to Florida statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.608" offset="725700">At that point, two individuals who had departed the cabin area came to the side of the boat and produced papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.748" offset="762272">Those papers did not comport with the statute requirement, but rather, were documentation papers of unspecified nature, and tax receipts reflecting the purchase of the boat.</text>

            <text syncTime="252.252" offset="1144286">Once there was no response by the defendants for the certification papers, Officer Soli, because of the bobbing of the boats, asked if she could board the boat.</text>

            <text syncTime="885.617" offset="3677746">--Your Honor, I don't know... I cannot pretend to understand what you would draw from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.900" offset="3694882">What I would draw from that is that they just did not appreciate the impact that those cases... and their applicability to this particular instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.676" offset="3729991">Because again, the nature of the case... it came up to the Florida Supreme Court on certiorari review, conflict certiorari review, regarding the initial stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.765" offset="3770324">The subsequent search, which became the subject matter for grounds before this Court, was a secondary issue that they fortuitously resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.431" offset="3808985">Once the officers were onboard... or Officer Soli was onboard the boat, at that point Officer Soli asked if they could check the ice hold that was in the front of the boat.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.519" offset="3869380">Garcia indicated that... do you have a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.658" offset="3889965">Officer Soli said I'd like to check for fish products.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.734" offset="3902190">He says, do you have a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.343" offset="3912639">At that point, Officer Walker testified in the suppression hearing and at the trial that, we do not need a warrant; we are not going to search, you're under arrest for failing to have certificate papers, your registration papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.916" offset="3978990">At that point, no time went by, based on everybody's testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.399" offset="4000829">Garcia says, you got me, in essence, there's marijuana all over the boat.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.052" offset="4019532">At that point, Miranda warnings were given, the officers asked him to reconfirm what he said.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.909" offset="4038967">He said there's marijuana on the boat.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.329" offset="4044610">At that point, Officer Walker asked if they would accompany Officer Soli to the ice hold, at which point the top or the lid was removed and marijuana... the aroma of marijuana was everywhere and apparently, leaf materials... it was just filled to the gills with marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.589" offset="4129664">The state contends that the minority opinion by the Florida Supreme Court that the case was instant to a lawful arrest, that it was a probable cause search and that, indeed, indeed, the search of the ice hold would have been justified pursuant to an inspection type check, all justified the search, and that the Florida Supreme Court was incorrect in finding that there was no consent and no probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.122" offset="4251813">I think a review of the decisions concerning consent... and I think the reason I am going to consent is that although the state never specifically argued that consent was given to search the ice hold, even though there was this kind of open statement like there's marijuana all over the boat, the state would contend that the fact that somebody's in custody, that they're not able to leave... the totality of the circumstances must be reviewed, and in this particular instance the consent was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.031" offset="4391411">But more importantly, the statement that was given was not coerced in any way, fashion or form.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.295" offset="4412414">And, therefore, there was sufficient... at that point, when the officer heard that Garcia said there is marijuana all over the boat, it developed the requisite probable cause to conduct the search of the entire boat, as this Court has suggested in Ross.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.929" offset="4475003">More importantly, as soon as Garcia and Mr. Casal were under arrest, the search instant to a lawful arrest was appropriate under Belton.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.393" offset="4512829">We're talking about a vessel which is no different than the automobile and certainly, the area that was to be searched was not a private sector of the boat, it was not someone's locker on the boat; it was a fish hold that... there are federal district court cases that have held that even the fish hold is not a private sector; it's open to the public and does not contain privacy protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.836" offset="4610631">Based on these three arguments, the state would contend that the Florida Supreme Court erred in determining that the particular search herein was unlawful.</text>

            <text syncTime="1458.145" offset="5967849">We're attacking the... or, we're supporting the decision of the Supreme Court of Florida on these grounds, based primarily upon the Langley struck doctrine, the decision by Justice Cardozo in the Mauley Construction and Maryland Casualty case, as well as Gresman Supreme Court Practice, 477, 479.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.966" offset="6067114">The state, in its presentation of the facts of the case, I believe there should be some additions to it in order that the total picture can be appreciated in deciding this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.785" offset="6158438">Is that to begin with, this was off of Sugarloaf Key, is that... I don't know if you Justices are familiar with the Keys, but Sugarloaf is between Marathon and Key West, and it's a rather remote area of the Florida Keys and it was approximately three miles offshore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.340" offset="6220610">It was about 1:00 o'clock in the morning and the seas were rough.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.790" offset="6246419">The evidence was that the Marine Patrol had a suspicion that there was lobster being stolen from fishermen's traps in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.036" offset="6283408">Further was the evidence that they had no reason for suspicion of any kind that the defendants were involved in any type of illegal activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.485" offset="6329175">As a matter of fact, both of the Marine Patrol officers said that when they approached the vessel they had no knowledge or suspicion of any kind that these men were transgressors of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.072" offset="6391555">Nevertheless, they decided to stop the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.478" offset="6409214">The vessel at this time was approximately three miles offshore, the seas were very rough and they approached the vessel from the stern, and then threw the floodlight on when they were approximately 50 feet away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.973" offset="6455189">One of the officers asked the pilot of the San Rafael to take the vessel out of gear and to bring it to a stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.359" offset="6504717">Of course, it's bring it to a stop as best you can considering the roughness of the sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.358" offset="6524675">When a vessel is brought... is taken out of gear when the seas are rough, it has a tendency to be be thrown in the direction that the sea wishes it to be thrown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.756" offset="6570337">Is that you lose control of a vessel when you take it out of gear in heavy seas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.020" offset="6591340">The record indicates that the Marine Patrol boat was pulled up alongside of the San Rafael and that the two vessels were pounding together in the heavy sea while the Marine Patrol officer questioned the men onboard if they had their registration papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.749" offset="6666259">I believe at this juncture it should be pointed out that as far as the registration law, is that Florida has its registration law for power boats, motor boats as they're called.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.772" offset="6722370">Most states have their own individual laws for registering motor boats.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.319" offset="6748597">It used to be that the federal government had the exclusive right in this area, but then they delegated this to the states and permitted the states to pass their own registration laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.658" offset="6785900">Florida passed it, and by definition under the Act, is that they state that all motor boats... and I believe this has application to an inquiry by you, Justice Powell, is that all motor boats must be registered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.570" offset="6865521">But then what they do is they say that the following vessels are not to be considered as motor boats under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.785" offset="6906376">They talk about boats strictly used for racing, they talk about other vessels from other states where they are properly registered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.764" offset="6966353">And more importantly, they say documented vessels are not labeled as motor boats, and they don't have to have registration papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.573" offset="7001566">The evidence was at this point that the defendants produced the documentation papers for the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.615" offset="7049736">And even though the documentation papers were produced clearly indicating to the police officers that registration papers were not necessary, they insisted upon the registration papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.204" offset="7104071">Officer Soli then requested permission to get aboard, and at this time the boats are still pounding together in the heavy seas, and there's no indication inside of the record that permission was ever granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.543" offset="7161436">All it is is that she proceeded to get aboard and was given assistance while getting aboard by the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.477" offset="7189230">Once aboard, she immediately engaged in a search of the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.863" offset="7218696">Is that she states that the purpose of going onboard... her true purpose in going onboard was to find seafood products.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.375" offset="7260806">The Florida statute on point 370.021 specifically states that there must be reason to believe that the conservation law has been violated in order for the Marine Patrol officer to conduct a search of a vessel in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.304" offset="7344502">So in violation of that section of the Florida statute, she nevertheless proceeded to try and search the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.097" offset="7391627">The first area she went into was the wheelhouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.313" offset="7404584">The record indicates that she followed the men into the wheelhouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.813" offset="7422556">She didn't receive any consent to go into the wheelhouse; she just went into it from the cockpit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.747" offset="7438229">She then went into the grocery box, and she wasn't looking for the registration papers when she went into the grocery box.</text>
