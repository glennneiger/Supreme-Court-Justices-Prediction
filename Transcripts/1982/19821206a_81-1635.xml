            <text syncTime="12.120" offset="200101">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case involves the constitutionality of Ohio's early filing deadline for independent candidates as that provision is applied to independent Presidential candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.361" offset="265093">The statute requires all independent candidates seeking ballot access in November to file a declaration of candidacy and 5,000 petition signatures of Ohio registered voters at least 75 days before Ohio's early June primary, which in 1980 was March 20th.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.181" offset="348372">Primary partisan candidates seeking to run in the primaries, party primaries, also must file by this same date, but partisan Presidential candidates need not file for or run in Ohio's Presidential primaries in order to get on the ballot in November.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.128" offset="424231">Under Ohio law, both minor party and major party candidates, if selected by their parties some time before late August, will appear on Ohio's ballot regardless of whether those candidates were declared candidates in March or April or May, regardless of whether they ran in Ohio's primary or any other primary, regardless of whether they came into Ohio or did anything in Ohio prior to August.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.506" offset="529662">Now, in the winter and spring of 1980, Congressman John Anderson was a Republican candidate for the nomination of the Republican Party as President of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.878" offset="579190">When it became clear that his support was coming not so much from Republican Party regulars as from more or less equally Republicans, Democrats, and independents, on April 24, 1980, he announced that he was abandoning his Republican quest and would seek to become an independent candidate nationwide.</text>

            <text syncTime="135.302" offset="692875">That same day, April 24, he also notified the Respondent in this case, the Secretary of State, that he was timely withdrawing from the Republican primary in Ohio, in which he was entered, and the state has stipulated and conceded from the beginning of this lawsuit that Anderson's timely withdrawal from the Republican primary in Ohio means that he was not barred from getting on the general election ballot by Ohio's so-called sore loser statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="173.599" offset="846057">In this case, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think it makes any difference, because the Ohio legislature has already made a judgment about whether that would disqualify a person in Mr. Anderson's position from getting on the general election ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.029" offset="915751">That judgment is reflected in its sore loser statute, 3513.04, which provides in substance that someone who loses the primary, party primary, cannot thereafter run as an independent, and in a specific withdrawal statute providing... that applies specifically to Presidential primary candidates, that holds that a Presidential candidate who withdraws from a Presidential primary is entitled to do that within 30 days of the party primary, which would be early May, and the state has stipulated that by virtue of that timely withdrawal, the sore loser ban didn't apply to him.</text>

            <text syncTime="237.589" offset="1102057">Yes, but that person would have had to have filed or made his intentions to run in the primary known before his withdrawal.</text>

            <text syncTime="256.896" offset="1179275">I think the point is that the sore loser statute, that is, the statute that directs itself to the question of whether a candidate has previously sought to gain the party nomination is... expresses a very different state interest than the filing deadline, and the filing deadline is a much more burdensome provision, because it bars all independent candidates and all independent-minded voters after March 20 from putting forward an independent candidate, whereas the sore loser provision applies only to individual candidates, and doesn't bar the voters from putting forward another independent until some time very late in the summer.</text>

            <text syncTime="391.260" offset="1716666">Justice O'Connor, I think the Court has recognized in the past, for example, in Lubin and Panish, that the write-in... and in Williams and Rhodes, that the write-in alternative is not an equivalent, a practical equivalent either for voters or for candidates to having a candidate's name on the ballot, and I would contend that that is particularly so for someone seeking as important an office as President of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.377" offset="1829201">I think the reason for that is that the write-in alternative and the ballot access alternative serve very different purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.278" offset="1864832">The state is saying to a candidate and to his or her supporters, if you can demonstrate substantial community support, you are entitled to have your name printed on the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.678" offset="1910390">Perhaps the major party candidates get some ballot preference, but the independent's or third party candidate's name will be on the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.177" offset="1940378">The state is also saying by the write-in alternative, we are not going to totally bar everyone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.815" offset="1970889">In other words, regardless of whether you have any community support, we will allow people to write your name in if you simply go through some administrative... jump through some administrative hoops near to the election.</text>

            <text syncTime="523.490" offset="2245593">I think it does, but I think the voters also have an independent right.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.174" offset="2260326">The voters' rights that are being infringed here are the rights of independents and other voters to have the opportunity during this five-month period when party supporters have an opportunity to react to political events and other candidates' choices, and in late August to be able to choose that candidate who is going to have the best chance to win.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.148" offset="2364293">It is the discrimination between the rights of those voters to put forward a candidate, the party and the independents.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.019" offset="2403791">Now, the state says that is really very theoretical, but I think that you can take any of the examples that we have cited in our brief from political history and demonstrate that the same thing could happen in 1984, that would discriminate against the independent voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.763" offset="2470769">For example, in 1968, Lyndon Johnson shocked the country by announcing in late March that he was not going to run for re-election, and indeed his principal opponent at that time, Senator Robert Kennedy, who had only declared two weeks earlier, was assassinated in early June.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.816" offset="2546942">Those events totally changed the political calculus.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.768" offset="2558749">Now, given our present economic situation and the age of our incumbent President, it would be no more shocking if President Reagan were to announce on April 24, 1984, that he had decided not to run for re-election.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.483" offset="2613606">If that happened, party voters and party supporters would have months to react and still choose in late August the best candidate based on that set of political circumstances, but what about voters who elected President Reagan in 1980 because of, say, his views on supply side economics, his conservative political ideology?</text>
            <text syncTime="637.647" offset="2702213">Those people who assumed on March 20, 1984, that their interests would be represented in the general election, because they would vote for President Reagan for re-election, now, if the Republican Party were not going to nominate someone who met their political views, they would be forever frozen.</text>

            <text syncTime="677.348" offset="2861038">It is not possible to tell prior to early summer in many election years who the most likely candidates are going to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.407" offset="2897296">Therefore, there is no meaningful or realistic incentive for voters to organize behind an independent candidate very early in the year and find somebody who is going to expend the necessary energy to go out there in January and February and March with volunteers in 50 states and get on the ballot.</text>

            <text syncTime="734.465" offset="3089557">Justice Rehnquist, I don't think that is at all the necessary logic of our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.261" offset="3116724">Our position is only that the state should not be permitted to very substantially burden and discriminate against independents by making them qualify much earlier than the party candidates absent some state interest that the legislature, state legislature has considered and made a determined judgment it is really necessary to impose this burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.748" offset="3210661">For example, administrative interests of the state of Ohio on the face of its statute might well sustain a filing deadline here in early June, several months in advance of the party conventions, and indeed this Court has sustained mid-June deadlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.930" offset="3279415">So we are not arguing that independents have to be given the right to come after the party selections.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joel S. Taylor</label>
            <text syncTime="1601.749" offset="6558618">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the Ohio filing deadline at issue in this case has a burden, if it has one at all, of an entirely different character than the election regulations that have been struck down in the past by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.166" offset="6632284">It does not result in a prohibition of all independent candidacies from the Ohio ballot, nor does it make it virtually impossible for third party candidacies, as was the case in Williams v. Rhodes, nor does this filing deadline result in any class of voters being totally prohibited from voting at all, as was the case in Dunn against Blumstein, the Tennessee one-year residency case, and Kramer against Union Free School District, where classes of voters were prohibited from voting at all in a particular election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.775" offset="6778778">The burden of this statute is indeed even less than the burden posed by statutes which have been upheld by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.195" offset="6820470">For example, this filing deadline does not require the voter to make up his mind as long as eleven months before an election how he wishes to participate in that election, as was the case in Rosario against Rockefeller, in which a party enrollment statute in New York was upheld that required enrollment as long as eleven months before a primary election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.324" offset="6908973">Nor does this statute require the candidate to make up his mind as to how he wishes to participate in an election as long as one year before that election, as was the case in Storer v. Rhodes, in which a one-year disaffiliation requirement was upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.928" offset="6975428">Indeed, all this statute requires is that a person seeking the office of President, an office for which the campaigns frequently begin as long as two years before the election, make up his mind seven and a half months before that election that he wishes to seek the office as an independent candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.077" offset="7055990">This, I would submit, is not much of a burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.104" offset="7076052">I would like to stress three areas in my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.196" offset="7088486">Number one, that there is no invidious discrimination in this case between independent candidates and the candidates of political parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.022" offset="7127774">Number two, the statute does not pose a substantial burden upon any constitutional rights for the class of independent candidates, and therefore strict scrutiny is not appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.109" offset="7172078">And Number three, it is in fact supported by important state interests.</text>

            <text syncTime="1783.755" offset="7286703">The... Any restriction on a candidacy is going to have an effect on voters to the extent that if the candidate does not comply with that restriction, whatever it is, then his supporters will have one less candidate available to vote for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.498" offset="7345635">In other words, any candidate restriction is going to narrow the field to some extent that the voter has available to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.557" offset="7373848">The Court has never held that that simple narrowing of the field all by itself is enough to establish an infringement of rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.899" offset="7403314">Indeed, in Bullock v. Carter which... in which the issue was discussed extensively, the Court in that case relied upon a factual determination that indeed many, many candidates had been kept off the ballot by the high filing fees in the state of Texas that were not sustained in that case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1939.205" offset="7908522">So that it would appear that at least seven states are desirous of having a filing deadline at or about this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.484" offset="7941645">There are, of course, many other filing deadlines in June and July that would come much earlier than the second of the two national conventions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1985.156" offset="8092320">So that I think the impact of this case would be much, much broader than simply a filing deadline that occurs in the spring.</text>

            <text syncTime="2018.267" offset="8224708">There is a fundamental fallacy in making this argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="2230.881" offset="9075151">At the point in time in March then when those two entities have qualified for the ballot, the difference between the independent candidate and the political party is simply that the political party has not yet named the person who is going to carry its banner, and the reason for that goes to the fundamental nature of the differences between political parties and independent candidacies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.997" offset="9167624">The independent candidacy is a candidacy by definition built around a single individual who is running on his ideas, his principles, and his beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.116" offset="9208166">The political party obviously has a much broader existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.242" offset="9224675">It has principles beyond those of the individual person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.849" offset="9239095">It has a continuing program of electing officials that extends beyond a particular election, and it is because of these organizational differences between the political party and the independent candidate that the process for selecting the person who is going to carry the political party banner is more complicated than it is for the independent candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.902" offset="9323314">By definition, the party must pick and choose its candidate, and it does that through the system of primaries and conventions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.057" offset="9363856">This Court considered whether or not the differences, those kinds of differences between political parties and independent candidates might violate the equal protection clause in Jeness against Fortson, in which a claim was in fact made by an independent candidate that there was invidious discrimination because he did in fact have to file his petitions and qualify for the ballot that way, whereas the political party candidate could qualify by winning the primary at some later point in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.746" offset="9494677">The Court in rejecting that claim indicated that these were simply two different types of procedures, and that it is not possible to compare political parties and independent candidates for all purposes, and indeed, that the grossest discrimination can sometimes lie in treating things that are different as though they were the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.409" offset="9569283">And with respect to the Fourteenth Amendment issue in this case, Ohio's position is that it is simply not appropriate to compare those two very different routes to the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.313" offset="9612960">However, even accepting the premise offered by Petitioner for the moment, and assuming that one can make an attempt to compare the individuals who seek political party nomination with the independent candidates, we still believe no invidious discrimination can be shown, and that is for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.663" offset="9706373">The independent candidates are required to file for the ballot on the same date in March as those party candidates who are seeking delegates to the national conventions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.112" offset="9752140">The burden posed on each is the same or arguably even more burdensome for the party candidate, and I should add here that it is indeed clear in Ohio that it is the party candidate who is seeking these delegates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.399" offset="9809296">It is the party candidate's name who goes on the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.930" offset="9819431">He must give his written consent to all the delegates that file petitions on his behalf, and indeed, he even has the right to determine the order in which delegates are selected.</text>

            <text syncTime="2918.937" offset="11827412">The political commentators who have written on this subject in the last two or three years, and we cite six of them on Page 28 of our brief, are unanimous in their declaration that a fundamental change occurred after the 1968 Presidential election such that we switched from basically a brokered convention system to a system that results in the nominees of the parties being selected through the primaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.676" offset="11934409">And those commentators are unanimous in their view that any party candidate who wishes to seek the nomination, if he is serious about it at all, has to go after it in this day and age in the primary, and that means in turn that the candidate has to be seeking delegates to the convention through the primary election system, so that the party candidates in Ohio are going to be in there filing their petitions and making their decision to go for office at the same time as the independent candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.210" offset="12064499">I think it is a myth to talk about candidates arising as late as August with one possible exception, and that is if you've got an extreme situation like the death of a candidate or a sudden withdrawal, but most of the time, indeed probably more than 90 percent of the time, we are going to have a situation where the people that want this... the office of President are in there at the same time in Ohio fighting for it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3322.930" offset="13443346">He withdrew from the ballot under a Section 3513.30 that specifically allows Presidential candidates to withdraw from the ballot up to 30 days before the deadline.</text>

            <text syncTime="3347.528" offset="13541776">The reason for it was to avoid what would otherwise be the applicability of Ohio's so-called sore loser statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.007" offset="13571660">The Petitioner is simply incorrect in this contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.837" offset="13587020">If we look at the legislative history for Section 3513.30, which was enacted in House Bill 1245 in 1976, a bill that dealt only with this subject, we find that that bill became effective in April, right before the primary date.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.156" offset="13664342">It was enacted as an emergency measure to get it immediately effective under Ohio law, which requires a higher vote than a normal bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.855" offset="13699138">The reason stated for the bill in that emergency clause was to spare the voters of Ohio the confusion of having on the ballot the names of persons who no longer wished to be candidates, and the expense of counting ballots for such persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.427" offset="13757338">So, indeed, that statute did not have anything to do with avoiding the sore loser provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.286" offset="13776773">The sore loser provision has been stipulated to be inapplicable in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.721" offset="13794537">It may or may not be inapplicable because of the fact that there was a withdrawal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.267" offset="13812718">It is clearly inapplicable because by the terms of the statute itself, it does not apply in the Presidential election, as the Sixth Circuit noted in Footnote 3 of its opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="3460.919" offset="13995366">I don't think it's just the 6 percent of the electorate that voted for Congressman Anderson in the November election whose rights are burdened here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3511.631" offset="14198181">The burden isn't just a burden that narrows the range of candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.507" offset="14213750">It would have not only disqualified these people from voting for Congressman Anderson, but from putting forward any independent candidate after March 20.</text>

            <text syncTime="3531.967" offset="14279578">Since 1948, however, three former Presidents, a former Vice President, at least two former Senators, a former Governor, a former Congressman have run for President as third party candidates or independent candidates.</text>

            <text syncTime="3555.551" offset="14373828">They haven't won, and I think that demonstrates that the practical and political barriers to independent candidates are very significant by themselves, and they include the efforts that an independent has to go through to get on the ballot in 50 different states under 50 different sets of laws which customarily have exhausted that candidate in ballot access activities rather than campaigning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.353" offset="14469123">The proposition of our case is, those burdens are high enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.037" offset="14487826">The state should not be permitted discriminatorily, without a considered state interest, from adding additional handicaps to the independent or the third party candidate without the legislative judgment that that burden--</text>
