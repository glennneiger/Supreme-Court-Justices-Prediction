            <text syncTime="114.248" offset="614720">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I shall argue first as a friend of the Court on the issue of standards for granting stays of execution on denials of petitions for writ of habeas corpus in capital case, and Mr. Gray shall argue for the Petitioner on the merits of the case with regard to the admissibility of the psychiatric testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.146" offset="714299">I would first like to commence with a brief review of the chronology of the case, because it bears upon an important issue with regard to the stay, and that is whether counsel acted diligently or dilatorily.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.824" offset="773022">The Petitioner in this case, Thomas Barefoot, was convicted in November, 1978, of homicide, and he litigated his case in the state courts on direct review, and then to this Court, and then on state post-conviction relief for approximately three years, and on October 6th, 1981, he completed his proceedings in the state system, and less... approximately a week later, on October 14th, he filed his case in the United States District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.137" offset="918263">That case was resolved a year later in the District Court on November, 1982, and on December 3rd, the District Court granted a certificate of probable cause and permission to proceed in forma pauperis, and on December 4th it vacated a stay which it had theretofore granted.</text>

            <text syncTime="217.015" offset="1025783">On December 20th, the District Court set the date of execution for January 25th, 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.572" offset="1076042">Texas has a doctrine which does not permit litigation in its state courts as long as proceedings are pending in the federal courts, and some newly discovered evidence appeared, as well as an additional state court matter, which had not been exhausted, and so Mr. Gray went back into the state courts on December 20th on state habeas corpus which was denied on December 21st.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.327" offset="1191086">However, he was not notified of this denial until January 7th.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.652" offset="1208326">A week thereafter, he filed his petition in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, on January 14th.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.508" offset="1251794">He received a telephone call on January 17th telling him to appear for a hearing on the application for stay on January 19th.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.738" offset="1280738">He appeared in court on January 19th.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.019" offset="1289828">The panel which had Judge Brown on it informed him that Judge Brown was ill and Judge Randall was substituting for Judge Brown, and it was stated in open court that Judge Randall had showed up at the last moment, didn't know anything at all about the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.761" offset="1352731">The record on the... of the state court proceedings had not yet been filed in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.026" offset="1373838">The record of the federal habeas court proceedings was just then filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.850" offset="1393169">There was a letter from counsel which was turned over to the court saying that the American Psychiatric Association desired to file a friend of the court brief on the important issue of the admissibility and the significance of the psychiatric testimony in this case, which was based upon a response to a hypothetical question.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.747" offset="1468715">The hearing on the stay was concluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.135" offset="1482299">Twenty-four hours later, a 16-page opinion was issued denying the stay and setting forth as a standard for granting a denial of stay whether or not Petitioner had established a substantial likelihood of success on the merits.</text>

            <text syncTime="365.405" offset="1619389">Well, you must be aware that, for example, one Justice of this Court for many years came on the bench without knowing anything but the name of the case, and did so deliberately.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.272" offset="1674873">You suggest that disqualifies a judge from participating?</text>

            <text syncTime="383.147" offset="1690338">No, I certainly was not suggesting it was a disqualification, but certainly it was an indication of not adequate opportunity for study and reflection on a matter that was complex and difficult.</text>

            <text syncTime="398.375" offset="1751255">The matter had been through the state court system, but Petitioner had a Congressionally mandated statutory right to federal habeas corpus review of his constitutional claims in the federal courts and had not yet had that.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.040" offset="1801933">Now, our brief and others argue that a stay should be granted on appeal from appeal from denial of a first application, I must stress, a first application for writ of habeas corpus whenever petitioner presents issue that are not frivolous or has a certificate of probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.098" offset="1866090">But there are additional reasons which we would like to submit on this argument based on policy why Petitioner's first application should receive the ordinary consideration afforded non-death sentence prisoners who assert they have been denied constitutional rights without having their cases mooted by execution.</text>

            <text syncTime="533.740" offset="2292722">These are not frivolous petitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.224" offset="2302648">I would like to just identify three policy considerations that support the statutory argument made in the various briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.329" offset="2339010">The first is the interest of the defendant to have his constitutional claims fairly considered in the same manner as the claims of an ordinary embezzler or petty thief.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.637" offset="2392300">The second is the interest of the states in maintaining an effective system of criminal justice, and the third is the interest of this Court in not only doing justice to capital defendants but the total run of business of the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.288" offset="2442873">As to the defendants in the capital cases, they are mostly represented by volunteer counsel, public defenders, a few civil rights organizations, such as the one for which I work, which has three or four lawyers working on such cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.500" offset="2503686">The cases are complex.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.187" offset="2514449">The capacity of lawyers to present them fairly and completely is now... we have now gone totally beyond that, and if the courts obtain the assistance they need, at a minimum, there should be the time for the ordinary briefing and presentation of ordinary cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.774" offset="2572859">As far as the interests of the states are concerned, there is one thing to be said for states.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.881" offset="2589264">They are interested in the administration of... fair administration of the criminal justice systems, capital punishment as a deterrent, as an appropriate attributive device.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.656" offset="2632313">I happen not to agree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.939" offset="2637538">We are required to accept.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.736" offset="2644643">The pipeline is filled.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.091" offset="2654047">Executions are occurring.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.342" offset="2663138">Anyone who picks up the papers will know that people who commit homicides are being executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.434" offset="2683513">If there is a deterrent effect arising from executions, that deterrent effect will take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.808" offset="2704934">So far as the interest of the federal judiciary is concerned, this Court and other courts have heavy dockets of many different kinds of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.879" offset="2749237">The counsel in those cases and the parties in those cases cannot have their cases fairly heard if they must operate on a crash schedule, as Mr. Gray had to operate in this case, compiling a complex record in three days, the record of the trial and the record of the habeas corpus proceeding not being presented until one before the hearing and the other after the hearing, a difficult issue requiring medical judgments, which was covered in a brief by the American Psychiatric Association, which finally was filed in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.425" offset="2887477">To compress on a crash, rush basis the consideration of the stay into the consideration of the merits, which is what, of course, happens, because otherwise the case is mooted out by the execution of the defendant before he has a hearing on the merits, does not help the federal courts, does not help criminal justice, and certainly is to the detriment of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.854" offset="2981100">We urge upon this Court a standard which is that in cases of a first application for a petition of writ of habeas corpus, that application be considered in the ordinary course of events, which may take four to six months, instead of the crash basis, which takes four to six weeks, and that the interests of... all the various interests involved will be well served and no interest involved will be deserved by such a procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="768.986" offset="3233652">At the punishment hearing, they put on evidence... well, they put that on at the punishment hearing, prior convictions for two firearm cases and three drug-related cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.903" offset="3281299">They put on testimony at the guilt stage of the trial about... at least they introduced the testimony of some charges in New Mexico involving rape and kidnapping of a child under 13.</text>

            <text syncTime="2038.334" offset="8311020">The Court has said that the imposition or the carrying out of the death penalty is different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.579" offset="8332023">The imposition of it is different also, in the rather obvious following manner which I think bears emphasis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.939" offset="8357518">No one is sentenced to be on death row, and I think we can all agree that the more than 1,100 persons now on death row represents a national tragedy, but it is a national tragedy that is exacerbated by the fact that they sit there apparently interminably while their cases are litigated year after year in the appellate courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.275" offset="8430870">I think that we can all agree that the effects of this delay are terrible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.129" offset="8450201">They erode the public faith in the judiciary, promote the view that the law cannot be carried out, destroy whatever deterrent effect the death penalty would otherwise have, makes proof of claims harder if retrials are necessary, often make retrials impossible, and I think that we also agree that the delays are very unfair to those who are unconstitutionally confined upon death row, who after interminable years on death row finally reach an adjudication that their conviction was unconstitutional in the first place, and now rehabilitation must begin of those individuals after the debilitating effects of being on death row for years.</text>

            <label>Mr. Douglas M. Becker</label>
            <text syncTime="3389.599" offset="13716173">Your Honors, I have attempted to reduce my argument upon the stay question to a syllogism.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.911" offset="13745430">First, that it is perfectly understandable why the standards for granting a certificate of probable cause and a stay pending appeal are different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.014" offset="13777822">A certificate of probable cause to the appeal involves an internal matter of federal jurisdiction with no particular concern for the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.904" offset="13809378">The granting of a stay pending an appeal involves in effect an injunction against the state court proceedings and, we argue, justifies the higher standard that has been required in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.007" offset="13849711">The standard for a certificate of probable cause is an absence of frivolity of at least one issue, and of the stay, that there be a substantial question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.536" offset="13879908">The opinion of the District Court in this case illustrates the District Court's painstaking attempt to distinguish between those issues that were frivolous, some of which were labeled as frivolous in his opinion, and others, like the psychiatric issue, at Page 12 of the joint appendix, where the District Court stated that upon careful reflection, this ground is without merit, and I think the District Court felt that if he had to give the kind of careful reflection to an issue that he had to give in this opinion, that it was not frivolous, but at the same time that he could in good faith conclude that it was not substantial, and therefore grant the state's motion to reinstitute the execution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.755" offset="14032777">Secondly, the Fifth Circuit could have simply expedited the appeal and done essentially the same things that it did do and affirm the judgment of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.298" offset="14070916">Instead, it did something that was more favorable to the Petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.936" offset="14085440">Clearly, the Fifth Circuit addressed the merits of all the issues that Petitioner raised in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.074" offset="14109995">They did so in applying the stay standard to determine whether any of those were substantial, a more favorable standard for Petitioner to prevail upon than he would have had in an expedited appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.834" offset="14153045">So, although I think they could have expedited the appeal and actually affirmed the judgment, I also think if they could have done that, plainly they could have done something that was more favorable to Petitioner, which is to consider his issues within the context of a stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.374" offset="14211246">The procedures are not precisely a way to expedite all capital cases, as was suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.402" offset="14235383">It is a manner, and there have been indeed many cases where we did not oppose stays of execution that were granted by District Courts, even though we were plainly entitled to do that in the Court of Appeals under Rule 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.352" offset="14279164">Instead, what it is is a means of deciding where an injunction is necessary in a capital case as in any other kind of case, to preserve the appellant's right to appeal, to make a preliminary evaluation of the issues that are presented, to determine whether any of them are substantial, and to determine whether further delays are appropriate even though there are no substantial issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.091" offset="14378116">And what the Court of Appeals did in this case is to decide that where there was no substantial issue after a careful examination of the merits, no further delay was appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.012" offset="14417822">I don't think that that is an unreasonable burden on the Courts of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.180" offset="14434436">It is one that they exercise all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.430" offset="14443422">I don't think the Fifth Circuits thinks it is an unreasonable burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.850" offset="14457110">The Fifth Circuit, it must be remembered, the Court of Appeals had the absolute right simply to grant the stay of execution pending appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.924" offset="14493473">They would have had to write nothing upon that point, and the state would have been out of court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.408" offset="14511340">Instead, what they did was to take on that burden and to decide the question of whether any of the issues were substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.591" offset="14540075">With respect to the issue of the hypothetical psychiatric testimony, I think that what the plaintiff does ask the Court in effect to do is to overrule Jurek, something that is obviously not before the Court, and that is the import of his argument, because in Jurek if the Court approved the future dangerousness issue as an appropriate one to decide the question of life or death, the Court also in the same breath said that all relevant evidence should be presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.126" offset="14666194">I think that Petitioner's argument that there is no room for mitigating circumstances within this context is plainly without merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.904" offset="14701303">The very criteria that Drs. Holbrook and Grigson enumerated as important to their diagnosis emphasized the kinds of things that Petitioner says he had no opportunity to present, things like family ties, and employment record, attendance at church, a stable circle of friends, and all the other things in his brief that he says could not have affected the opinion of the psychiatrists are the very things that are directly related to the loyalty to institutions that the doctors talked aboutduring their testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.544" offset="14827944">He could have impeached their testimony upon that basis and asked them if it would have been changed if any of those things existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3675.975" offset="14861590">He could have clearly put on evidence, mitigating evidence of those facts at the punishment phase in order to argue that to the jury, and he did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.550" offset="14895967">It can only be assumed that those things did not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3687.424" offset="14907461">I also will emphasize that under Texas law, the defendant can, and he does, call psychiatric witnesses in his own behalf, and although the assertion has been made--</text>
