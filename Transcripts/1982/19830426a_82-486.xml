            <text syncTime="88.933" offset="490511">As the Court of Appeals majority stated, this case grows out of an episode of mob violence at the Alligator Bayou Pumping Station construction site near Port Arthur, Texas that caused both serious injuries and substantial property damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.892" offset="590299">That wrongdoing led to this federal court suit brought by two individuals and by the general contractor at that job site and to avert it in favor of the plaintiffs and against three local unions which are the petitioners here.</text>

            <text syncTime="244.979" offset="1114733">Well, I suppose in Beaumont, Port Arthur you have got elected judges and there might be some feeling that you do not get quite the same neutrality from elected judges as you do from lifetime federal judges.</text>

          <turn speaker="laurence_gold" startTime="255.132" stopTime="581.765">
            <label>Mr. Laurence Gold</label>
            <text syncTime="255.132" offset="1155275">--There are also appellate judges in Texas up and down the system, and I can only say that there isn't a whisper in this record that the state justice system was not open to and fully protective of the rights and interests of plaintiff companies and non-union employees in the State of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.162" offset="1315458">Indeed, there were 13 indictments growing out of this episode, three convictions, two people in jail for substantial terms indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.123" offset="1387243">So in all those respects this is not your garden variety case for choosing a federal court as opposed to a state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.993" offset="1442727">The en banc majority below analyzed Section 1985(3) as requiring a showing aside from the conspiracy and acts pursuant to the conspiracy and injury are the violation of some protected right and moreover class-based invidiously discriminatory animus motivating the invasion of that right and motivating the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.274" offset="1591834">The court found that the right of economic association is such a protected right and, indeed, analyzed the matter as comprising a protected right under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.763" offset="1705832">That court rejected our contention that for 1985(3), as is generally true, to show the invasion of a First and Fourteenth Amendment right as opposed to the invasion of the rights guaranteed by the Thirteenth Amendment or the rights guaranteed by the right of travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.110" offset="1839266">There has to be a showing of state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.263" offset="1855879">That court took the view that the contention I have just outlined had been rejected in Griffin v. Breckenridge, this Court's leading modern case on the scope of Section 1985(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="453.692" offset="1949502">We cannot improve upon, and we have quoted at page 39 of our opening brief, the blue brief, the analysis of this issue by Justice Stevens in Novotny.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.526" offset="2036856">We rest on that analysis and in terms of an analysis of the statute, neither the court below nor the respondents challenge the accuracy of the insights stated there.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.439" offset="2132568">Rather both contend that that view of the statute is precluded by Griffin.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.982" offset="2170707">It is our view that Griffin simply did not address this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.384" offset="2208324">Griffin was a case involving a conspiracy aimed at black Americans attempting to assert their civil rights and those who would assist them.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.566" offset="2277078">The court analyzed the matter as resting on the Thirteenth Amendment base and the right and power of Congress to do away with the badges and incidence of slavery.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.166" offset="2351475">It is perfectly well settled that Congress in no way, shape, or form is limited by a state action requirement in those regards and that those constitutional rights, both the rights vouchsafed by the Thirteenth Amendment and the rights stated by the right of travel are protected against private interferences.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="581.765" offset="2461816">Can you think of any more rights, Mr. Gold, that would fall on that side of the line that Justice Stevens drew?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="laurence_gold" startTime="589.294" stopTime="919.801">
            <label>Mr. Laurence Gold</label>
            <text syncTime="589.294" offset="2491909">From our view of the cases, Justice Rehnquist, we know of no other constitutional rights which are, of those stated in the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendment, which do no have a state action component to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.502" offset="2588771">And it is hardly surprising that Congress would be particularly concerned about Thirteenth Amendment rights in terms of the 1871 Act because the voluminous legislative history is instinct on every page with a desire to protect the rights of the newly enfranchised freedmen and to ensure that the wrongdoing that was taking place in the South against them would have a federal remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.268" offset="2747804">At the same time, Section 2, which was the point of controversy in the 1871 Act, was shaped by the moderate Republicans in the House who were not only mindful of that major interest and concern, the one I have just outlined, but also saw an important value in maintaining a system of federalism at the time as they understood that system.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.549" offset="2897016">The debate in the House and the strong controversy that Section 2, as originally introduced, created, which has been noted by this Court in numerous decisions, concerned how to advance both these values.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.448" offset="2964516">If there had only been one value, the need to end what was seen by every segment of the majority party at that time, the Republicans, as outrages in the South, there would have been no division, no compromise, no internal controversy in the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.314" offset="3052079">But there was this understanding of the fact that there were two values and a desire to put down Klan violence without doing violence to the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments as the moderate Republicans understood those amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.493" offset="3132745">The moderates prevailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.680" offset="3141522">The Section 2 was rewritten in response to Representative Garfield's speech, which we have laid out at perhaps overly great length in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.628" offset="3197319">There is no doubt when you read the debate that Section 2 of the 1871 Act was redrafted to meet that speech and had probably been redrafted before the speech was given because it concludes with Representative Garfield saying I'm confident that language can be drafted which will meet these concerns, concerns about the federal government intruding into the proper state domain and becoming the primary guarantor of property and individual rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.814" offset="3361995">Low and behold the next day Representative Shellabarger, who was managing the bill, comes in and says here is an amendment presented by friends of this legislation to assure that we can go forward, and the amendment, by adding the terms "equal protection of the laws" and</text>
            <text syncTime="828.367" offset="3448199">"equal privileges and immunities of the laws. "</text>
            <text syncTime="830.805" offset="3458021">met precisely the lines and the concerns stated by Representative Garfield.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.987" offset="3498772">If we are right in that point, since there is not a hint of state action in this case, the decision below must be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.936" offset="3562511">But even if it is viewed, even if the statute is viewed as protecting basic constitutional rights against private conspiracy where there is no state action, we think the same result follows, because the court below was of the view that working for a non-union employer is a First Amendment right.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.330" offset="3688108">It is our understanding based on this Court's cases that the particular economic relations between employers and employees is not governed by the First Amendment but is governed by state law and Congress' power to enact legislation pursuant to the commerce clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="1156.816" offset="4762054">I was wondering about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.346" offset="4776160">I do not think that if, for example... let me try to grapple with the question in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.403" offset="4820359">If in a particular area there are no places of employment where unions have succeeded in becoming majority representatives as provided for in the National Labor Relations Act, I do not think an individual could sue anybody on the view that he was being deprived of his right to work under union conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.547" offset="4952957">On the other hand, if unions succeeded in organizing the places of employment in the locality, I do not believe that the opposite law suit would lie, either.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.665" offset="5009486">Obviously the individual has a freedom.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.647" offset="5029339">Perhaps this is the clearest I can be in answering this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.909" offset="5066433">I believe that the individual has a freedom to move from place to place and to look for employment that suits him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.906" offset="5110423">I do not believe that he has a constitutional right to demand that certain conditions obtain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.260" offset="5151801">The second element that the Court of Appeals understood to be encompassed in Section 1985(3) or at least in the aspect we are discussing here, the equal protection of the laws and equal privileges and immunities of the laws aspect of the statute, is a requirement that there be a showing of class-based invidiously discriminatory animus and that court segmented that requirement as follows:</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.194" offset="5351586">First the court stated that such animus is shown if there is animus against a class of those with common characteristics of an inherent nature and secondly, a particular application here, recognizing that there was no such class, the Court of Appeals said that the statute also encompasses conspiracies motivated by an animus of the kind Congress was trying to protect against in enacting the 1871 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.379" offset="5524307">The Court of Appeals read the legislative history of the 1871 Act to show an intent to act against conspiracies motivated by an animus against exercises of the right of economic association, which exercises of that right ignite regional hostility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.867" offset="5642276">It is our view that that dramatically overreads the statute and Congress' intent therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.239" offset="5683759">We know what the core of what Congress sought to do was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.236" offset="5711762">It was to protect the freedmen and those who were seeking to assure that the freedmen secured the rights provided by the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.195" offset="5791592">Every page of the legislative history is instinct with that intention except for scattered passages and in the very considerable legislative history debated, I might say, at a very high and intense level given the gravity of the moment, there are no other references to a congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.371" offset="5900261">In Griffin the Court left open the question of whether any intent under other than racial animus or bias supports a 1985(3) cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.615" offset="5969225">It is our position that given the fact that this is a statute stated in general terms, one can generalize from the particular concerns of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.203" offset="6035576">We would formulate the animus test as class-based animus against those who have common characteristics of an inherent nature who are offered special protection under the Equal Protection Clauses and in that sense that is the first part of what the Court of Appeals understood class-based animus to be and those who are aiding the former to secure that protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.971" offset="6162635">The area, I think, of legitimate dispute is what is one to make of the repeated references in the legislative history to the interest in protecting not only the freedmen but Republicans and Northerners and others who were also the object of the Klan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.238" offset="6299726">In the legislative materials we set out, both in our opening brief and at pages 11 to 18 of our reply brief, it seems to us apparent that the understanding at the time was that those in addition to the freedmen who were to be protected were the individuals who were seeking to assure the protections to that group of Americans guaranteed by the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.642" offset="6477359">It was not Republicans as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.345" offset="6484150">It was not the Northerners as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.858" offset="6498257">It was to those who were embarked in the enterprise of making those amendments real.</text>

            <text syncTime="1663.330" offset="6788111">Indeed, the broadest statement, that of Senator Edmunds, which is relied on, and it is wholly unique in this entire legislative history, proposes an antithesis between feuds which are generated by particular activities that individuals do not like and class-based animus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.458" offset="6896572">So my answer to your question would be that the weight of the legislative evidence is that the protection extends to classes of inherent characteristics who are the objects of discrimination and depravation--</text>

            <text syncTime="1801.867" offset="7342221">At the outset of my presentation, may I revert to the facts momentarily, and we might start with the dissent of the Fifth Circuit who called this an unprovoked and brutal attack on law-abiding citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.220" offset="7415677">The trial court in his opinion which is in the Joint Appendix stated that this arose out of a demonstration or citizen protest where people were voicing concern over outside, non-union workers in a union area much like the Vermonter, the Northerner, who was traveling to the South in Reconstruction times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.051" offset="7522988">These two statements were based on fact, and they were best capsulated by the attorney for defendant in the opening statement to the trial court when he said, and it becomes important to the legislative history, what happened here... and this is the attorney for the defendant... what happened here arises from the fact that the labor organizations are strong in this area when outside contractors come into the area employing people from outside the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.492" offset="7656735">Just as Senator Edmund in 1871 was concerned with the Northerner, the Vermonter, the Republican, the Democrat, the Methodist, the Catholic and the recently freed man, this case comes as close factually to any case that has ever been before any of the courts under 1985(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.998" offset="7762792">In Griffin the Court set out four elements, and if I may respectfully refer to them as the Court did and gave them a separate number.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.228" offset="7807723">One, that the defendants conspired, and there was a conspiracy.</text>
