            <text syncTime="67.658" offset="429479">There are two substantive issues before the Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.750" offset="457795">The first is whether California can place a moratorium on the construction of nuclear power plants until the California Energy Commission, the principal respondent here, has determined to its satisfaction that there exists a demonstrated technology or means for the disposal of high-level nuclear waste.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.316" offset="568032">The second substantive issue is whether California can refuse to permit a specific nuclear power plant to be built in the state until the Energy Commission finds that there are or will be facilities with adequate capacity to store at any given time the spent nuclear fuel produced by the plant plus all of the fuel loaded into the plant's reactor at that point in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.049" offset="714945">The first of those issues is raised by the enactment by California in 1976 of Section 25524.2 of the California Public Resources Code, referred to in the briefs as the waste disposal statute; and the second issue is raised by the enactment in that same year of Public Resources Code Section 25524.1(b), referred to as the waste storage statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.175" offset="839497">Petitioners contend that both of those statues are invalid as preempted by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as supplemented by the Nuclear Waste Policy Statute of 1982, which was signed by the President just ten days ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.699" offset="921626">There are also, however... there is also, however, before the Court the question of the validity or the... the question of the justiciability of those issues or the ripeness of those issues for determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="524.612" offset="2257214">--Well, all right.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.470" offset="2260662">The NRC has already said in that respect insofar as it is concerned the licensing of nuclear power plants by the NRC need not wait the solution of the long range disposal problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.730" offset="2301727">We think the statute in dealing with the problem in the way that it has dealt with the problem and does deal with the problem indicates, reaffirms the federal government's view that this is a matter for the federal government to decide, and that it should decide all matters in relation to the problems of the disposal of high-level nuclear waste; further affirms the federal determination to go forward and solve that problem, and therefore buttresses what we say is affirmed and found in the '54 Act, as amended, in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.654" offset="2421368">It does seem to be a current enactment of considerable relevance to the issues before the Court, and we thought that it ought to be brought before the Court for its consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.885" offset="2458357">Turning to the issues raised by the respondents as to the justiciability of the questions before the Court this afternoon, respondents have contended that because the Court's writ brings before the Court only the two statutes that I have mentioned and not others, that the Court here really lacks Article III jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.439" offset="2556577">That contention is based on the fact that the action as filed below challenged the validity of a large number of statutes included in California's Warren-Alquist Act, and in particular challenged the validity of about a dozen statutes which taken together set forth a procedure whereby one wishing to build a nuclear power plant in California must file an application for first a... a... what's called a notice of intention and later an application for certification, and then engage upon a procedure in which the California Energy Commission subjects that application to the same kind of inquiries as are made by the NRC in the case of an application for a license to build and later to operate a nuclear power plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.623" offset="2745286">We said all of those statutes, which we describe as the certification system statutes, were also invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.074" offset="2771095">Those questions are not before the Court for decision, and so the contention is that we are not in a position to get a redress from a decision of this Court; that our injury is not redressable.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.709" offset="2821668">We have two responses to make to that, the first of which is that a favorable decision by the Court on the two issues before the Court this afternoon would dispose of two discrete injuries to the petitioners arising out of these statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.765" offset="2889900">It would... it would... it would strike down the... the... the moratorium statute and would as well strike down California's attempt to become involved in the question of deciding how nuclear waste should be stored before it's disposed of.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.991" offset="2954788">Such a favorable decision would also in... of necessity set out the rationale of the Court's decision in terms that could well be applicable and would be applicable, we are certain, to the other statutes that are challenged by petitioners or were challenged below.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.235" offset="3019781">And this particularly with respect to the waste storage statute, because that really is functionally a part of the certification system.</text>

            <text syncTime="723.811" offset="3054053">I understood respondents' contention to be, Mr. McDonough, that your contentions had been kind of like perhaps Christmas trees in parallel rather than in series; that it was the combined effect of each and every one of these statutes that caused you to be uncertain, your client to be uncertain as to whether he could go ahead and build.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.771" offset="3129913">And that if you couldn't challenge a part of this combined weight, so to speak, there was no reason to think that just partial relief was going to solve your problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="753.298" offset="3172022">Indeed that is his position, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.967" offset="3178710">My response to it is simply to say first we will have this... we will have this enlightenment from the Court which will afford an opportunity at that point to reassess the situation of the petitioners to see whether the concerns they felt at the point in time that the action was filed are still sufficiently valid to preclude them from going ahead.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.884" offset="3254360">The second point we would make in response to this contention is that certain redressability by this Court, its judgment or decision, has not always been an absolute requirement of Article III jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.456" offset="3308590">In that... in that respect we refer to the Orr against Orr case decided in 1979 where the Court decided and struck down the Alabama alimony statute because it did not impose an obligation on both husbands and wives to pay alimony, even though it was not certain at that point that the husband petitioner would have relief by reason of this Court's decision, both because there was a possibility that he was bound by contract in any event to pay the alimony, and because the legislature of Alabama might revise the statute to impose a duty on both parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.365" offset="3444218">For those reasons we believe that the first point raised by the respondents as to the ripeness or justiciability of the issues is not well taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.815" offset="3478073">With respect to the ripeness of the moratorium statute itself, we believe there simply that the Court of Appeals was entirely correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.655" offset="3513390">The court said that the challenged statutes stand as an absolute barrier to the construction of the proposed plants, and that that barrier be removed by striking down the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.679" offset="3557485">That would satisfy, we feel, the Article III component of ripeness.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.446" offset="3572532">The court also said that the issue was purely a legal one and that it would not be... its judgment on that issue would not be helped significantly by delay, and that delay would cause substantial hardship to the utilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.562" offset="3629061">That, we think, was the appropriate decision with respect to ripeness on that particular statute, and that the same reasoning, the same rationale should have been applied by the Court of Appeals to Section 25524.1(b) for the same reasons; that is to say, it is one of the statutes that constitutes a barrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.886" offset="3702308">The issue is a legal one.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.820" offset="3710040">With respect to the issue of preemption itself, in our view when California enacted these two statutes in 1976 it could not have entered a more preempted area of this subject matter of nuclear power plants and their governance.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.001" offset="3778794">Congress has always accepted responsibility for the... for the disposition, the storage and disposition of nuclear waste.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.374" offset="3820277">As I referred to earlier, the NRC has decided that it will not withhold its licensing procedures or withhold a license merely because the long-range disposal problem has not yet been solved.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.681" offset="3869492">I referred earlier to the 1982 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.037" offset="3886941">Let me just incorporate that by reference, noting that what it does is to set out with respect to both long-range disposal and interim storage specific procedures whereby the federal government assumes responsibility for solving those problems within a short space of time, and with respect to interim storage particularly, provides that the federal government shall assist the utilities to be certain that there will be ample interim storage available until the depository problem is solved.</text>

            <text syncTime="1292.983" offset="5330781">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.358" offset="5340186">First perhaps a word about the relevance of the new statute enacted ten days ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.279" offset="5359934">It may be... we can't say that it wouldn't... that it would be wholly inappropriate for this Court to remand to the court below to reconsider the case in light of that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.682" offset="5405492">We do not urge that course because we are not at the jurisdictional stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.399" offset="5428375">The case has been fully briefed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.160" offset="5435480">It's now being argued before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.706" offset="5445616">And that statute cuts only one way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.567" offset="5461080">It simply strengthens the case for reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.330" offset="5476127">There is, what is more, an urgency in the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.564" offset="5497025">One of the petitioners... the petitioner has spent some $10 million in developing plans for a plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.777" offset="5537880">That process has been stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.306" offset="5551986">There is a federal commitment, a national commitment to the construction of further plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.273" offset="5583856">And putting those various considerations together, it seems to us unnecessary for this Court to remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.097" offset="5619173">Now, the relevance of that statute is that it reaffirms the federal responsibility and jurisdiction with respect to this discrete question of storage and disposal of nuclear waste.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.604" offset="5685211">Some 63 pages of that statute are devoted to no other subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.430" offset="5708512">What is more, it indicates a congressional view, endorsing the view of the Federal Regulatory Commission, that plants will not shut down, as California fears or pretends to fear, because of the storage or disposal problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.221" offset="5783640">Congress has provided that in case there is a storage problem, there will be a federal facility to take the excess.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.546" offset="5820943">It has furthermore provided through procedures which are lengthy, in which the states are fully consulted, that there will be a final disposal solution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1426.839" offset="5866187">Well, Mr. Claiborne, doesn't that just, in one sense, just mean that the utilities can know when one of the conditions that the state wishes to impose will be met so they can plan on saying well, we'll assume the federal deadlines will be met, so we can target... we know when we will also meet the state condition, which is there must be permanent storage in existence?</text>

            <text syncTime="1469.507" offset="6036819">And that the federal commission has approved that solution, and indeed that a site has been selected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.583" offset="6061165">And as Your Honor pointed out, those procedures are ten years or seven years in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.548" offset="6093034">And in the meantime, California has said nothing further may occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.985" offset="6114768">That delay is substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.063" offset="6123023">Leaving the new statute aside and concentrating on the federal laws that, in our view, at all events control this case so as to require a reversal of the judgment below, we wish to stress that what is present here are two sorts of conflicts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.975" offset="6218736">One is an actual present conflict between the policy of the federal government through its nuclear commission and the laws of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.046" offset="6270981">That is most obviously illustrated in that the federal commission continues to license nuclear power plants, notwithstanding that there is as yet no federally-approved final disposal solution, whereas California says we disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.286" offset="6347990">We will not allow any plant to be certified or built in California until such time as a federally-approved waste disposal system is found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.595" offset="6409221">And what is more, our legislature is satisfied with that solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.873" offset="6434298">There is another sort of conflict, equally serious, which is a conflict of jurisdiction: who shall decide these questions of storage and disposal?</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.572" offset="6481110">California says we will determine, our commission must determine whether in our view there is available storage space, whereas the federal commission has determined to license plants without requiring the kind of storage facility that California leaves itself free to require.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.514" offset="6596884">If any area appears to us to have been wholly preempted... and this is most evident in Section 274(c) of the '59 Act... it is the area of construction, design and disposal of waste.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.756" offset="6669818">California is permitted under that '59 Act, like any other state, to make agreements taking over the jurisdiction of the federal commission with respect to fringe areas but not disposal or storage of high-level nuclear wastes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.623" offset="6753306">California, like every other state, is permitted by Section 274(l) to give advice, to be consulted with respect to these matters of storage and disposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.196" offset="6811611">But the commission, the federal commission under the act very clearly retains its jurisdiction, its responsibility with respect to storage and disposal, as is made clear in Section 274(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.002" offset="6882768">Now, the section on which the respondents rely and on which the court below relied was 274(k), an inartfully worded provision which read most generously might be read to suggest that California can regulate any activity respecting the building or operation of a nuclear power plant so long as it does it with a motive other than protection against radiation hazards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.594" offset="7029159">We suggest it cannot reasonably be read that way in light of the other provisions of the act which I have sketched, because otherwise it would mean that notwithstanding the federal judgment that there is an adequate means of disposal and an interim storage capability, California could say we will ban all plants, not for fear of radiation but because it's aesthetically displeasing to us, it will, in our view, endanger the environment other than through radiation--</text>

            <text syncTime="1855.461" offset="7580656">That fear involves a second-guessing of the federal judgment that there is no such problem of ultimate disposal, and that fear is therefore not one on which California can properly halt the licensing of nuclear plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.029" offset="7658919">And in this respect the new statute is of special relevance because it says at the federal level it has been determined... and indeed by Congress itself... that this problem will be solved.</text>

            <text syncTime="1966.446" offset="8024633">Mr. Claiborne says that the 1982 statute cuts only one way in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.304" offset="8052009">We agree, but we think it cuts entirely in favor of affirmance, though not terribly strongly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.456" offset="8072594">Let me explain why that is when I discuss it in the context of the remaining federal statutory provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.268" offset="8099866">We think that the issue in this case is quite simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.486" offset="8112718">It is a state's authority to decline the nuclear option simply as too uncertain, too costly, to discontinuous, until the states have been assured by actual federal resolution and not simply by a commitment to resolution, assured by actual federal resolution of the nuclear waste, storage and disposal problem that their current fears will not materialize.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.127" offset="8227343">Such state authority can be and has been exercised in a variety of forms: by statute in California, Connecticut, Maine and Oregon; by referendum in Massachusetts; by executive order in New York; by an order of the Public Service Commission in Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.076" offset="8291082">Indeed, similar authority is quite routinely exercised on a plant-by-plant basis in Arizona, Minnesota, Illinois, a couple of dozen other states.</text>

            <text syncTime="2720.669" offset="11041462">Indeed, the comparison with hydroelectric power, in response to your question, Justice Rehnquist, I think is quite instructive, because when the Atomic Energy Act in 1954 was debated and passed, Senator Humphrey proposed that the Atomic Energy Commission's control over nuclear power be as comprehensive, as pervasive as the FPC's control over hydroelectric power; that it should be treated as a national resource to be dealt with in terms of foreign policy and other concerns.</text>

            <text syncTime="3232.412" offset="13088417">And as to that I think that the case that I lost in the Crawford case really reflects the Court's fairly general sense that second-guessing the motives of lawmakers is a very difficult thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.563" offset="13137005">But if we lose our claim under 271, there'd be no choice other than to second guess.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.436" offset="13160515">However, this Court would hardly be the tribunal to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.532" offset="13172950">The Ninth Circuit has already said that the purposes were economic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.530" offset="13184966">The district court made no contrary finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.901" offset="13194370">The record contains not a shred of contrary evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.025" offset="13206909">That is, the focus of the legislature in California at this time was on several alternative ways of dealing with the nuclear problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.150" offset="13243376">One rather more extreme approach was concerned with safety, and that was rejected by the people ultimately.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.318" offset="13268035">The other approach focused, as the legislative committee that proposed it stressed in its reassessment report, focused on problems of cost and reliability, not safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.971" offset="13314638">So that if we do have to rely on Section 274(k), then I think it is very clear that this is a properly motivated law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.137" offset="13347343">One of the reasons I don't want to have to rely on 274(k) is that I think for institutional reasons it makes a great deal more sense to create a rather clean division between those kinds of activities that states are preempted from and cannot engage in under the Atomic Energy Act and those kinds that are somehow suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.756" offset="13421844">And it seems to me that a classic example of a nonproblematic state decision is a state decision simply not to have a particular form of power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.063" offset="13463013">It is only when the states undertake to regulate in detail how that power will be produced that there could be ongoing conflicts between what the states think is appropriate and what the federal regulators think is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.135" offset="13515363">It's only then that we get into this twilight zone of motive.</text>

            <text syncTime="3360.518" offset="13600835">It's my view that the Atomic Energy Act basically puts nuclear power on the shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.908" offset="13622465">It says it's the exclusive responsibility of the NRC to decide how those who buy it are to use it so that it will be safe, but it is not a federal decision whether it is appropriate, whether it is needed, whether it is expensive, and indeed, if someone says we just don't want to take the risks, all of the risks, taken as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.600" offset="13701250">We believe nothing in the Atomic Energy Act precludes that kind of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.367" offset="13716297">Of course, this case, it's important, I think, to stress, does not require the Court to go nearly so far, because the record in this case is unambiguous that California was not trying in some way to protect its people from radiation hazards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.924" offset="13774497">These wastes that we are worrying about, the record makes clear, these wastes are not at the moment targeted in some way for California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.418" offset="13808457">There's nothing in the record suggesting that California was afraid that the permanent waste depository would be located there, that they might try to veto it and fail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.274" offset="13839908">The concern was entirely what happens to the consumers, the ratepayers, the energy users of California if all of the optimism of the nuclear industry and the federal regulators turns out to have proved somewhat overblown, and if one actually has to shut the plants down to protect the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.485" offset="13912737">And it is at that point that California exercises the kind of traditional judgment that we do not think involves a regulation of nuclear power plants, and therefore doesn't raise the motive issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.091" offset="13959131">Now, arguably there's a problem in that respect with respect to one provision that I think is particularly unripe for resolution here; and that is the provision dealing with full core onsite reserve capacity, so that when a reactor is shut down for repairs you don't have to ship its active core miles away during the repair process but can store the core at the site of the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.082" offset="14059128">Now, one could say that that is an attempt by the State of California to dictate some detail of nuclear power plant construction, and that to prevail on that claim we really do have to show that the motive under 274(k) is other than radiation control.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.623" offset="14129240">Even conceding for the sake of argument that in that case we would have to rely on 274(k), this is a provision as to which all parties seem agreed, that the reason has nothing to do with safety, the reason for requiring that the core not have to get shipped miles away.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.975" offset="14190680">The reason, quite simply... and the Solicitor General says so in his brief; petitioners say so in their brief... the reason is that when you have to ship the core away, you close the plant down longer, you have a longer interruption, and it costs more.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.173" offset="14239477">So even as to that provision I think we prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.483" offset="14252747">But I say that that provision is unripe, and that, I think, is a point on which I might close.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.654" offset="14273436">I want the Court to recognize that the provisions dealing with interim storage, as to which the 1982 Act provides some marginal degree of help, do not even become effective in California unless and until the nuclear waste disposal moratorium ends.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.286" offset="14347937">Until the moratorium ends, the storage law has no operation whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.423" offset="14364447">And we do think, therefore, it's unripe for decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.441" offset="14376568">As to the waste disposal law, although the Ninth Circuit in ruling in our favor found it ripe for decision, I think Justice Rehnquist's analogy of the Christmas tree lights strung in parallel really was perfect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.717" offset="14425678">The point that the petitioners themselves have made... they didn't have to, but they've said it... is that it would really not help them at all to have the waste disposal law struck down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.821" offset="14466115">It wouldn't help them at all because, they say in their petition for certiorari, that no rational utility would enter the bramble bush, the thicket, whatever their image, of California certification law unless they were assured that the whole thing was blown up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.643" offset="14525361">But it seems to me perfectly plain that nothing that could possibly be derived from this Court's preemption decisions could warrant completely ousting the states from a regulatory role with respect to electricity simply because the fuel that's used is nuclear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.853" offset="14598190">And unless the Court went that far, I think it's clear from their own concession that they would not be benefited.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.149" offset="14619402">But if the Court does reach the merits, then I think it important to close by saying that California deeply shares the concern expressed in this Court by over 30 states that a ruling for the utilities would leave a vital sphere of traditional state regulation over electricity in a state of complete disarray, creating a regulatory vacuum that Congress has not filled even during the 1973 oil crisis, and at the same time would quite radically shift power to the federal judiciary, power that the states have relied on the Congress to exercise.</text>

            <text syncTime="3659.771" offset="14797870">Yes, if I may, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3661.397" offset="14804349">It is said here that the California legislation does not reflect concern about safety, but on its face it does not say that it does not reflect that concern; and the fact of the matter is that these statutes apply only to plants built in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3677.654" offset="14869446">Should a California utility decide to build a plant outside California, these statues do not apply, and yet the same problems of the clog in the... in the fuel cycle and so forth would then... would then be applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.992" offset="14918765">So... and so we don't concede at all that these are not safety-related statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3694.723" offset="14937678">Number two, Mr. Tribe has said that the states traditionally have the right to decide what technologies may be used within the state to generate electric power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3705.719" offset="14981668">That is true subject to this particular act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.061" offset="14995043">We believe that the principle here, the preemption principle here, is this: that a state statute is preempted which stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress, as stated by Mr. Justice Frankfurter back in Hines against Davidovitz.</text>
            <text syncTime="3726.180" offset="15063483">The key to the decision of this case, we think, is for the Court to make its own decision respecting what can be derived from the course of federal legislation and regulation of this activity over the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3739.894" offset="15118341">What we find there is that Congress did make the decision and has continued to make the decision as recently as 1982 that there shall be a nuclear component in the mix of any state if it possibly can be fitted in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3754.810" offset="15178004">And then the Congress has really in effect divided the decision-making process as to whether it shall go in into two components.</text>
            <text syncTime="3761.275" offset="15203918">Certain matters are for the states to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="3763.790" offset="15213949">We've never challenged it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3764.757" offset="15217815">Need, cost, whether it goes into the rate base, how much goes into the rate base are for the states to decide, condedely; but there are questions that the federal government has decided it will decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="3775.205" offset="15259611">It will decide the question of whether it should... you should not have a plant because of concern about interim storage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3780.719" offset="15281658">The federal government will decide whether you shall not have a plant because of concern about ultimate waste disposal.</text>

            <text syncTime="3825.374" offset="15460336">That's why they enacted the Price-Anderson Act.</text>
