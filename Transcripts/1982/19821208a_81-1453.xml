            <text syncTime="78.350" offset="467916">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="81.135" offset="478992">This case comes from the state of South Dakota, and it was on a writ of certiorari granted in May of this year to review a case involving the refusal by an individual in the state of South Dakota to submit to a blood test.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.128" offset="538969">The facts are very brief but important to this issuer, and I will go through them quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.782" offset="557673">About 9 o'clock in the evening of the 19th of July, 1980, the defendant was stopped by law enforcement officers in the city of Madison, South Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.804" offset="593722">He was stopped for the reason that he failed to stop at a stop sign, and when he was pulled over, he was asked two questions: number one, to get out of the car, and number two, for his driver's license.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.827" offset="633846">As he got out of the automobile, he staggered, fell against the car to, at least in the opinion of the officer, get his balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.683" offset="665193">He also smelled of alcohol, the odor of alcohol.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.468" offset="680344">When asked for his driver's license, he said: I'm not going to lie to you, I don't have one, I lost it because of a prior DWI... which is driving while intoxicated, our statute in South Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.959" offset="730290">After he failed a series of sobriety tests, he was taken down to the station.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.096" offset="750874">He was advised of his Miranda warnings and he was advised of the South Dakota implied consent statute and asked if he would take a blood test, and he refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.885" offset="786087">He was read the implied consent statute a second time, he refused a second time, and on the third occasion, he again was read the implied consent statute and he refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.026" offset="838646">That was at the police station.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.728" offset="845438">The defendant made a motion to suppress his statements, his refusal to take this blood test, and the trial court did suppress the refusal and any related evidence, basically on three grounds: number one, that the statute of South Dakota was unconstitutional; number two, that it was not relevant evidence; and number three, that Mr. Neville had not been advised that if he refused to take the test, that fact of refusal would be used against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.099" offset="974900">And I will point out to the Court that this law changed in South Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.801" offset="989738">It was passed, became effective July 1, 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.170" offset="1003217">This occurrence was some 19 days after the passage of that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.924" offset="1026205">And that statute in part reads:</text>
            <text syncTime="221.193" offset="1039266">"If a person refuses to submit to chemical analysis of his blood, urine, breath or other bodily substance as provided in other subsections, such refusal may be admissible into evidence at the trial. "</text>
            <text syncTime="235.035" offset="1094646">This Court granted the state's request to look at this issue, whether this statute that I have just read to you... which allows the fact of the refusal to take a test to determine blood alcohol content of a motorist to be admitted into evidence at the subsequent trial of the motorist for driving while under the influence of alcohol... violates the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="279.897" offset="1274055">If you look in the appendix on page 9, there is a card that is given to each police officer that is a part of the statute and explains their rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.789" offset="1317627">It does inform them if they do not take the test they may lose their license for up to a year.</text>

            <text syncTime="304.381" offset="1372066">I guess I would point out that the reason this individual was not advised of the fact that his refusal could be used against him is explained by the police officer in the appendix, which is the cards from Pierre, which is the state capitol and where these things are mailed out of, had not updated the new card.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.593" offset="1444895">I might inform the Court now that each individual, if this is found constitutional, and are, in fact, being advised that the refusal could be used against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.616" offset="1480944">So that portion of the case, because of this 19 days, the bureaucracy did not set into operation quick enough, is the only reason that this individual was not so advised.</text>

            <text syncTime="735.124" offset="3094998">First of all, this is a subject that is well known by the population.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.926" offset="3110254">We even have lawyers that have some reputation writing books on the best seller list about driving while intoxicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.746" offset="3137526">So it is something people know about.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.348" offset="3143900">I doubt if you can take 12 citizens in the state of South Dakota, put them in the jury room, and they aren't aware that there is blood tests and should be in cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.704" offset="3177336">So it is important, number one, that those of us that enforce the law can show the jury that we have done it adequately and properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.108" offset="3206907">On the back of every South Dakota driver's license this implied consent law is written.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.946" offset="3226238">The individual in the jury room can pull out his driver's license and know there should be a blood test and that there is a duty and a requirement to take it.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.249" offset="3255495">And we should be able to indicate to the jury first of all we have followed the proper procedures, we allowed this individual or at least offered the blood test to them, and if they did not avail themselves of it, fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.175" offset="3307217">We should also be able to put that in.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.192" offset="3315263">So it is relevant to show, first of all, that we have followed the statutes of the state of South Dakota in the handling of a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.948" offset="3342326">Secondly, it does show consciousness of guilt, and I would like to refer to the federal system, and it is part of the progeny of Gilbert v. California, the Fisher case and the Enge case, but I thought it interesting to see what would a federal district judge do when he reads and finds out that, number one, handwriting samples are admissible, and so he issues an order... and this is not pleading evidence, a handwriting samples, obviously... he orders the defendant to give the court or the prosecution a sample of his handwriting and he fails to do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="847.631" offset="3545036">Here is the suggested pattern federal jury instructions, out of Divett and Blackmar, and I'm paraphrasing a little bit, but here is what the judge would tell the jury in a federal case: There is evidence that the defendant after his arrest refused to furnish a sample of his handwriting.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.573" offset="3608775">It was a lawful order and not in violation of the defendant's privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.877" offset="3629986">Refusal to obey the order is not sufficient to show guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.746" offset="3645451">You may, however, consider the defendant's refusal and may give it such weight as you think it is entitled to as tending to prove consciousness of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.869" offset="3682022">That is what would happen in the federal system, not a violation of the Fifth Amendment, the handwriting, and an inference of guilt or at least tending to prove consciousness of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.075" offset="3726848">Now, Divett and Blackmar is not the Supreme Court, obviously, but it is the suggested pattern jury instructions that we all use and has not been found by any court to be improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.132" offset="3767077">So here South Dakota tried to fashion a remedy, and all the Court is aware of the reason for these implied consent laws, and we are another state, don't want to hold our citizens down and forcefully take this blood sample.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.375" offset="3824024">We don't want that in the state of South Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.410" offset="3836144">But we have made some conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.977" offset="3842414">One of the conditions not discussed here is that if you refuse to take your blood test, you lose your license for one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.933" offset="3874283">That is also common.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.583" offset="3876791">But we have got another hooker in South Dakota, and it is if you don't take the test, you automatically lose your license for a year, but if you plead guilty before the separate hearing on the refusal, the civil hearing on the refusal, then we won't take your driver's license away.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.661" offset="3949098">So in a way, even though you refuse, if you plead guilty, admit your guilt, which is some kind of compulsion, you aren't going to lose your license for a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.583" offset="3980863">Obviously, that is usually to the defendant's advantage and it hasn't been--</text>

            <text syncTime="968.522" offset="4028615">Probably the only time we would see it is on the third offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.307" offset="4039691">It is a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.191" offset="4043243">If an individual took an opportunity on his second offense to do so, he may go in and attack in the federal system his plea on the second offense, trying to throw that out so it isn't a felony, because the third offense is a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.983" offset="4098414">That is the only reason I could ever see you would see it in the federal courts, is an attempt to play the system against itself and say "I was compelled".</text>
            <text syncTime="993.506" offset="4128507">So if you look at the handwriting sample, which some of the justices of this Court in various decisions have said is a real physical evidence, if you can compel in the federal system someone to take a handwriting sample, you can compel them to take a blood test.</text>

            <text syncTime="1032.147" offset="4283047">Handwriting is hand writing, and in the Askew case it took 19 months for the federal judge to get a sample.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.701" offset="4309274">Maybe he learned to write left-handed in the meantime or something.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.170" offset="4323171">But I think the fact is it is pleading evidence and it is scientifically acceptable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.891" offset="4342084">We know when we talk about a 1.5 blood count in courts, and the jury, perhaps, knows what the issue is, what we are talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.311" offset="4375730">It is probably the best evidence there is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.347" offset="4383880">It protects Mr. Gienapp's client as much as it helps the state in determining what is his blood count.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.151" offset="4407077">If Mr. Mason... or Mr. Neville, I mean, who is experienced in this area, would have come out with a.05, he probably would have never faced the charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.006" offset="4446574">So it is an independent test that is reliable and valuable, whereas otherwise you are left with oral testimony: staggering, slurred speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.730" offset="4485444">So we believe that the South Dakota statutory scheme, which is similar to most, is constitutional, and the refusal that we are arguing here today is not that his words can go in...</text>

            <text syncTime="1111.547" offset="4600696">And then the jury knows why.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.582" offset="4608847">Those of us that have defended and prosecuted these cases, you must realize... just as was pointed out in this Court when you approved the instruction of possession of recently stolen property... there are certain things in life that this Court can recognize and know goes into criminal cases or into the affairs of life, and one of them is in a driving while intoxicated case, the jury expects a blood test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.483" offset="4716471">They are waiting to see the blood test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.352" offset="4727860">And the state, if it puts in its refusal, it settles the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.672" offset="4745206">There is no blood test because none was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.238" offset="4755446">It isn't that it was a bad test and the state didn't want to put it in and is in some way trying to push guilt onto this person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.028" offset="4782613">On the other hand, it isn't as if something was done improperly and the court didn't allow it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.015" offset="4806541">It isn't the defendant through some lawyer's trick keeping this from us so that we don't know what the blood test is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.086" offset="4834858">It is simply a physical and real fact that no blood test exists, and that is as real and physical as handwriting or any of the other factors that we can put into evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.494" offset="4880520">So it is in a way the type of real evidence that under our system that the jury expects to see and should see.</text>

I think that's a misnomer in all the cases... the power to refuse, and he exercises that power, we are going to inform the fellow citizens on the jury why there is no blood test, why they haven't gotten what most of us expect in a criminal case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1602.899" offset="6566045">It seems very reasonable under the United States Constitution that a state attempting to give its citizens or any visitors the power to refuse this bodily intrusion are then more limited in their evidentiary presentation to a jury than if they said, we don't care, we don't care, we're going to hold them down, we're going to hire big officers and we're going to find large nurses and we're going to take the blood tests, and then we're going to put in the evidence of how the individual struggled and swore and punched someone, then we have a felony, perhaps, assaulting an officer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1714.989" offset="7014411">Since 1960 South Dakota has statutorily allowed an individual to refuse to take a blood alcohol test, not without some certain civil penalties, but allowed that permission.</text>
