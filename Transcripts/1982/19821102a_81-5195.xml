            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="157436">We will hear arguments first this morning in Jones against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.994" offset="189410">Mr. Wasserstrom, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

          <turn speaker="silas_j_wasserstrom" startTime="11.679" stopTime="130.006">
            <label>Mr. Silas J. Wasserstrom</label>
            <text syncTime="11.679" offset="204143">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.773" offset="212502">In September 1975 the Petitioner was arrested when he tried to steal a coat from a department store.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.817" offset="236639">Six months later he was brought to trial on a charge of attempted petty larceny.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.969" offset="257224">Had the Petitioner pled guilty to that offense or been convicted of it after trial, he could have received a maximum sentence of one year in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.951" offset="289198">He would have been released, at the very latest, in September of 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.355" offset="310827">He would now long since have been a free man.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.011" offset="321380">But Petitioner did not plead guilty and was not convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.102" offset="337785">Instead, he raised an insanity defense, claiming that because he was mentally ill at the time he tried to steal the coat he should not be blamed for his act.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.489" offset="383343">The Government did not contest this claim and the trial court found, after a stipulated trial, that the Petitioner was not guilty by reason of insanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.516" offset="419496">On the basis of this acquittal and on this basis alone, the Petitioner was ordered committed indefinitely to a mental hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.873" offset="452829">That is, he was ordered confined until he could prove that he was not mentally ill and dangerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.261" offset="474458">The Petitioner still remains confined in the hospital on the basis of that commitment, even though more than seven years have now passed six his initial incarceration and more than six years have passed since the time he would have necessarily been released had he been convicted rather than acquitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.973" offset="545302">Conceivably, he will remain committed in the hospital for the rest of his life.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.331" offset="566723">Petitioner contends that whatever the validity of his initial commitment to the hospital, once he has been confined there for longer than he could have been incarcerated upon conviction, his commitment became an indefinite one.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.262" offset="610399">Thus, the Government was constitutionally required to prove the need for his commitment by clear and convincing evidence, something which the Government has yet to do with respect to Mr. Jones.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.897" offset="657002">If it cannot do so now, Petitioner submits, he is entitled to release.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="130.006" offset="677377">Mr. Wasserstrom, you're not challenging, as I understand it, the initial commitment.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.300" offset="710605">The only question, if I understand your position correctly, that you raise is whether he must be released at the time that the sentence period would have expired under the criminal statute, is that right?</text>

            <label>Mr. Silas J. Wasserstrom</label>
            <text syncTime="152.464" offset="767238">Our position is, Your Honor, that he has to be released at that time unless the Government can at that time prove his commitability by the standards required.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="160.570" stopTime="167.737">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="160.570" offset="799630">And you are not challenging, then, the standard or burden of proof at the time of his commitment?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="silas_j_wasserstrom" startTime="167.737" stopTime="201.007">
            <label>Mr. Silas J. Wasserstrom</label>
            <text syncTime="167.737" offset="828365">It's our position that question is not raised in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.596" offset="839754">There are arguable justifications for that initial commitment, and we don't discuss one way or another whether those justifications are sufficient to validate that initial commitment and we don't think the Court need reach that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.061" offset="901612">Whatever reasons there are that might have justified his initial commitment, those reasons would have justified only a commitment that could have lasted, without the Government meeting a burden of proof, for as long as he could have been incarcerated upon conviction.</text>

          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="201.007" stopTime="212.706">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="201.007" offset="961380">If his initial commitment is not punitive, then how is the statutory period of time that he could serve on the criminal charge relevant?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="silas_j_wasserstrom" startTime="212.706" stopTime="225.045">
            <label>Mr. Silas J. Wasserstrom</label>
            <text syncTime="212.706" offset="1008192">Well, we think the only justifications that could, the only justifications that could countenance that initial commitment are punitive in nature, that is, are a kind of punitive rationale.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="225.045" stopTime="232.790">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="225.045" offset="1057616">And so for us to agree with your position we would have to conclude that his initial commitment was punitive?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="silas_j_wasserstrom" startTime="232.790" stopTime="269.386">
            <label>Mr. Silas J. Wasserstrom</label>
            <text syncTime="232.790" offset="1088545">Your Honor, I don't think that it's terribly important whether the word "punitive" is used, but I do think that any kinds of justifications which would justify the initial commitment are what I would call backward looking justifications, that is, justifications that do turn on the fact that he was found to have committed a criminal act beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.971" offset="1165240">And whether they're treated as purely punitive or not doesn't seem to me is important, or the label that we attach to them it doesn't seem to me is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.533" offset="1183526">The point is, though, those rationales all do turn on the nature of his act, and his act is one which, we submit, justifies confinement only for a year.</text>

          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="269.386" stopTime="289.020">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="269.386" offset="1234935">But hasn't this Court, as well as the United States Court of Appeals in the D.C. Circuit, said there's no rational connection between the possible sentence and the possible length of stay after an acquittal, not guilty by reason of insanity?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="silas_j_wasserstrom" startTime="289.020" stopTime="314.055">
            <label>Mr. Silas J. Wasserstrom</label>
            <text syncTime="289.020" offset="1313511">I believe that the law in the United States Court of Appeals in Brown against the United States and in Wade v. Jacobs, in both of those cases the Court suggested that there is a relationship between the sentence that might have been imposed and the length that the commitment can persist without the Government proving commitability under civil commitment standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.417" offset="1391043">I don't think that this Court has addressed that question, and I think this is the first case that raises it.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="314.055" stopTime="319.694">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="314.055" offset="1413612">Oh, the Court has said expressly that there's no connection, in one case some time ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.399" offset="1430958">Well, excuse me.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="silas_j_wasserstrom" startTime="319.694" stopTime="346.042">
            <label>Mr. Silas J. Wasserstrom</label>
            <text syncTime="319.694" offset="1436182">Well, it is true in Lynch v. Overholser this Court suggested certain rationales for a commitment, but it didn't then go on to say whether those rationales were ones which would justify an indefinite commitment or simply one that would persist as long as the sentence might have been imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.579" offset="1491666">And it's our view that those rationales, whether you call them punitive or not, are all ones which evaporate once the insanity acquittee has been confined for as long as he could have been confined if he had been convicted.</text>

            <text syncTime="346.042" offset="1541508">Does your position depend at all on whether or not the initial crime was a crime of violence?</text>

            <label>Mr. Joshua I. Schwartz</label>
            <text syncTime="1588.596" offset="6511774">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.137" offset="6553883">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.886" offset="6564959">This case presents to the Court for review under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment a key portion of the coordinated scheme enacted by the United States Congress to govern in the District of Columbia two critical problems: One is the question of whether persons who claim that because of reason of mental illness they should be excused from criminal responsibility should in fact be so excused.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.407" offset="6679062">The second is the question whether it is sufficient that persons who successfully raise that criminal defense may be treated like other persons who are candidates for civil commitment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.823" offset="6728695">The question, in other words, is whether it was proper for Congress to recognize, as it did, that special procedures are warranted for the treatment of criminal acquittees to protect society's public interests in preventing the injuries that may be caused by those individuals who have been excused from criminal responsibility by reason of insanity at the time of a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.999" offset="6829423">These are issues that every jurisdiction confronts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.422" offset="6843111">They're fundamental to our criminal justice system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.483" offset="6855336">We do not submit that every jurisdiction must answer them the same way, and in fact, as the briefs indicate, there is considerable flux in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.558" offset="6891594">We do deem it very significant that the majority of the states have chosen to enact special procedures for the handling of criminal acquittees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.566" offset="6935689">But even if that were not so, in confronting this case we think the Court should not lose sight of the fundamental fact that Congress or any state legislature entering into this sphere must confront two conflicting imperatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.485" offset="6995353">One is to convict only those persons who may justly be held criminally responsible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.560" offset="7019594">At the same time, a state legislature or Congress must provide adequate safeguards to society.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.962" offset="7049269">The two procedures rest, one on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.384" offset="7058883">It's not tolerable to have an insanity defense unless some mechanism for providing a tolerable degree of safety to society is available to ensure another means of protecting society from those persons who do remain dangerously mentally ill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.360" offset="7122830">The scheme that the Court is confronted with today is actually the product of several revisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.360" offset="7150834">On two occasions, in 1955 and then again in 1970, Congress reacted to decisions in two cases of the D.C. Court of Appeals and in one case a decision of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.791" offset="7200571">And Congress has attempted, made what we think is a constitutionally acceptable effort to fine-tuning this statute to meet various constitutional and statutory concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.225" offset="7246233">The first amendment that's of relevance here by way of background occurred in 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.833" offset="7268698">Congress responded to the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in Durham against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.078" offset="7297746">In Durham, the D.C. Circuit acted to expand the insanity defense, adopting the rule that every individual who can show... every individual whose crime is the product of mental illness or mental disease or defect at the time of the crime is to be excused from that responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.444" offset="7379144">Congress was concerned that the effect of the Durham decision, abandoning the M'Naughten rule which had theretofore prevailed, was to make the insanity defense much more widely available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.191" offset="7426164">Congress was concerned that some mechanism should be provided to assure that insanity acquittees did not simply fall through the cracks and that they be appropriately considered for civil commitment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.982" offset="7481335">The next thing that's of relevance here is this Court's 1962 decision in Lynch against Overholser.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.931" offset="7509129">In that case the Court was confronted with a constitutional challenge quite similar to the one presented today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.335" offset="7534729">It was argued that the 1955 version of the statute at issue here, which simply provided for an automatic indefinite commitment, was unconstitutional because it did not provide for any follow-up hearing to determine the present mental illness or dangerousness of the acquittee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.766" offset="7612469">It was especially contended that that procedure was unconstitutional because under Davis against the United States this Court had prescribed the rule for the federal courts that an insanity defense might be sustained simply because the Government had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was sane at the time of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.207" offset="7702226">The Court ultimately found it unnecessary, however, to answer the constitutional questions presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.847" offset="7724796">The Court concluded that the statute as then written did not apply to persons such as Lynch, who had not affirmatively availed themselves of the insanity defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.592" offset="7771712">The court in that case had imposed the insanity defense upon him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.934" offset="7785087">Nevertheless, Mr. Justice Harlan in his opinion for the Court noted that whatever problems of rationality might infect such a statutory scheme, which is, as I say, significantly different from the present one, might well not exist when the statute is applied to persons such as the present Petitioner, who have affirmatively availed themselves of the insanity defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.094" offset="7885710">The issues which this Court was not required to answer in Lynch against Overholser were answered by the D.C. Circuit in Bolton against Harris.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.716" offset="7928238">There the Court answered the constitutional questions by engrafting onto the statute the requirement that a second hearing be held similar to the 50-day hearing now required by statute, at which time the issues for the court would be the present mental illness and dangerousness of the acquitted defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.286" offset="8002530">And the D.C. Circuit required that that hearing conform generally to the requirements of civil commitments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.421" offset="8039101">In 1970, Congress enacted the reform statute for the District of Columbia courts, and among the problems it addressed were those it perceived arising from the decisions in Lynch and Bolton against Harris.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.275" offset="8098452">The court codified this Court's... excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.414" offset="8110990">The Congress codified this Court's decision in Lynch, making it clear that this procedure which we are discussing today does not have any application to an individual who does not wish to raise the insanity defense but who is nonetheless adjudicated to be insane.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.003" offset="8169400">Congress also undertook to repair the constitutional defect recognized by the D.C. Circuit in Bolton against Harris.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.985" offset="8209315">Congress, however, had options open to it which it as a legislature had available, which were not available to the D.C. Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.104" offset="8241812">The problems that the D.C. Circuit had recognized were the absence of affirmative proof at the criminal trial of actual insanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.648" offset="8275980">In addition, the D.C. Circuit had commented upon the gap, the possibility that the mental status of the acquittee had changed in the interval between the time of the crime and the time of the commitment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.299" offset="8334598">Congress undertook to repair both of these problems, as I say.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.720" offset="8352257">Congress in Bolton increased the probative value of the adjudication of not guilty by reason of insanity, by requiring that that defense could not be made out unless the court concluded by a preponderance of the evidence shown by the defendant, that the defendant was in fact mentally ill and legally insane and that that insanity was, under the substantive legal standard prevailing, sufficient to excuse the crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="2121.220" offset="8642216">Well, it changed the result of Davis for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.765" offset="8664473">I took a different inference from the term "overruling", obviously, than was intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.577" offset="8683699">It did change the rule of Davis for the District of Columbia, thereby creating a predicate which had not therefore existed in to be considered in prescribing the appropriate procedures for the subsequent commitment procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.507" offset="8747438">Congress, rather than placing the burden of proof upon the Government at the follow-up hearing, however, which was required, Congress did place the burden of proof upon the defendant, the acquitted defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.767" offset="8812430">However, it compensated for this, in its view, by requiring that the proof at the criminal trial be affirmative by a preponderance of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.635" offset="8863944">The particular thing of importance to this Court's decision that we believe emerges from the legislative history is that Congress deemed it particularly unacceptable that there be a disparity in the burdens of proof between the procedures used at the criminal trial and the procedures used in the commitment phase.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.860" offset="8940848">As this Court's decision in Addington and its more recent decision last term in Santosky against Kramer stress, the purpose of a burden of proof is to reflect a societal judgment as to the fair allocation of the risk of error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.526" offset="8999467">Congress believed that it was unfair that the risk of an erroneous factfinding decision be allocated in a manner in the commitment proceeding that was not coordinated with the allocation of the risk of error at the insanity trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.803" offset="9064564">So Congress adopted comparable burdens, in each case a preponderance of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.912" offset="9085044">Were that not so, were that not done, Congress recognized that the so-called revolving door phenomenon would exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.611" offset="9119839">That is, individuals could be adjudicated to be not criminally responsible by reason of insanity and merely because of the disparity in the burdens of proof, not because of a change in mental status, that individual might escape commitment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.367" offset="9186817">Congress thought it unacceptable for there to be that disparity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.382" offset="9206879">Section 301(d) therefore provides today for a temporary automatic commitment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.647" offset="9235927">Following that temporary commitment, which is not to exceed 50 days, a hearing is held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.222" offset="9262259">In that interim period, although the statute does not say so in so many words, the decisions of the D.C. Court of Appeals and the D.C. Circuit both interpret the statute to require that the hospital to which the individual is temporarily committed undertake a psychiatric or psychological evaluation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.165" offset="9338014">By the way, so far as we're aware there's nothing in the statute which specifies in any way what type of professional is to undertake that evaluation, and certainly there is no issue in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2439.264" offset="9914484">Certainly the burden of going forward was in fact borne by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.980" offset="9929322">Mr. Kraekoff, the Assistant United States Attorney, on the page you're referring to, as I recall, said that he thought the burden was upon the Defendant, but nevertheless the Government was prepared to proceed, and he asked whether that would suit the pleasure of the court and of the Petitioner's counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.442" offset="9999121">In fact, Petitioner's counsel had no witnesses and all agreed that the Government should put on its evidence, and it did so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.515" offset="10027438">Furthermore, that evidence was uncontradicted and was not challenged in any way by the cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.094" offset="10053769">Indeed, we suggest that it's possible to read the transcript as embodying a concession by Petitioner's counsel that the facts were as the Government's witness claimed they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.684" offset="10092117">In any event, what is critical, we think, to the Court's decision is that this case does not present any issue about whether the burden of going forward with the evidence may be placed upon the acquittee, because it was not in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.440" offset="10155124">And furthermore, we are advised by St. Elizabeth's Hospital and the U.S. Attorney's office here in the District of Columbia that it simply has not ever occurred so far as we know that an individual's commitment has been continued simply because of a lack of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.811" offset="10228580">That is, the Government always undertakes to present or to sponsor the testimony of the doctors from St. Elizabeth's Hospital who have examined the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.978" offset="10269332">There are times when the Government does not particularly agree with that testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.494" offset="10287408">The decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in United States versus Ecker refers to the peculiar situation and the fact that this hearing is not always strictly adversary because the Government, as counsel for St. Elizabeth's Hospital, does not in fact in its capacity as prosecutor agree with that testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.203" offset="10370164">But the testimony is nevertheless provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.543" offset="10379568">The hospital provides a report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.341" offset="10386778">It is open to the Government to find other witnesses if it wishes if it doesn't agree with that report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.651" offset="10411960">But evidence is provided to support the commitment, and clearly the record reveals that happened in this case and it's our understanding that that is the norm.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.834" offset="10448740">The other issue is the burden, the risk of nonpersuasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.816" offset="10464623">We would submit that the relevant datum in this case is the ultimate conclusion of the Superior Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.421" offset="10507046">The court entered its findings, and I'd like to read them if I may, that Petitioner</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.592" offset="10527735">"is mentally ill and as a result of his mental illness at this time he constitutes a danger to himself or others. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.308" offset="10562634">We'd suggest that, particularly in light of the absence of any contrary argument by Petitioner's counsel, it is perfectly reasonable to infer that the court concluded that, wherever the law might place the risk of nonpersuasion, the Government had successfully shouldered it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3038.626" offset="12311898">However, we would argue, should the Court view the facts in a different manner, that that nevertheless was a commitment hearing and not a release hearing, because the statute prescribes that the hearing must be held, that the court must make findings, determine the issues and making findings and conclusions which are reviewable upon appeal, and that in effect... and that the only way commitment can be continued without a determination of the issue of present mental illness and dangerousness is if the defendant waives that hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.020" offset="12437495">So it's not possible for the commitment to just go on of its own force unless the defendant exercises his right to waive it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3434.275" offset="13894500">First, with respect to the hearing that was held after 50 days, we would submit that, although the Government did call the only witness who testified, that witness in fact presented no evidence whatsoever as to the Petitioner's dangerousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.754" offset="13952388">Her only testimony was that he at one point refused to carry out a project involving lacquering some copper-work and gave some anxiety to his supervisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.360" offset="13994811">That was the extent of the evidence with respect to his dangerousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.297" offset="14006618">She also said something to the effect that, well, I don't know what crime he committed before, but whatever it was he might very well commit it again.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.511" offset="14035457">She obviously did not give any meaningful testimony with respect to dangerousness.</text>

            <text syncTime="3559.929" offset="14397096">The Congressional concerns which Mr. Schwartz so eloquently described when he began his presentation we would submit are fully vindicated by the rule which we're asking this Court to adopt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.830" offset="14436698">That is, a rule which says that the Petitioner can be confined under a procedure where he bears the burden of proof, but only so long as he could be confined had he been convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.594" offset="14475777">Those concerns about revolving doors and so on are simply fully vindicated under the rule we ask this Court to adopt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.200" offset="14502213">Whatever burdens this Court may feel the Defendant was saddling himself with when he raised an insanity defense, surely he did not expect that as a result of raising that insanity defense he would be treated worse than he would have been treated had he pled guilty or been convicted.</text>

            <text syncTime="3648.440" offset="14751108">Now, it is true that when the Government talks about Addington it mentions the fact that one reason the Court decided Addington as it did and did not impose a higher burden of proof, that is guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, was because of the safety valves that are built into the system after commitment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.027" offset="14809518">And so to the extent, I think, that the Government itself relies on that sort of thinking, the different release provisions that apply for insanity acquittees should perhaps go into this Court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.180" offset="14854135">But they aren't strictly speaking raised by this case, because the Petitioner here has not been hurt by those differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="3680.474" offset="14879317">The major difference is that where there's a civil commitment the hospital can release the Petitioner outright or give him a conditional release without going back to court, whereas with insanity acquittees the court has to approve even conditional releases.</text>
