            <text syncTime="8.513" offset="189139">Mr. Attorney General, I think you may proceed when you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_o_wefald" startTime="36.924" stopTime="267.722">
            <label>Mr. Robert O. Wefald</label>
            <text syncTime="36.924" offset="302824">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this appeal involves a statutory construction of the word 1961 and the constitutionality of certain North Dakota statutes believed by the United States to unconstitutionally interfere with the acquisition of wetland easements for waterfowl production areas in North Dakota's prairie pothole region covering central and northwest North Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.397" offset="420689">Three issues developed at the proceedings below.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.771" offset="434168">Briefly, these are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.425" offset="440855">First, the United States sought a declaratory judgment action that these several North Dakota laws are unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.282" offset="468231">Second, the district court held that these laws are unconstitutional, and that no consent is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.747" offset="506161">Third, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held not only are these laws unconstitutional and that no consent is required, but that consent is present here and cannot be revoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.039" offset="559242">As you will see, the dispute between the United States and North Dakota has been narrowed through several concessions made by the United States in its brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.206" offset="591947">The United States has conceded that consent is required, but that consent can be revoked after a reasonable period of time, and that some of the challenged laws are constitutional, and that others are constitutional only insofar as they cover future acquisitions of wetlands in excess of those wetlands not yet acquired under consents the United States claims to hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.166" offset="691840">Let me first deal with the question of consent, including whether it is required, whether it has been revoked, and whether it has been exhausted.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.772" offset="726217">I then want to deal with the constitutionality of the North Dakota laws in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.504" offset="749100">Our argument today is staged against the backdrop of our position that the acquisition of these wetlands involves two separate and disinct steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.750" offset="786089">First, consent must be obtained from our governor.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.905" offset="802703">Second, easements must be governed by the real property law of the state of North Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.840" offset="826527">Let me point out that we are talking here about easements, not fee land.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.884" offset="850664">Secondly, I want to point out that consent seems to be the main issue as opposed to the unconstitutionality of our laws, because the United States has essentially taken the position that our laws basically constitute a condition of prior gubernatorial consent, and to that extent it cannot fall through on the revocation that we cannot do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.374" offset="952646">In other words, the governor says... the United States says, you cannot revoke, you cannot condition your laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.169" offset="975843">Let's first of all talk about the consent and the first concession on Pages 12 and 16, particularly Footnote 11 of the United States' brief on Page 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.414" offset="1016803">I think that concession, our brief adequately sets forth the laws we are talking about and the particular error made by both the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals and the District Court, where they held that the gubernatorial consent provision simply doesn't apply, and I think that is adequately taken care of, and I will not be addressing that particular point.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.092" offset="1115546">Let's talk now about the consent and the revocation of the consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.167" offset="1139787">The revocation we are talking about here is prospective only.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.651" offset="1157760">North Dakota does not assert that the consent of our governor to the acquisition of these wetland easements is retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.632" offset="1185658">We are only talking about prospective.</text>

            <text syncTime="294.525" offset="1333198">What we are suggesting is that there is... that the governor of our state has the right to say, I hereby no longer consent to the acquisition of any easements.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.708" offset="1373949">What the United States is suggesting is that somehow in the early sixties, 1961 through '64, and again in the early seventies with Governor Link, that certain consents were signed, and that those consents are irrevocable.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.515" offset="1425149">Now, an example of that consent is found on the Joint Appendix, Page 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.140" offset="1443644">A couple of things to notice about that consent form, first of all.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.090" offset="1463497">That was prepared by the Fish and Wildlife Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.230" offset="1476036">That document is on official Wildlife Service letterhead.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.320" offset="1492440">The United States says, well, it says unequivocally in there that the governor consents, and it doesn't say that he says, I am reserving the right to revoke.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.208" offset="1535908">Query: If the United States, the Fish and Wildlife Service, as the drafter of that instrument had wanted to be clear that the governor could not revoke, couldn't they have out into their instrument, this should be irrevocable?</text>
            <text syncTime="359.202" offset="1591915">And query: Do you think our governor would have signed it under that circumstance?</text>

Key, on Footnote 14 of Page 19 in the United States' brief, the United States in fact claims the entire tract is part of the National Wildlife Refuge System, but it says that it is only for access.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.057" offset="5599307">Let's take a look at the laws for just a few moments here that are alleged to be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.055" offset="5619369">The laws basically are in two groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.912" offset="5634729">One is entitled 47, and that's the one that deals strictly with easements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.770" offset="5650194">That's the one that says all easements in North Dakota, regardless of by whom held, will not be in excess of 99 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.486" offset="5677048">No direction from the United States Congress as to how long these easements are to be held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.342" offset="5696483">That is simply an administrative determination by the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.904" offset="5706723">At the time the legislation was enacted, they were taking easements of 20, 30, up to 99 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.387" offset="5728666">The Secretary desires perpetual easements, but that is not required, and in fact that is governed by the law of the state of North Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.853" offset="5762520">We deem it not to be an impediment, and we believe that it should be upheld as to constitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.084" offset="5783418">As to Section S of the provisions in Title 20.1, they are in 0218, 18.1, 18.2, 18.3, somewhat run together, 18 is our 1931 legislative consent, and we simply amended that to say that if you don't agree with us, that is, if you don't go along with the other sections, we are going to revoke the consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.745" offset="5890102">18.1 simply provides for public participation in the wetlands acquisition process, public comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.086" offset="5919464">I think there is an objection to the environmental impact statement type requirement, but as we argue this case here in the capital of this great nation from which NEPA came and the environmental impact statements, surely it is clear that there is a right and a good reason for public participation and a need for doing so, whether it is at the federal level or the state level, and we simply imposed a reasonable and a rational requirement in fulfillment of our sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.608" offset="6021551">The 18.2 law advises the landowners of their right to negotiate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.261" offset="6044120">There is nothing wrong with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.556" offset="6049345">There can't be anything unconstitutional about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.244" offset="6056137">And indeed, the United States concedes that that is constitutional, notwithstanding the pronouncements of the courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.678" offset="6089887">They simply indicate that the constitutionality is dubious insofar as that section talks about after expanded wetlands and the right of the farmer to drain those after expanded wetlands back down to the original wetland parameters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.314" offset="6152372">Insofar as that happens, we believe that unless the government negotiates specifically with the individual, unless the farmer knows of his right to negotiate about the after expanded wetlands, that the government has not made a valid acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.821" offset="6218409">In other words, if they want the after expanded wetlands, then they should negotiate with the farmer, and the farmer should be free to negotiate, and I can't imagine that there is anything unconstitutional with that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1929.539" offset="7873319">North Dakota has come to rely more and more on its argument that even if its governor's consent cannot be revoked, the United States already has acquired more acreage than the governors already... ever approved, but the state did not present this issue in its jurisdictional statement, and it therefore cannot rely on it before this Court, nor is that issue fairly comprised within the issues that were presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.076" offset="7959418">And in any event, the contention is specious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.794" offset="7970285">It is because of the peculiar nature of waterfowl production area country, that is, lands that have been... that are characterized by numerous small, scattered, and irregularly shaped wetland.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.570" offset="8013440">The Secretary early on adopted the practice of acquiring easements covering all of the wetlands occurring on a given described legal subdivision, but while the easement instrument describes a legal subdivision, the easement restrictions which are only on draining, filling, leveling, and burning, expressly apply only to the wetlands occurring on that subdivision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.545" offset="8105286">The landowner thus remains completely free to utilize and dispose of the entire balance of his land, that is, the upland, in any way he sees fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.090" offset="8139454">The only conceivable restriction on the landowner's use of the uplands, in addition to not impeding the Secretary's right of access across them to get to the wetlands, is that he cannot take any action on the uplands that would have the expressly prohibited purpose of draining the wetlands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.599" offset="8201521">Indeed, Interior's standard easement document permits the landowner to farm even the wetlands when they are dry of natural causes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.968" offset="8246974">As General Wefald pointed out, the question before this Court is a straightforward one of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.388" offset="8268708">The Duck Stamp Act authorizes the United States to use money from the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund to purchase small wetland and pothole areas, interests in them, and rights of way to provide access to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.648" offset="8321684">When Congress became aware in the late 1950's of the ongoing destruction of much of the nation's wetlands, it authorized the United States to buy up portions of these wetlands in order to preserve the desired waterfowl populations and distribution, and in 1961, in the Wetlands Loan Act, it authorized a $105 million interest-free loan to the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund in order to make possible a crash program of wetlands acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.402" offset="8440698">At the same time, it provided that no land shall be acquired with money from the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund unless the acquisition thereof has been approved by the governor of the state or the appropriate state agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.662" offset="8493779">The question in this case is whether Congress intended that governors would be permitted to revoke those consents once validly given.</text>
