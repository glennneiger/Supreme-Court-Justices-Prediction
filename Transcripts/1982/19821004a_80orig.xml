            <text syncTime="60.491" offset="394467">But I think it's also important that the Court understands what people in the West feel about the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.213" offset="417350">I'd like to quote briefly from the Western Natural Resource Litigation Digest, the quarterly publication of the Western Conference of Attorneys General.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.172" offset="457161">In January 1982, the court's special master recommended that Colorado Fuel and Iron Steel Corporation be given first priority on the Vermejo River in an action brought by the State of Colorado for the apportionment of the river between the states of Colorado and New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.662" offset="531140">For the past 100 years, the river has been fully appropriated in New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.768" offset="551620">The decision ignored both New Mexico's historical dependence on the Vermejo and their traditional guiding principle that prior appropriation governs.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.722" offset="591430">The Special Master's new test balances the economic efficiency of existing uses against the efficiency of proposed uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.548" offset="626748">In this case, the test is used in a further departure from previous case law to vary the priorities such that existing economies based upon senior uses are undermined.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard A. Simms</label>
            <text syncTime="164.589" offset="810859">I think the central issues are three, Justice Burger.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.501" offset="822562">I think the Special Master started with a manifest misunderstanding of equitable apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.164" offset="849206">I think he ignored the relevant facts in this case and attributed legal significance to irrelevant facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.542" offset="882643">And with respect to his ultimate finding that CF&amp;I's proposed diversion would have little effect on New Mexico users, I believe that is not a finding at all but is demonstrably an erroneous conclusion of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.380" offset="938023">I think the real irony of the Master's report lies in his understanding that... and I'm quoting him from page 21 of the report... the unique circumstances which confronts the Master in this case is Colorado's failure to divert water and put it to beneficial use at any time in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.650" offset="1007091">New Mexico has applied the water and has existing economies which are dependent upon that water.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.216" offset="1033422">Instead of applying, the rather obvious holdings of this Court in Wyoming versus Colorado and Nebraska versus Wyoming and in Arizona versus California, the Master instead has equated the cause of action in this case with the relief sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.776" offset="1103639">The way he puts it is this, and I'll quote him again... simply stated, the doctrine says that each state is equal to all of the others, and as quasi-sovereigns, each state is entitled to a share of a river flowing between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.375" offset="1157974">We think that the Master started with the view that each state is entitled to a portion of the waters of an interstate stream no matter what the circumstances might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.263" offset="1205621">This is best illustrated I think by the Master's treatment of the first equitable apportionment decision handed down by this Court in 1906, Kansas versus Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.050" offset="1248671">That case, very unlike the case before this Court today, showed... the facts in that case showed a pattern of contemporaneous development in both states.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.177" offset="1293184">By 1883 in Kansas, there were some 1,200,000 acres of irrigation on the Arkansas in Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.363" offset="1325993">Between 1884 and 1891, there had developed independently under the law or prior appropriation in Colorado some 300,100 acres of land.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.841" offset="1375835">That situation presented the classic equitable apportionment case.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.563" offset="1394748">The water supply became insufficient to satisfy the simultaneous growth in both states, and there appeared a conflict in the social and economic institutions which had developed independently.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.663" offset="1447202">There, the substantive laws of each state... and as you'll recall, it was said in Kansas versus Colorado that there is no federal law of water in the West; each state has a right to develop its own system under which rights to the use of water might be protected... each state had done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.146" offset="1521076">The substantive laws in Kansas versus Colorado had been exercised historically.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.739" offset="1543437">In that case there was an actual conflict between existing users on either side of the state line.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.083" offset="1568828">Because in Kansas they have the doctrine of riparianism, which stands for the proposition that water should be maintained in the river and let down the river undiminished, and on Colorado's side you have priority of appropriation, a doctrine which allows water to be diverted from the river and taken to lands not riparian to the river, you had an actual collision of sovereigns in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.799" offset="1675721">Also, the sovereign interest on both sides of the Kansas-Colorado border arose from actual existing uses of water in the respective states.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.806" offset="1723786">Notwithstanding those obvious differences from this case, the Master has said, and I'm quoting, The same type of situation exists in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="402.694" offset="1763283">Mr. Simms, may I ask you whether it's your position that as between two states, both of which are states using the appropriated water theory, that the prior appropriator must make reasonable use of the water that's appropriated?</text>
            <text syncTime="422.357" offset="1841964">Do we measure the decreed rights or the appropriated rights by some measure of reasonable use, in your view?</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard A. Simms</label>
            <text syncTime="433.294" offset="1885745">The court has said that each state is obligated to conserve water to the extent that is economically possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.998" offset="1916465">There is no evidence in this case and no discussion in the Special Master's report, as opposed to Colorado's reply brief, that there were any uses in New Mexico that were not responsible uses of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.179" offset="1977278">The measure of water, I think, is one that the Master did not follow, and I think it's one of his fundamental mistakes.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.865" offset="2004028">What the Master should have done in assessing the water right entitlements in New Mexico so that he could further assess injury was to look to the actual historic irrigated acreage on the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.082" offset="2060870">That is not necessarily the decreed right.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.155" offset="2073095">It is something that can be discovered through a look at what's been irrigated historically.</text>

            <text syncTime="486.289" offset="2097651">If the historic use is somehow wasteful, can the Master take that into consideration or not?</text>

            <text syncTime="494.745" offset="2131505">And I would point out that there is nothing in the record in this case that indicates that there is any waste.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.458" offset="2154389">You'll find a lengthy, uninhibited discussion of that in Colorado's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.960" offset="2172361">You will find no discussion of it in the Special Master's report.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.214" offset="2189393">I think it's important also in that regard to make a distinction early on.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.616" offset="2211022">And the term inefficiency and the term waste are used, Justice O'Connor, throughout the briefs in this case, and they're important to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.572" offset="2246757">But the Court should know that efficiency is a term of art in irrigation in the West.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.896" offset="2268073">It's not inefficiency in the pejorative sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.721" offset="2287404">Efficiency in irrigation is a term used to describe the amount of water diverted which is not consumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.755" offset="2319587">Typically, in a farming operation a farmer might divert 100-acre feet of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.650" offset="2343097">In the actual growth of plants, in evapo-transpiration, perhaps 50 percent of that would be utilized.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.253" offset="2373504">The rest goes back to the regimen of the stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.585" offset="2386878">That use is called 50 percent efficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.168" offset="2401193">The inefficiency results from a bunch of physical factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.201" offset="2421360">Those physical factors are a function of the porosity of soils, they're a function of local temperature, winds, evaporation rates and other physical factors.</text>

            <text syncTime="608.687" offset="2587290">There is not one iota of evidence in this case that indicates that New Mexico's farmers could have been more efficient historically than they have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.365" offset="2625951">They don't have the money in the Vermejo Conservancy District, as an example, to go buy extremely expensive sprinkler irrigation systems and thus improve the irrigation efficiency by 10 to 20 percent.</text>

            <text syncTime="668.849" offset="2827930">As a matter of fact, I think the Master had the numbers backwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.331" offset="2841827">Actually, 67 percent of the water diverted is lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.483" offset="2862411">The efficiency of the Vermejo Conservancy District, as an example, is roughly in the middle of the efficiency of Western reclamation projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.170" offset="2901177">That efficiency is 54 percent.</text>

            <text syncTime="866.979" offset="3620485">The reason for priority of appropriation lies in the fact that recognition of the benefit or the equitable interest that arises out of the application to beneficial use of water is synonymous with the uses that are actually made.</text>

            <text syncTime="1200.671" offset="4955237">And what he did, for instance, was look to evidence that we presented which indicated in 1979 there was a net operating loss of $39,000 among the district's 63 farms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.608" offset="5002989">He took evidence like that and thought well, this economy is no good; therefore, it can't be injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.541" offset="5022633">What he fails to do is recognize that despite the fact that there was a $39,000 net operating loss, there were still paid in 1979 one million dollars in local and state taxes by those people; there were also mortgage payments being made, there were also farm implements still being bought, there were payments being made to local banks.</text>

            <text syncTime="1317.716" offset="5423352">Well, in 1978, as an example, in the Vermejo Conservancy District, they had no water to put on their lands because of the drought.</text>

            <text syncTime="1349.327" offset="5549784">Under the Constitution and laws of both states, you can't blame the farmer for drought conditions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1362.987" offset="5604433">Because it didn't rain, he has just killed off the users in New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.101" offset="5628883">Secondly, Colorado tried to throw out the whole bottom half of the river, the Canadian.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.305" offset="5665768">And what he has done... Colorado has tried to make it appear as if this were a closed basin somehow, and that water does not get on down to the Canadian River users.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.724" offset="5711430">Well, one of the glaring contradictions in Colorado's case here is when they went to Water Division 2, when CF&amp;I went to Water Division 2 in 1975 to get their inchoate water right in Colorado... this is 100 years after the river was fully appropriated downstream... they were thrown out of court initially because the jurisdictional embrace of the court in Colorado goes to the Arkansas River drainage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.279" offset="5809651">The judge sat in Alamosa, he looked to the East and saw the Arkansas, he looked to the South and saw the Vermejo and said, I don't have jurisdiction, that doesn't drain into the Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.166" offset="5849148">Well, CF&amp;I went back to court and vehemently petitioned the court, oh, yes, you do have jurisdiction because the Vermejo comes down here, it's tributary to the Canadian here, the Canadian turns east and flows on into Oklahoma, and over there it's tributary to the Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.606" offset="5914976">Well, that's how they got in court to get their water right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.257" offset="5925530">Now they turn around when they get into this Court and say the river stops when you get down to the Vermejo Conservancy District.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.453" offset="5954369">I think the evidence that impressed the Master in that regard was not the testimony of the farmers downstream that indicated that they rely on that water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.468" offset="5986343">It's not the legal fact that they have a property right in Vermejo water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.713" offset="6007345">It was the fact that in a certain 20-year period of record, only 6900 acre feet got past the Vermejo Conservancy District's point of diversion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.237" offset="6045484">Well, if you look at the 30-year period of records just prior to that, you'll find out that an average annual of 7,100 acre feet got down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.205" offset="6089370">I don't think it really makes any difference what the amount is.</text>

            <text syncTime="1849.815" offset="7551809">The first diversion across the state line from Colorado into New Mexico is the Vermejo Park Corporation which diverts enough water to irrigate 250 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.253" offset="7605517">It has a decreed right for 870 acres but hasn't been using that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.989" offset="7628504">The state engineer of New Mexico, Mr. Reynolds, the chief water official of that state, testified that that organization could, in fact, use more water than it had been using.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.044" offset="7676674">This relates to the question of the difference between decreed usage and actual usage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.838" offset="7699871">The next user down the stream is the Kaiser Steel Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.591" offset="7714917">The maximum amount they've used is 361 acre feet; that was in 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.165" offset="7737174">Since then, they have used less than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.256" offset="7745533">Going on down, there's the Phelps Dodge Corporation which has decreed rights for 500 acres, or 1000 acre feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.223" offset="7785448">The allocation is two acre feet per acre.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.676" offset="7799241">But Phelps Dodge, through a lessee, is irrigating only 150 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.386" offset="7818049">Again, New Mexico officials testified that they could use more water than they have been using.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.601" offset="7842917">There's been reference to a drought in the seventies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.473" offset="7854411">The figures really belie that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.594" offset="7862875">The Vermejo Conservancy District in the seventies irrigated 4,100 and some acres; in the sixties irrigated 4,500 and some acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.684" offset="7915224">The measured flow at the Dawson Gauge, which is the only measuring gauge on the river, was some 8000 in the seventies, some 11,000 in the sixties, some 9000 in the fifties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.132" offset="7969037">Now, this doesn't indicate a severe drought which caused this unreal situation that New Mexico suggests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.629" offset="8011042">Going down then, below the Phelps Dodge usage is the Vermejo Conservancy District diversion point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.746" offset="8047509">At that point, they have a canal that's capable of carrying 600 cubic feet per second.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.321" offset="8073840">Between that point and the district reservoirs, there are individual diverters that in recent years have been taking out approximately 500 to 600 acre feet of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.688" offset="8119293">So that you have no more than 1500 acre feet of actual usage between the state line and the district reservoirs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.704" offset="8155342">Between that diversion point of the district and the district reservoirs, according to the New Mexico chief witness, there's a 10 percent loss of water.</text>

            <text syncTime="2147.552" offset="8742679">New Mexico's Exhibit E3, which is perhaps the most important exhibit in the case, is a detailed engineering report as to the manner in which the district supplies stock water, water to the livestock of the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.873" offset="8812060">And this livestock system is simply an open ditch system whereby the water is released from the reservoirs and taken to the fields.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.990" offset="8856469">The livestock consume approximately 35 acre feet of water, but in order to get this 35 acre feet of water to the livestock there must be released from the reservoirs over 2000 acre feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.100" offset="8912893">So you can see there's about a 98 percent loss there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.390" offset="8926059">Now, the Exhibit E3 demonstrates that by a closed system which can be financed to a large extent by soil conservation assistance, Farm Home Administration assistance, that by a closed system this 2000 acre feet loss can be eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.234" offset="9013412">And not only will it be eliminated, but the district will benefit because they will get a domestic system as well as a stock water system, and the stock water will be available 12 months out of the year instead of 9 1/2 months out of the year, as it is now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.826" offset="9075793">The other two and a half months they have to haul the stock water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.958" offset="9088331">The reason for that is it's in the winter months when the ditches are frozen.</text>

            <text syncTime="3515.169" offset="14213242">In Connecticut versus Massachusetts, it was a matter of degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.419" offset="14222229">Sure, there was going to be some effect on the Connecticut River when the City of Boston took a tremendous quantity of water out of the river, and took it into the Merimac River, but the Court weighed the equities, and that is what this Court has said in prior cases, and I respectfully suggest that that is what the Special Master did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.121" offset="14308955">He said that Colorado is a sovereign state, and it has certain interests that are above and beyond the interests of its citizens, and above and beyond those that would obtain in a controversy between private parties, but he also found that there would be no material injury, and there were material injury, there would be countervailing... there are hard countervailing equities in favor of Colorado, and it is these countervailing equities, the Colorado need for water, that is a basic factor here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.505" offset="14438522">But as to the findings that this Court would have to make to enter its decree, I think that the Special Master's report has the basic considerations that he... that are the result of his evaluation of this very thorough record, and it would seem to me that they would be virtually sufficient, in view of the law that this Court has announced in its prior decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.114" offset="14560984">And this, of course, brings me to the last point that I wanted to make in this argument, and that is that the Special Master's report is very much in accord with these prior decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.654" offset="14623156">He considered all of the factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.866" offset="14636008">He properly rejected priority as the sole consideration, and here again, I would respectfully refer you to New Mexico's own brief in Arizona versus California, which refers to an equitable division of the benefits, and rejects the idea of priority regardless of state line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.861" offset="14736005">It was there referring, I believe, to the Wyoming versus Colorado case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3652.306" offset="14761709">What New Mexico and the amici really are seeking here, I suggest, is just that, priority regardless of state line, a rule of law based on these paper decrees, and those were sifted out, I suggest, by the Special Master.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.881" offset="14852093">I can't emphasize too strongly the difference between the laws of these two states, even though the follow the priority of appropriation doctrine, difference in administration, difference in... Colorado carries their water rights on the basis of historic use, actual use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3693.805" offset="14927744">The New Mexico officials testified, Mr. Compton and Mr. Reynolds, that New Mexico carries them on the basis of the decreed right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3701.239" offset="14957523">And this stock farm situation by impartial observers, so to speak, the Bureau of Reclamation officials, is a most serious matter which, if it existed in Colorado, would be alleviated, because Colorado law provides for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3716.750" offset="15019486">The Special Master did indeed consider benefit-detriment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3724.513" offset="15050624">This was first suggested in the first case, Kansas versus Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="3729.477" offset="15070477">It was reiterated in the most recent case, Nebraska versus Wyoming, and what he did, I suggest, was do just what Nebraska versus Wyoming told him to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3747.338" offset="15141843">He reached an informed judgment on the basis of many factors, rejecting the priority of appropriation as the sole consideration.</text>
