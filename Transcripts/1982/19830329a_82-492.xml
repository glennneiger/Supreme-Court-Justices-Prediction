            <text syncTime="6.840" offset="170425">Mr. Attorney General, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

          <turn speaker="mark_v_meierhenry" startTime="57.101" stopTime="305.161">
            <label>Mr. Mark V. Meierhenry</label>
            <text syncTime="57.101" offset="371463">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this is a case from the Eighth Circuit that basically began three years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.678" offset="397795">Three years ago, a man by the name of Jerry Helm appeared before a Circuit Court Judge within the state of South Dakota and pled guilty to a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.628" offset="433635">That felony happened to be his seventh felony within 15 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.172" offset="451816">Judge Parker in that case, and the state of South Dakota had filed prior to that time its habitual criminal statute and the defendant pled guilty to be a habitual criminal and he was sentenced to life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.321" offset="524436">The state of South Dakota contends that two recent decisions of this Court take care of this situation and have affirmatively stated that this is a permissible sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.285" offset="576263">Those two cases, Hutto versus Davis and Rummel versus Estelle, in our opinion were ignored by the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.625" offset="605625">The Eighth Circuit reversed the District Court within South Dakota after it had upheld the state of South Dakota Supreme Court's decision, which decided this was a permissible sentence and it did not violate the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.198" offset="663930">The state of South Dakota petitioned for writ of certiorari, was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.322" offset="688381">The question before this Court is whether a statutorily-authorized sentence of life imprisonment without parole but with the right of commutation for a non-violent habitual offender's seventh felony constitutes cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.800" offset="754314">Mr. Helm has been an active criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.285" offset="764240">He is certainly an habitual criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.783" offset="770196">He has been convicted three times of burglary... in 1964, '66, and '69; of obtaining money under false pretenses in '72; of grand larceny in '73; a third offense, driving while intoxicated, which requires three offenses within four years, by the way, in 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.415" offset="852743">The basic crime for which this case rests on was writing a no-account check, which is a felony in South Dakota, as in most other states, and it was for the amount of $100.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.458" offset="900913">South Dakota's habitual offender statute, we have two.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.269" offset="920139">One is for the first and second felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.206" offset="931946">It allows a circuit court judge to basically double whatever the statutory sentence is.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.329" offset="952426">When an individual commits their fourth sentence, our court or our circuit court can sentence an individual anywhere from one day to life.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.887" offset="990670">In this particular case he was given life imprisonment and, as is pointed out in the briefs, in South Dakota life imprisonment requires that the governor commute that to a term of years prior to the time that parole begins.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.897" offset="1050647">We submit that this Court has decided this case in Rummel versus Estelle.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.332" offset="1072381">It is just like the state of Texas, only in effect a mirror image.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.253" offset="1088159">In Texas, the parole board allows a parole, it must be approved by the governor.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.202" offset="1115953">Ours is the other way around, that the governor must first commute it to a term of years, then assigns it to the parole board.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.948" offset="1150853">I also want to point out that the state of South Dakota is more lenient than Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.525" offset="1169243">Texas requires, the legislature requires, a mandatory life sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.304" offset="1188364">Here it is left to the discretion of the sentencing judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.662" offset="1205710">These two cases... I might point out that in this case, as in the Rummel case, the defendant does not challenge the habitual criminal statute of South Dakota, nor does he contend that that statute is unfairly or unconstitutionally applied as to his client.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.780" offset="1278226">He simply states that this is cruel and unusual punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.919" offset="1294735">The Eighth Circuit, at the oral argument, noted that this life sentence for this individual on his seventh felony within 15 years was a black day in legal jurisprudence and that it was... it eventually held that it was cruel and unusual.</text>

            <label>Justice Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="305.161" offset="1363698">Attorney General, you mentioned about this life imprisonment and parole.</text>

            <text syncTime="313.658" offset="1397762">The... but under... in the state of South Dakota, and I think the appendix to the brief shows that, about 50 percent of the time those people who get life sentences are paroled, or at least over the period that the Eighth Circuit asked for the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.480" offset="1457008">The process in South Dakota, and I think you can see that in the lower judges' statements to the defendant, that an individual--</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark V. Meierhenry</label>
            <text syncTime="339.023" offset="1499222">--Well, an individual can be commuted and in South Dakota that's the normal process.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.380" offset="1516671">For example, in Texas they have a little different procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.879" offset="1534644">There the Board of Pardons and Paroles acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.533" offset="1545197">Then the governor must approve their actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.095" offset="1555437">In our state, if someone gets a life sentence there is a series of requests for commutation.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.952" offset="1582918">If the individual is a man like Mr. Helm, maybe eventually the governor will be convinced he's rehabilitated himself in prison, will commute his sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.479" offset="1625027">Once it's commuted to a term of years, it then is just like any other individual in the state penitentiary.</text>

            <text syncTime="376.273" offset="1648224">Well, is this to say that every sentence which is just a life sentence remains without possibility of parole unless the governor commutes?</text>

            <text syncTime="386.723" offset="1690020">Once the governor commutes it to a term of years, whether it's ten years or 40 years--</text>

            <text syncTime="396.812" offset="1730353">--Well, anything that's a Class 1 felony in South Dakota, which would include murder, rape... the more serious offenses, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.105" offset="1763476">And, of course, this habitual offender becomes a Class 1 felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.369" offset="1788554">For example, if, like in Hutto versus Davis, the judge would have given Mr. Helm 40 years, under the rules of South Dakota, he would have, before he's eligible for parole, would have to serve 30 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.410" offset="1840694">In other words, he would have gotten out of prison when he was 66, 70 years old, assuming that he had done things properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.173" offset="1867757">So it's our view or the state of South Dakota's view that this Court has already decided this factual situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.795" offset="1898268">It's determined that there's a difference between the death penalty and any term of years, and in this case a life sentence is simply a term of years measured by an individual's life.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.321" offset="1944348">This Court also discussed, and other courts have discussed, the possibility of parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.006" offset="1967127">You have it in this case, only it's not called parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.020" offset="1979143">It's called commutation.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.677" offset="1985831">In both instances it is executive leniency.</text>

            <text syncTime="467.908" offset="2014774">It's really routinely given to a very significant number of people, whereas here nobody's gotten it for the last ten or 12 years, as I understand it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1080.991" offset="4467045">Before he even started on this trail, a prosecutor had to make a decision to charge him with an habitual offender offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.174" offset="4499751">A circuit court judge in our state had to decide that this man could only, and society could only be protected by this punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.311" offset="4540397">The state of South Dakota Supreme Court held three-to-two... it was a close question there... that this was appropriate for Mr. Helm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.043" offset="4571222">And I think in each case, for example, the Supreme Court of the state of South Dakota, understands and is aware that 50 percent of the time people who get life imprisonment in South Dakota, or approximately 50 percent, are commuted by the governor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.444" offset="4620854">Ours is not a state known for long sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.879" offset="4634647">Ours is not a state that executive clemency is never used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.410" offset="4652724">In Texas it was denied, according to the report I read, 79 percent of the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.406" offset="4672681">That's certainly not the indication in South Dakota, and yet this Court has held prior to this time it was acceptable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.358" offset="4700580">We would simply ask that this Court follow, as we clearly read Rummel and as later the per curiam in Hutto versus Davis held, that this is a felony, that it is up to the legislature of the State of South Dakota to determine what is a proper punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.366" offset="4772573">There is no allegation whatsoever that this man in any way will be treated cruelly or unusually in our state penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.519" offset="4805174">He'll be cared for properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.065" offset="4811339">He'll be fed properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.596" offset="4817504">So it's only a matter of years, and certainly if in Hutto versus Davis 40 years for nine ounces of marijuana is acceptable, in this instance, after six felonies and on the seventh felony, and only then, that this individual be given the sentence of life imprisonment in South Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.400" offset="4896707">We think that any other decision would be a subjective decision and that the legislature of South Dakota has appropriately made this decision, as did the Circuit Court of South Dakota, as did the Supreme Court of South Dakota, to protect us from thieves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.285" offset="4960237">I don't think we want violent people in our society.</text>

            <text syncTime="1219.825" offset="5022409">One can cause a lot of damage and I think that Jerry Helm is where he should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.073" offset="5043411">I don't think he was treated unfairly or too cruelly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.103" offset="5059502">If you can't learn in six times, seven times, in our society, I don't know that the populace of this country want to put up with these individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.553" offset="5093357">If he reforms, and I'm sure he went through AA every time he was in prison, I'm sure he went to church every time he was in prison and joined the Jaycees every time he was in prison, and was reformed, and I'm sure he'll get out again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.907" offset="5138706">But we need not under the Eighth Amendment declare it cruel and unusual to have a man who is certainly unusual in and of himself... seven felony convictions within 15 years and only 36 or 37 years old.</text>

Estelle, this Court did uphold the life sentence on a Texas recidivist convicted of three prior felonies, but in Rummel this Court refrained from applying the proportionality principle espoused in the cases of Coker v. Georgia, and Weems v. United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.576" offset="5797409">Now the reason this Court felt compelled to hold back from applying a proportionality analysis in that case was because the punishments involved in Weems and Coker could be clearly distinguished, a bright line could be drawn between those punishments and traditional forms of imprisonment, while no such bright line could be drawn between Rummel's punishment and traditional forms of imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.206" offset="5899914">In this case, there is no such fear of a more extensive intrusion into the line-drawing process of the legislature, as there was in Rummel, because a bright line can be drawn in this case and between traditional forms of imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.107" offset="5967519">In Rummel, Your Honor, this Court, in distinguishing his sentence from the death penalty involved in Coker, quoted Justice Stewart in Furman v. Georgia to the effect that the penalty of death differs in kind from other forms of punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.879" offset="6042647">It is unique in its total irrevocability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.223" offset="6051946">It is unique in its rejection of rehabilitation as a basic goal of criminal justice, and it is unique in its absolute renunciation of all that is embodied in our concept of humanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.265" offset="6096146">Now those points brought out by Justice Stewart's opinion, quoted in Rummel, Rummel's sentence was distinguishable from the death penalty on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.337" offset="6156436">His eligibility for parole in 12 years meant that his sentence was not irrevocable and his eligibility for parole in less than 12 years meant that his sentence did not reject his rehabilitation completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.817" offset="6202412">However, Mr. Helm is never eligible under South Dakota law for parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.173" offset="6227803">Consequently, his sentence of life imprisonment means he will be sentenced to life imprisonment unless there is the extremely unlikely possibility that the governor of South Dakota or one of the governors of South Dakota, who have not commuted a single life sentence since 1975, will somehow decide to commute his sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.820" offset="6314425">Consequently, his sentence approaches irrevocability of the death penalty, since his imprisonment for life cannot even be revoked by the possibility of parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.784" offset="6362281">Also, his sentence rejects his rehabilitation completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.877" offset="6378582">I don't think there's any way anybody could argue a life sentence without parole is a sentence based or considers rehabilitation at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="2082.525" offset="8473184">Therefore, for the Court to say that his punishment was unconstitutional would involve the Court in the line-drawing process, preeminently the province of the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.317" offset="8516338">Therefore, the Court in Rummel distinguished Rummel's sentence from the death penalty in Coker.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.345" offset="8536505">The reason that this case is different than Rummel and Rummel does not apply to this case is because when you're talking about life imprisonment without parole you are not talking about a sentence that's clearly distinguishable from the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.044" offset="8587287">You're talking about a sentence that approaches the irrevocability of a death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.760" offset="8606095">You're talking about a sentence that rejects rehabilitation completely, as the death penalty does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.399" offset="8628665">So for that reason the Court's fear in applying the proportionality analysis of intruding more extensively than was required in Weems and in Coker into the line-drawing process is not present in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.812" offset="8706301">So the reason that Rummel did not decide this case is because that fear in Rummel is not present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.246" offset="8740051">Now Coker v. Georgia, when it talked about the objective factors... and I think it was pointed out in Rummel... that there was a certain degree of subjectivity involved in at least two of the objective factors that were argued in Rummel and that are argued here... the nature of the offense and the interjurisdictional comparisons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.253" offset="8832106">In Coker v. Georgia, this Court said to the maximum extent possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.690" offset="8849870">Also, in Coker v. Georgia, it was stated that objective factors cannot determine this controversy entirely, for the Constitution contemplates our own judgment should be brought to bear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.731" offset="8889994">Now what... I'm telling Your Honors that interjurisdictional comparison does indicate by itself that the sentence in this case is unconstitutional, disproportionate to the punishment compared to every other state in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.506" offset="8953106">Number two, analyzing that with the two other objective factors, which also indicate that his sentence is grossly disproportionate to the punishment, those three objective factors, utilizing them, do indicate--</text>

            <text syncTime="3130.037" offset="12663225">I would call the Court's attention to the appendix, specifically page 22.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.113" offset="12683600">I think by reviewing the appendix, wherein the 45 individuals who are serving life for all sorts of crimes in South Dakota are listed, you will see that this idea that was mentioned in my colleague's argument that South Dakota is overly harsh is just not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.231" offset="12756012">We only have three individuals in our entire penitentiary who have been there over 23 years, so I think that... that it's fairly clear that most people, even if they murder, maim and rape people, do not spend all of their natural lives in the South Dakota penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.350" offset="12824453">Additionally, I'd like to point out that from the record that in 1975 this man Helm was convicted of driving while intoxicated, third offense, which means three within four years.</text>
