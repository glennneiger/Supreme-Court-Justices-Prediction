            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="92291">In the second case, Number 81-825, the Pillsbury Company against Conboy, this case presents a question involving the Fifth Amendment privilege against self incrimination and the federal statute that authorizes the granting of use immunity or testimony that otherwise would be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.861" offset="199707">As an extended oral summary of the case would not be informative, I will merely frame the question and state our disposition of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.666" offset="238890">Respondent had been granted use immunity for his grand jury testimony in a criminal antitrust case.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.825" offset="271491">Subsequently, a civil suit was brought by the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.099" offset="288627">They sought to have respondent, when taking his deposition, repeat verbatim or closely track his prior immunized testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.392" offset="333767">Respondent claimed the Fifth Amendment privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.461" offset="346097">The District Court rejected the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.739" offset="359158">The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.698" offset="379011">It held that the prior immunity did not carry over to the civil deposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.352" offset="405656">We affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.237" offset="417150">We hold in the absence of a duly authorized grant of immunity at the time that respondent could not be compelled over a valid Fifth Amendment claim to repeat his earlier testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.336" offset="477545">Our reasoning for these conclusions are set forth fully in an opinion filed this morning with the clerk.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.031" offset="512340">Justice Marshall has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.594" offset="526655">Justices Brennan and Blackmun have filed opinions concurring in the judgment and Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion joined by Justice O'Connor.</text>
