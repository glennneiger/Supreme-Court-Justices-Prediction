            <text syncTime="84.237" offset="479665">Chief Justice, may it please the Court, this case concerns Xerox copiers that were always in foreign commerce, never in domestic commerce or part of the common mass of property in the state of Texas, paused only temporarily in Texas, and were stored in a Customs bonded warehouse, always under the custody and control of the United States Customs Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.285" offset="583841">The issue is whether Texas can assert property taxes without violating the commerce clause and the import export clause on goods in that warehouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.826" offset="626055">The Texas Court of Civil Appeals said that it could.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.564" offset="644968">It was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.080" offset="655103">The facts are essentially undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.699" offset="665552">Xerox manufactures copiers domestically and assembles them abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.586" offset="685092">The Latin American Free Trade Association requires the assembly of goods in member countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.674" offset="713409">As a result, Xerox decided to build copiers in Mexico to compete in Latin America.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.077" offset="739009">Initially, it stored those copiers in the Panama Canal Zone, but because of anti-American feeling there, it sought to store them elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.535" offset="780909">It decided to switch to a Customs bonded warehouse in Houston.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.105" offset="799195">Physically, these copiers were assembled in Mexico, trucked by a bonded carrier to Houston, stored in a Customs bonded warehouse in Houston, anywhere from a few days to three years, but always less than the time permitted by the Customs statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.365" offset="868158">As orders were received, the copiers were trucked by a bonded carrier to the ship, and then to Latin America.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.070" offset="903058">Because of the way the copiers were packaged and built, they could not be used domestically.</text>

            <text syncTime="3524.720" offset="14241598">Xerox is well aware of the benefits, and can well appreciate the benefits provided by the State of Texas.</text>
