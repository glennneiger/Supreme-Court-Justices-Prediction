            <text syncTime="76.903" offset="451291">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the principal issue in this case is whether as a matter of federal constitutional law the state prosecution is entitled to show that a constitutional error in an unobjected to portion of a lengthy, detailed, and elaborate jury instruction is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.112" offset="556199">In 1981, the Connecticut Supreme Court foreclosed the prosecution that opportunity by automatically reversing the Respondent's 1976 convictions on attempted murder and robbery after finding Sandstrom error.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.043" offset="631850">That finding of Sandstrom error was premised solely on the court's use of the word "conclusively" twice, and the balance of the instructions were in fact described by the Connecticut Supreme Court as</text>
            <text syncTime="138.835" offset="699037">"precise, elaborate, and cast in highly permissive language. "</text>
            <text syncTime="143.269" offset="716800">and the Connecticut Supreme Court also found that if the word "conclusively" had not been used in this jury instruction, it would not have found Sandstrom error.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.044" offset="763925">The state maintains that a finding of an arguably conclusive presumption did not warrant automatic reversal in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.429" offset="813453">Furthermore, the state of Connecticut maintains that a reviewing court can determine the impact of an unconstitutional jury instruction on the verdict, and that in this case, because the instruction could have no impact on the outcome of the case, the instruction was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.390" offset="913241">The Respondent in this case was charged with four crimes that took place on Saturday night and early Sunday morning of December 20th and 21st, 1975, the weekend before Christmas.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.118" offset="972173">It is not necessary to repeat to this Court the sordid details of the rape and the kidnapping aspects of this case, because they are not before this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="230.437" offset="1065482">The Connecticut Supreme Court decided the case in 1981 principally because there were problems in obtaining the complete transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.276" offset="1104875">In fact, most of the trial transcript had been obtained in 1977 and 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.196" offset="1136536">Then it was discovered that there were portions missing.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.616" offset="1150224">Those portions involved the hearing on the motion to suppress.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.597" offset="1166106">In this case, there were initially five defendants, and some of the hearings on the motions to suppress were conducted jointly with other defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.811" offset="1206962">The last portion of transcript involving the motion to suppress was received by counsel on November 26th, 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.262" offset="1236741">The case was then rapidly briefed and argued in June of 1981 under a special briefing schedule that the Connecticut Supreme Court had set up.</text>

            <text syncTime="298.110" offset="1336216">I think the length of the delay in this case was somewhat... extremely unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.467" offset="1369548">In this case, the victim clearly had ample opportunity in over five and a half hours of being with the Respondent and his five companions to view them.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.292" offset="1420852">In fact, in the course of her testimony before the trial court, she was able to give clear identification of the Respondent and his co-assailants by details of clothing and physical description.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.643" offset="1486263">It was also undisputed that the Respondent was the leader of the group, that he initiated the incident, that he took the most active role, and that he was the most vicious, that he gave directions, that he restrained the victim, that he threatened her, and that he was the first one to rape her.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.385" offset="1557316">The crucial facts, I believe, before the Court are those that are surrounding the robbery and the attempted murder, and I will concentrate this afternoon on the facts surrounding the attempted murder because in my opinion, and the Respondent virtually concedes that there was overwhelming evidence of intent necessary for robbery by not even discussing those facts in his brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="479.272" offset="2060852">Subsequently, in a decision of March 30th, 1982, State against Kervin, the Connecticut Supreme Court appeared to be moving towards this Court's total record review analysis in determining whether a jury charge could be harmful.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.032" offset="2139847">In that case, they specifically emphasized that the charge should not be examined in a vacuum, that it should be viewed in the context of the factual issues raised at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.821" offset="2183001">The challenge in that case was premised on Sandstrom and based on a claim that an elemental portion of one of the offenses was improperly given.</text>

            <text syncTime="2064.887" offset="8403278">A verdict is a judgment of law rendered by a court of laymen, and I think that that language explains why this Court has treated incidents of instructional error differently than it has treated incidents of evidentiary error.</text>

            <text syncTime="2098.579" offset="8538070">My suggestion is that although Petitioner has not placed much emphasis on the word "conclusively", that when the Connecticut Supreme Court said that the convictions had to be overturned because the word "conclusively" was used, "conclusively" became more than a word, and I think the decision of the State Supreme Court shows that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.035" offset="8639843">"Conclusively" became a concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.799" offset="8650919">The Connecticut Supreme Court overturned these convictions because in its opinion this instruction withdrew the element of intent from the jury's factfinding function insofar as attempted murder, where it was specifically stated for the second time, and insofar as the crime of robbery was concerned, where nothing was stated as to how the element of intent should be ascertained, and it became a sort of guessing game between the invalid presumption and the subsequent mention of inference in the kidnapping instructions, and by taking it from the factfinding function of the jury, by effectively eliminating intent as an element of the crime, what has been done is that the factual elements of the crime have been taken from the decision of the only body which is constitutionally able to make that decision, namely, the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.850" offset="8915174">And in brief, my position here today is that the invalid presumption amounted to a directed verdict.</text>

            <text syncTime="2339.338" offset="9501048">I refer to Justice Brennan's concurrence in Chiarella versus United States, which is cited in both briefs, that where it... where the error is evidentiary, apparently from the nature of the violation, the material is admitted improperly for the jury's factfinding determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.764" offset="9610762">Therefore, on review, a court can eliminate that tainted item and make a determination of what impact it had upon the jury, and furthermore, in evidentiary matter, the jury, of course, is told that it is the supreme judge of facts, it may accept or reject any evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.659" offset="9726328">When it comes to instructional error, the jury has no choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.456" offset="9745554">The jury is always told that it has a duty to abide by the instructions given to it by the court, and I believe that this Court has said that the crucial assumption behind the constitutional scheme of trial by jury is that the jury will listen, follow, and obey the instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.945" offset="9835520">So therefore in the case of instructional error, you must start with the proposition that the error had an impact on the jury in the sense that they understood and followed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2584.157" offset="10480327">For kidnapping in the second degree, the second charge in the information, the court felt that the error was cured by the permissive inference language that attended the description on how intent should be ascertained for that crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.884" offset="10555246">On the third charge, robbery in the first degree, the court went to great lengths in describing the nature of the intent, but it never described how the intent should be ascertained, so the jury was left with two specific instructions which could be construed as at variance with each other, the attempted murder, admittedly invalid, and the kidnapping, admittedly valid, plus the general instruction which had been made common to all crimes, and in the Truppi case, which is referred to in a footnote in my brief, this procedure is set forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.789" offset="10746880">The Connecticut Supreme Court in the Truppi case held that by giving a general instruction on intent, the jury would interpret that general instruction every time the court mentioned intent.</text>

            <text syncTime="3172.652" offset="12834377">The harmless error rule in Connecticut for criminal cases generally revolves about a case called the State v. Evans, which is cited in the respondent's brief in the section which explains how the error was considered below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.330" offset="12913058">State v. Evans rests on two premises: the Connecticut Supreme Court will consider on a plain error basis claims where error was not claimed at the trial level when a newly articulated constitutional position is announced by this Court and where the record shows that the petitioner may have been deprived of a fair trial because of denial of constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.063" offset="13075958">And in this case the decision notes that they have accepted claims made on the basis that this Court's decision in Sandstrom v. Montana.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.311" offset="13117022">But they have never ruled on a case where the claim of error involved an instruction stated conclusively as this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.789" offset="13158922">Subsequently, in Turcio v. Manson in a habeas corpus case, convictions were reversed.</text>
