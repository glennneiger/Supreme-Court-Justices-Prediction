            <text syncTime="14.713" offset="203740">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, this is a suit to enforce the Pecos River Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.626" offset="235400">Texas and New Mexico intended the Compact to equitably apportion the waters of the Pecos River between the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.002" offset="276883">The Compact contemplates continuing administration of the Pecos River in conformity with the terms of the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.677" offset="311573">The Compact imposes upon New Mexico, the upstream state, the obligation not to deplete by man's activities the state line flow below that available to Texas under the 1947 condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.753" offset="391821">The controversy between the states as to the meaning of the 1947 condition precipitated this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.817" offset="424109">The Special Master rejected the conflicting contentions of the states concerning the 1947 condition and defined the 1947 condition in his 1979 report.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.647" offset="487430">His 1979 report was confirmed in all respects and his definition of the 1947 condition was approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.645" offset="531420">Since that time, we have been attempting to translate the definition of the 1947 condition into water quantities to provide a numerical standard by which compliance can be measured.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.097" offset="617206">The states disagree as to the procedure to implement the definition of the 1947 condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.414" offset="654509">As a result, numerous hearings have been held and the Master has issued his report and recommendations.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.280" offset="681990">The Master has recommended that the New Mexico motion to dismiss the suit be denied, that the Texas motion to substitute the double mass analysis for the river routing as the accounting procedure be denied--</text>

            <text syncTime="157.634" offset="775403">Also, he recommended that the United States representative on the Pecos Commission or some third party be vested with the power to participate in Commission deliberations and to vote when the states are not able to agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.115" offset="845307">He then recommended that the matter should be returned to the Commission for the performance by it of its duties and that the Court retain jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="210.989" offset="988772">It's... the Master found the double mass to be an accounting procedure useful in the inflow-outflow method.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.189" offset="1033598">However, he was concerned about some language that the engineer advisors to the Compact negotiators used in their report, and based on their statement the allocation shouldn't be based on a straight line he felt it was not proper for him to use the double mass.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.443" offset="1110607">Texas contends that Texas has addressed the concerns of the engineer advisors and that double mass is based upon a curvolinear basis as opposed to straight-line percentage.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.011" offset="1164941">Texas believes that the Master has not rejected the double mass on its merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.345" offset="1190228">He... there are not sufficient findings in his report to reach that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.538" offset="1211021">The primary position of Texas is that this suit not be dismissed and that the Court retain jurisdiction so that the disputes between the states may be resolved by whatever means the Court deems appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.300" offset="1282074">If the suit is dismissed, Texas' only alternative is to take... to try to take steps to institute an equitable apportionment of the waters of the Pecos River between the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.364" offset="1362323">However, Article XIV of the Compact provides that it takes the action of the legislatures of both states to terminate the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.642" offset="1407462">So this Compact provision may prevent Texas from seeking the remedy of equitable apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.938" offset="1444661">However, Texas believes that this Court has jurisdiction to continue the suit to a complete resolve of the disputes concerning the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.645" offset="1495443">Texas accepted the Master's recommendation that a tie-breaker vote be placed upon the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.103" offset="1537239">This was not a Texas idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.416" offset="1550509">Texas has never argued this, but Texas accepted that as a practical solution to an ongoing problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.729" offset="1579766">Because this is not a Texas idea, we prefer to rely upon the argument of the Master contained in his report for support of that recommendation.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.268" offset="1629921">Texas would like to move to its alternative exceptions in the event the Court does not accept the Master's recommendation that a tie-breaker vote be placed upon the Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="1223.638" offset="5039423">What also is contained in the report of the engineer advisors is a river routing study that is what we have been referring to throughout as the S.D. 109 river routing, which produced the Plate 2 standard of measurement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.702" offset="5119671">In the 1979 report, the Master found that river routing to be incorrect, inconsistent and contained omissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.220" offset="5169722">Therefore, he held that river routing to be a nullity and that is why he defined the 1947 condition in the terms that this Court approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.098" offset="5217265">So when you revert... the Compact specifically says that the 1947 condition is that situation described and defined in the report of the engineer advisors, just like the language in Article VI.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.018" offset="5276928">So by the Master's early ruling, he has made that phrase, as described and defined in reference to the river routing, a nullity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.544" offset="5319038">There is a void at that point and Texas contends that the controlling language is 149 of S.D. 109, and that is where the statement is that the inflow-outflow method involves the determination that the correlation between the upstream... or the index of the inflow and outflow from the basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.723" offset="5431782">Texas contends that if the Court were to remand it back to the Master to proceed, then he is left with the choice as to any inflow-outflow method to depict the 1947 condition and is not restricted to a river routing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.764" offset="5559887">Texas proposed the inflow-outflow method because the Master repeatedly expressed his concerns about the river routing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.820" offset="5600115">The river routing has too many, he continually said, the river routing has too many unmeasured values, too many judgment-dependent techniques.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.048" offset="5645046">That has caused the problem between the states and he was... expressed his desire that some other method could be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.153" offset="5677438">Texas proposed the double mass.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.663" offset="5683498">The double mass eliminates the judgment-dependent techniques and eliminates the unmeasured values.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.680" offset="5715576">And with that understanding Texas proposed this as a solution and a superior method to the laborious river routing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.780" offset="5775972">The Pecos... in regard to the claim that continuation of the suit would require this Court to perform administrative functions, Texas replies that this is not... this is a suit to enforce the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.797" offset="5880043">This is a suit to enforce Federal rights that are created by the Compact, since it is the law of the Union, and that it is completely a judicial function to determine those rights, even though it may require making those difficult decisions concerning the engineering procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.051" offset="5973039">Texas submits that this process is easier than the difficult processes involved in an equitable apportionment suit, because the Compact limits your inquiry to a certain extent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1991.263" offset="8109960">The next method continues until the Commission changes it again, and the Compact does not envision adoption of a method to be applied only for a limited period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.209" offset="8149666">It is an ongoing administrative measure, a technique, and in fact, when you look at what the Commission did here, the Commission did not say we adopt the review of basic data to be used for findings of fact for a 12-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.271" offset="8217898">They had worked a decade making the corrections in the review of basic data so that the routing method could work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.296" offset="8246006">After they worked a decade, they said we adopt it for use in all actions and findings, for all actions and findings of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.951" offset="8284667">And then they went on, clearly explaining their intention to use it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.105" offset="8301281">They told the Committees to go ahead and prepare the next set of findings and prepare a draft inflow-outflow manual, both based on the review of basic data.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.871" offset="8348301">So the Master erred when he said that the review of basic data was intended to be used only until 1962 and certainly the first eight years of this litigation indicate that everyone understood that the review of basic data was still the subject of this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.483" offset="8418832">It was... the entire pre-trial order is written toward the early phases, the question whether the Commission acted within its authority to adopt it, and then whether certain technical portions are valid.</text>

            <text syncTime="2753.291" offset="11158032">Part of the problem is the issue of unanimity, and the Court has indicated a concern as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.326" offset="11186140">What does unanimity do here?</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.647" offset="11195439">Why is it in the Compact?</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.070" offset="11201186">Isn't it going to create distortions in the way these compacts work?</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.310" offset="11218114">And perhaps I can take just a moment to discuss the two reasons for having unanimity in the Compact and then discuss a worst case situation... what happens if the states simply do not agree when you get back to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.181" offset="11277568">The obvious reason for having a unanimity requirement in the Compact and, as counsel for Texas correctly pointed out, that's a common requirement in interstate water compacts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.808" offset="11324066">But the common reason is that the states here are delegating to an administrative body the authority to make decisions that will affect those states in the future, and they will agree to do this interstate cooperation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.347" offset="11382267">It is in everyone's interest, but at the same time they want to protect their citizens and their sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.752" offset="11407867">So the way that they retain control of the obvious state protection is in this unanimity requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.618" offset="11435348">The delegation here to the Commission was unusual for its time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.340" offset="11454261">In its day, it was unusual to have a commission given the authority to change the method for administering the compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.447" offset="11486652">So one can see that the states had some concern that they not be bound in ten or 20 or 50 years by something they have no say over.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.331" offset="11526150">The other reason for unanimity requirement is one suggested by the scholars in the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.074" offset="11549137">Interstate relations are different from other kinds of relations, and to the extent that they succeed, they succeed on the basis of cooperation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.803" offset="11592083">So what compacts try to do when they require unanimity is to set up a way that the compact will work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.768" offset="11623952">Now Texas has said that there's no enforcement mechanism here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.611" offset="11639312">The legislative history in Senate Document 109 at page 124 indicates that it was anticipated that when the states came to a finding the upstream state, New Mexico, if it was not delivering sufficient water, would then proceed voluntarily, without any court enforcement, to go and make the necessary decisions under the Compact to shut certain users down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.666" offset="11739518">The unanimity requirement is tied with other measures to push the states to come to such agreement, and the measures here are the binding nature of the compact and the difficulty of getting out of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3178.651" offset="12859439">The difference here... we had a term to be interpreted there, a 1947 condition, and there was a question of when it began and whether it was a real or artificial condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.418" offset="12906564">Did it begin on December 1, December 30, March 20?</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.452" offset="12922656">Was it a condition that was meant to be reflected on the river, or was it a condition technically defined somewhere regardless of what the real condition was?</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.759" offset="12959854">So there the Court was defining a particular term.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.161" offset="12977513">The difference here is that Texas is asking the Court not to define a particular term in a statute but go to into uncharted areas and regardless of what the Compact requires require a tie-breaker or require a new method or make certain findings that are delegated to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.903" offset="13052432">So it's not a matter of interpreting, which is a standard judicial function.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.005" offset="13068837">It is a matter of taking on the entire administration of the Compact and rewriting it, as Texas sees fit as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.081" offset="13105199">So that is the basic dichotomy in the presentation of the two states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.405" offset="13122440">It's two completely different ways of... two completely different ideas of what the Court's role should be in interstate compact commission disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.253" offset="13169879">New Mexico asks the Court not to take that broader role and throw itself into the suit as if this were an equitable apportionment suit, when it is in fact a compact suit, to recognize that the states agreed to shoulder that responsibility under the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.373" offset="13246365">They agreed to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.246" offset="13253888">They agreed that the Compact would be binding and that agreement is something which New Mexico, as I indicated before, has tried to honor through all the years of this dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.074" offset="13301118">New Mexico asks the Court to put this case back on course first by recognizing the binding nature of the interstate Compact, secondly by giving structure and form to judicial review in interstate compact commission cases and, third, by returning the appropriate responsibility to the administrative compact... by returning the responsibility under the Compact to the appropriate administrative body, which is the Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="3339.007" offset="13500902">This is not a suit to review administrative actions, and I believe counsel for New Mexico misspoke herself about the Compact providing for a review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.896" offset="13560461">It clearly states that the findings of fact made by the Commission shall not be conclusive in any court but shall constitute prima facie evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.714" offset="13607691">That is not the language used in the conventional standard of review, the conventional standard of review being that the administrative decisions are conclusive if they are supported by substantial evidence and not the result of arbitrary and capricious actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.767" offset="13679893">That is the standard that New Mexico is trying to impose upon this particular Compact, and this Compact Commission is quite different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.073" offset="13725137">First, it's not a Federal agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.653" offset="13731511">Second, it does not use the language of... the conventional language of substantial evidence review.</text>
