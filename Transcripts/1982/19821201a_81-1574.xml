            <text syncTime="108.141" offset="573414">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the procedural history of this case is set out at Pages 2 through 6 of our brief, the blue brief, and I will very briefly summarize that history.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.211" offset="673724">This matter began when Mr. Jones filed a charge with the Atlanta Regional Office of the National Labor Relations Board against Local 926 of the Operating Engineers.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.390" offset="746449">The language of the charge is set out at Pages 2 and 3 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.903" offset="780513">The allegation is that the union violated Sections 8(b)(1)(A) and 8(b)(1)(B) of the National Labor Relations Act as amended, the sections prohibiting certain forms of restraint and coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.144" offset="857418">The regional director investigated that charge and issued a letter opinion stating that he would not file a complaint--</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="198.793" offset="936098">Mr. Gold, is it possible to tell from that letter whether or not he took his action on the basis of no evidence, or that it was the type of thing that the board didn't go into?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="laurence_gold" startTime="209.649" stopTime="282.086">
            <label>Mr. Laurence Gold</label>
            <text syncTime="209.649" offset="979462">--It appears to us from the language he used that he found the evidence insufficient to find that the union had caused the discharge, that he found the evidence insufficient to find that the union had restrained or coerced the employer, that he found that the union had participated in discussions with the employer concerning who should be a supervisor on this job, and all of these questions are of the very essence of Section 8(b)(1), and what is designedly left unregulated and is permitted by Section 8(b)(1) so that it would be our view that he was not taking the position, this is none of our business, but rather, was taking the position that this was not the type of activity which warranted the issuance of a complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="289.445" offset="1298678">The next point I was going to make is that the board, as this Court has recognized, has adopted a very rigorous internal system of determining when to exercise prosecutorial discretion on behalf of charging parties, and that includes not only an investigation and determination at the regional level, but a review at the national level.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.339" offset="1406198">The last line of the regional director's decision here is that Form NLRB 4938, Procedure for Filing an Appeal, is attached.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.489" offset="1466802">The appeal period expires at the close of business on August 1, 1978, and no appeal was taken.</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence Gold</label>
            <text syncTime="341.516" offset="1506926">The... I think the short answer under the decisions is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.075" offset="1533153">The courts of appeals are uniform that there is no jurisdiction in the courts to review the general counsel's exercise of his authority to institute complaints any more than there is to review a United States Attorney's determination not to prosecute an alleged crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.111" offset="1637329">Rather than going to the NLRB general counsel, the... Mr. Jones went to the state courts of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.310" offset="1686126">He filed a lawsuit alleging that the union had violated the Georgia law prohibiting tortious interference with employment relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.710" offset="1759687">The complaint which begins by alleging that he had been a union member and had dropped his union membership, and goes on to allege this interference with employment relationships, is set out at Pages 4 and 5 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.435" offset="1838577">He also sued the employer, and in addition he alleged a violation of the Georgia right to work law.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.932" offset="1880582">All parties moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that this is the type of matter within the exclusive jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board under the Garmon Rule articulated by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.797" offset="1956023">The trial court agreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.093" offset="1969293">The Georgia appellate court took the view, as those courts have taken in the past, that the tort of interference with employment relations is not pre-empted either for supervisors or for employees in that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.741" offset="2059886">The union invoked both this Court's appellate jurisdiction and the certiorari jurisdiction, and the court in setting the case for plenary consideration reserved the question of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.124" offset="2121326">I unfortunately from my own standpoint have to be very brief indeed on the question of appellate jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.558" offset="2159151">We have confessed in our papers that there is no appellate jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.649" offset="2183498">We reviewed this matter after the court's order, and that is our view, and we felt it our obligation to state it straightforwardly.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.346" offset="2242221">We do believe that this case is properly here on certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.283" offset="2270015">It is our substantive position that the Georgia court's rule is squarely contrary to the rule stated by this Court in the Borden and Perko cases in 373 U.S. The argument made by respondents is that we haven't shown a sufficient conflict between Georgia law and this Court's law to warrant certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.032" offset="2417032">We do not understand how we could show a clearer conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.844" offset="2444304">Perko, like this case, is a case in which a supervisor alleged that a union interfered with his employee... employment relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.073" offset="2493205">The only difference between that case and this case is that Mr. Perko didn't even start down the road of exhausting Labor Board procedures, but rather went directly to court.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.110" offset="2581290">Tort claimed in that case and the tort claimed in this case are the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.093" offset="2601248">The union's conduct in both cases is the same, and this Court, as we fully developed in our brief in Perko, held that the tort of interference with employment relations in situations of this kind is pre-emptive.</text>

            <text syncTime="678.300" offset="2854113">Ms. Stillman was going to develop what the exact nature of the Labor Board's regulation, scheme of regulation is in this area, because one prong of our argument is that this is an area where there is a substantial body of Labor Board regulation, and therefore even if one assumes that we look only at the arguably prohibited aspect of Garman, this is, as Perko holds, an area where the particular system of procedures, rules, and remedies stated in the Labor Act pre-empts state law.</text>

            <text syncTime="725.702" offset="3043658">Well, I will ask you, and you tell me if I should ask Mrs. Stillman rather than you.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.234" offset="3069780">Why does this conduct violate the 8(b)(1)(A), making it unfair labor practice for a union to coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in Section 7, when the individual was a supervisor?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="laurence_gold" startTime="749.631" stopTime="801.002">
            <label>Mr. Laurence Gold</label>
            <text syncTime="749.631" offset="3139370">Well, the 8(b)(1) has two parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.861" offset="3164343">The Labor Board takes the view that where, and this is particularly true in the construction industry, you have people who move back and forth between supervisory and employee status, union restraint or coercion of an employer based on the union or non-union status of a supervisor violates the employee's rights, because for the same kind of demonstration effect this Court relied on in cases like American Broadcasting Company versus Writers' Guild.</text>

            <text syncTime="811.796" offset="3388056">Not from that aspect so far as we can tell, because they cited and reaffirmed Taladiga Cotton, which this Court relied on in Perko, and which is part and parcel--</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence Gold</label>
            <text syncTime="877.548" offset="3651057">Well, our view is, and this is the one point I do want to stress before I allow Ms. Stillman her time, that in the area of the extent to which unions can have an impact on supervisors' employment rights, the logic of the entire Act is, as shown by the use of the words 1947 debates on the status of supervisors, is that employers should have very substantial protections in being able to make whatever judgments they want on how they treat supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.134" offset="3889398">As I am sure you are well aware, under the Beasley case, the employer cannot be held under a state right to work law for firing somebody for joining a union or refusing to join a union if that person is a supervisor, as just one example of the great freedom that employers have.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.471" offset="3958779">Given the logic of that situation, we believe that a union certainly can in the interests of its own members ask an employer not to have a certain person as a supervisor and not to have him do certain supervisory tasks, and if that is true, certainly to the extent a union is not engaging in restraint and coercion and is limiting itself to such activity, the area is either arguably protected or designedly left unregulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.097" offset="4109244">And thus, even if it were to be plainly and unequivocally established and taken as established that the union did not violate 8(b)(1), it would not preclude the conclusion that a Georgia determination that the union committed this tort works the greatest possible interference with the federal scheme, namely, a state interdiction of that which Congress allowed to happen, and which in its very extensive... which in Congress's very extensive consideration of how to regulate union-management relations with regard to supervisors, it did not make an unfair labor practice.</text>

            <text syncTime="1152.952" offset="4752693">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, it is the board's position that the trial court judge in this case did exactly the right thing in finding that the complaint, the state action was pre-empted in dismissing the complaint, because, as he said, I am being asked to take a second look at the same matter that the board has looked at here, and in fact has resolved in manners displeasing to the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.600" offset="4843285">We have explained in our brief... We addressed our brief mainly to the complaint allegation, which was, there is malicious interference with contract here because the union coerced and intimidated the company into firing him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.641" offset="4903471">That is what the complaint said, and that seemed to be the theory in the motion to dismiss or affirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.948" offset="4924683">They are now saying, well, we don't have to show coercion and intimidation of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.978" offset="4944745">We can win in the Georgia court if we just show simple interference, just knowingly procured breach of contract, and that they say is not a matter for the board or not a matter with which the board is concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="1336.237" offset="5485793">I would like, Justice Rehnqist, to touch a little more on what you were exploring with Mr. Gold concerning the board's theory of violations of 8(b)(1)(A) in the construction of this... because that is very relevant to this case, and we didn't emphasize this much in our brief because we thought their theory was intimidation and coercion of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.432" offset="5558622">The board has held... now, I am not talking at first with respect to a supervisory position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.038" offset="5585058">I am talking now with respect to, let's say, an employee job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.726" offset="5599791">The board has held that when a union has a hiring hall, when the union has control over jobs out there, and employees have to come through the hiring hall to get jobs, it is, of course, perfectly proper for the union, if it is running its hiring hall properly, non-arbitrarily, to have that kind of control, but if a business agent takes action with respect to somebody's job opportunity on some arbitrary basis... let's say he's very hostile to the man, he says, you have been speaking out in union meetings in a way that I don't like, and you're not going to... I'm going to put you down at the bottom of the list, and you're not going to be treated as fairly as other people... well, the board says this is an 8(b)(1)(A), because this is intimidating that man in his right to be not a docile union member if he doesn't want to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.158" offset="5785470">He has a Section 7 right not to have to toe the line, not to have to curry the favor of the business agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.046" offset="5809084">And so that is an 8(b)(1)(A).</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.124" offset="5817339">Now, what happens... Now, of course, supervisors ordinarily wouldn't have that right, because they don't enjoy rights under Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.058" offset="5845133">They are excluded from the definition of employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.167" offset="5853597">But what happens in the construction industry is, you have workers coming through these hiring halls, and they may on one job get a referral out to a foreman's job, on the next... that job finishes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.319" offset="5902185">Typically these jobs don't last forever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.053" offset="5909081">They may be short-term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.379" offset="5914410">He comes back to the hall for another referral.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.941" offset="5924650">The next time there may be no foreman's job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.723" offset="5931755">He may take a job as an employee, as a worker.</text>

            <text syncTime="1457.780" offset="5971984">Your Honor, we are going on the complaint here, and I don't know what those facts might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.981" offset="6004794">In fact, the deposition, if you want to get into that, although I don't think that is a reviewable record here, said that in the past he had taken employee jobs, and there is no... certainly no... it can't be argued that he wouldn't be dependent on the union in the future for employee jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.581" offset="6079191">What the board says about people in the construction industry is, these men are dependent on the union hiring hall to get jobs, and when the union agent interferes... interferes even by just asking the employer, not necessarily coercing the employer, demonstrates to the workman, I can interfere with your job, he intimidates that workman in his status of, and here I am using a phrase of Judge Roaney's in the Local 725 decision, which enforced the board's order in Local 725 Plumbers, Judge Roaney said, it interferes with the status of that man as a once and future employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.272" offset="6225999">Now, that was arguably... that violation was presented arguably to the regional director when this man came to the regional office, and what the regional director said in his letter was not, I am dismissing the 8(b)(1)(A) charge because I find that you never were an employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.075" offset="6301231">He said the union didn't cause your discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.059" offset="6313143">That is relevant to the finding of an 8(b)(1)(A), and if the union didn't cause the discharge, if the business agent didn't cause the discharge, there can't be any coercion of the man.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.617" offset="6359328">And that's what he said here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.414" offset="6366538">And it seems anomalous to us that this person should be then able, that the appellee should then be able to go to the Georgia court and say, I want you to find a malicious interference with contract because the union did cause my discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.734" offset="6419827">And it is a very tricky area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.796" offset="6432053">If there was not an 8(b)(1)(A) here, if this is in the... then we get into the Teamsters against Morton... Congress focused upon the did not prescribe area, and you are confronted then with the anomaly that the man, if he says the union coerced the employer, he goes to the board and gets an injunctive remedy, and if the union didn't do that, he goes to the state court and gets punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.396" offset="6538423">Now, that doesn't seem a very rational aspect of any scheme Congress could have had in mind.</text>

            <text syncTime="1802.891" offset="7352399">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, I would like to address myself very briefly to the jurisdictional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.995" offset="7380820">The real question is, is this case important enough to warrant a review by this Court on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.584" offset="7403181">It is plaintiff's position that it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.880" offset="7412376">It is our position that the Georgia court of appeals, after carefully reviewing this Court's prior pre-emption holdings, properly decided the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.252" offset="7449888">It held that this case fit within one of the exceptions to the pre-emption doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.124" offset="7477369">In fact, in the exceptions laid down in the Garmon case itself, it held that because he was a supervisor, the plaintiff was a supervisor, it was only of peripheral concern to the Act, and that the issue was deeply seated in local feelings... there is a citizen of Georgia who has been deprived of his right to work... and that there was little likelihood of interference with the federal labor laws because the federal agency had already had a look at it, and it went on to hold that there were different causes of action in the state and federal forums.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.252" offset="7609862">It did not create a new exception to the pre-emption document.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.141" offset="7629401">It found a limited fact situation where a supervisor who has pursued his derivative federal remedy and was unsuccessful could then file a state court lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.852" offset="7676317">It doesn't open the floodgates to a lot of state court actions, and the bottom line is that the Georgia court of appeals properly applied the law and reached the proper decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1927.351" offset="7850293">I would... Now, turning to the merits of the case, it is not the plaintiff's position that this case began with his unfair labor practice charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.442" offset="7882684">It began when the union interfered with his contract of employment as a supervisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.083" offset="7901179">Now, the union defendants and the NLRB, they contend that the Perko case, which is almost identical with this case, controls this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.422" offset="7938587">We agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.592" offset="7943289">We disagree, however, on what Perko stands for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.902" offset="7956454">I think we would all agree that the supervisor must initially take his claim to the federal agency, the NLRB, not because he is protected by the federal Act, because he is not protected by the federal Act, but he must go to the federal agency to avoid any potential conflict between the federal and state laws.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert F. Gore</label>
            <text syncTime="2233.148" offset="9073450">Well, it is the plaintiff's position that the fundamental issue in this case is not whether pre-emption took place, but whether an unfair labor practice proceeding is a supervisor's exclusive forum to seek relief from union interference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.673" offset="9139592">It is the plaintiff's position that if the NLRB finds that the union's actions did not violate the rights of persons protected by the federal law, employees or employers, then the supervisor is free to pursue his private cause of action in state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.291" offset="9210018">This is true for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.257" offset="9217855">The first, Congress, when it removed federal protections from supervisors, did not intend to give the unions license to violate supervisors' rights to employment contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.298" offset="9266025">And secondly, the causes of action in the state and federal forums would be different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.172" offset="9285564">Now, when the Act was amended in 1947, Congress added Section 14(a) in direct response to an NLRB holding that supervisors were employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.400" offset="9338436">14(a) takes supervisors out from under the protections of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.788" offset="9360066">The question, we believe, is, what did Congress intend?</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.333" offset="9374172">Congress intended that employers were to have the... could require complete supervisor loyalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.735" offset="9403847">They were not required to retain a supervisor who had divided loyalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.546" offset="9423073">However, neither the statutory language or the legislative history of Section 14(a) support the proposition that supervisors lost all their common law rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.872" offset="9464347">They lost certain rights vis-a-vis their employer, but they did not lose all their rights against other parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.587" offset="9491200">It is respectfully submitted that Congress did not intend to give unions or any other party a license to interfere with a supervisor's employment contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.660" offset="9531533">Supervisors retain their common law rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.768" offset="9543968">However, to accommodate federal labor law policy, these common law rights are held in abeyance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.284" offset="9569986">Now, the second reason that we believe the unfair labor practice proceedings are not exclusive is because there is different causes of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.621" offset="9611364">Now, both forums deal with the same facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.059" offset="9621081">They both deal with the same union conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.870" offset="9632366">But their focus is entirely different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.120" offset="9641352">There are different elements of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.491" offset="9650861">Now, the federal law protects employees and employers, and the federal inquiry before the board was, did the union conduct restrain or coerce employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.423" offset="9698613">The plaintiff had no evidence that the employees had been coerced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.859" offset="9720347">In fact, there is no evidence in the record that the employees even knew he was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.172" offset="9737587">And the plaintiff had no direct evidence that the union conduct had restrained or coerced his employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.778" offset="9771964">In his statement to the board when specifically asked whether he had any direct evidence, he said he believed the union had coerced the employer, but he did not have any direct evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.711" offset="9811775">The employer, when queried by the board, said, we were not coerced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.632" offset="9831419">Therefore, the federal inquiry, whether employees had been coerced or employers had been coerced, was no longer there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.672" offset="9863602">The NLRB no longer had jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.312" offset="9874155">There was no federal cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.344" offset="9882306">And the regional director properly dismissed the plaintiff's charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.046" offset="9901114">Now, the fact is, the plaintiff was still without a job, but that was irrelevant to the federal inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.621" offset="9935387">Now, the regional director did say the union didn't cause it, but there was no hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.759" offset="9951896">His look at the facts said the union didn't cause your discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.506" offset="9966942">There had been no hearing on it, no discovery, anything that the plaintiff could pursue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.240" offset="9989826">But that was irrelevant to the regional director's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.378" offset="10002364">His decision was that there is no evidence or insufficient evidence to support the theory that the employer was coerced.</text>
