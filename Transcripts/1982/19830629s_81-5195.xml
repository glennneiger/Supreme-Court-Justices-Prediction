            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="7.056" offset="120507">This case is here form the District of Colombia Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.103" offset="136703">In the District, a criminal defendant is acquitted if he can establish an insanity defense by preponderance of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.734" offset="175155">He is then committed to a mental hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.759" offset="187276">In 1975, petitioner Jones was arrested on charges of attempted larceny, a crime punishable by a maximum sentence of one year imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.336" offset="241611">He successfully pleaded insanity and was committed to a mental hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.738" offset="263240">After Jones had been hospitalized for longer than a year, he demanded a civil commitment hearing at which it would be the Government's burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he was mentally ill and dangerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.697" offset="331054">The Court of Appeals rejected that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.647" offset="346832">A judgment of not guilty by a reason of insanity establishes two facts, first, that the defendant committed a criminal act and second, that he did so because of mental illness.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.505" offset="402212">We hold that these findings sufficiently demonstrate mental illness and dangerousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.130" offset="440768">This is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.764" offset="451322">The involuntary commitment is necessary, both for the treatment of the defendant and for protection of society.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.307" offset="485490">Clear and convincing evidence is required to support a civil commitment but where a defendant elects to plead insanity, a judgment on such plead is lawful when supported by a preponderance of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.531" offset="554349">Petitioner argues also that he may not be confined to an institution for a longer period of time than he would have served in prison, but a sentence of incarceration is based on a variety of punitive factors not relevant to a hospital commitment.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.310" offset="633448">Moreover, the statute provides several ways and an insanity acquittee may obtain release including the right to a judicial hearing every six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.653" offset="686842">Jones has not yet been able to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he has recovered from his illness.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.242" offset="721219">We affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.302" offset="733444">Justice Brennan has filed a dissenting opinion joined by Justices Marshall and Blackmun.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.697" offset="759044">Justice Stevens also has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
