            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="92298">The second of the cases is the United States against Rylander which comes from the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.452" offset="122078">This case began when the Internal Revenue Service summoned Rylander to turnover certain records containing two corporations of which Rylander was the president.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.034" offset="160425">Rylander failed to comply with the summons and the Federal District Court issued an enforcement order demanding compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.088" offset="188638">Ultimately, the District Court found Rylander in civil contempt and ordered that he be jailed until he turned over the records.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.071" offset="216536">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.892" offset="227821">The Court agreed with the District Court that the defendant in a contempt proceeding normally has the burden to produce evidence in support of a claim, but the Court of Appeals found that where the defendant like Rylander had asserted both a lack of possession and the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination the burden was moved back to the Government to show that the defendant posses the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.692" offset="319041">In an opinion filed today, we reverse the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.027" offset="332311">A court order enforcing an Internal Revenue Service summons to produce records gives raise to a presumption that a defendant in a contempt proceeding still possesses the records.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.079" offset="372540">To overcome this presumption, the defendant has the burden of coming forth with evidence showing a lack of present possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.660" offset="402842">And the defendant cannot meet this burden by asserting his Fifth Amendment privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.124" offset="420709">While the privilege may prevent the Court from forcing the defendant to answer questions put by the Court or by the government the privilege is not a substitute for relevant evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.023" offset="460311">Justice Marshall has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
