            <label>Mr. Richard David Drake</label>
            <text syncTime="9.939" offset="196703">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.574" offset="211227">The instant case presents two substantial questions concerning our nation's system of federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.462" offset="238813">The initial inquiry focuses upon the deference which the federal judiciary sitting in a habeas corpus action brought by a state inmate must afford the factual determinations made by the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.673" offset="303596">A resolution of this threshold issue centers upon this Court's prior decisions in Sumner v. Mata and Henderson v. Morgan.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.629" offset="339436">The secondary question before this Court concerns the continuing viability of this Court's decision in Spencer v. Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.253" offset="381964">It is respectfully submitted that the court below erred with respect to both issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.073" offset="409235">The facts of this case are essentially uncontroverted.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.977" offset="432850">The respondent was indicted in the Ohio Court of Common Pleas for aggravated murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.131" offset="461480">Under then prevailing law aggravated murder was essentially a felony murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.618" offset="479453">Here, the respondent was indicted for rape during commission of a murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.737" offset="495857">The grand Jury as a separate and distinct matter also returned a death penalty specification, alleging that the respondent had previously been convicted of attempted murder in Cook County, Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.616" offset="559387">Prior to trial the respondent filed a motion to dismiss the death penalty specification, alleging that his 1972 Illinois guilty plea was not intelligently entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.523" offset="611005">Pursuant to this pretrial motion the Ohio trial court conducted a full evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.010" offset="637023">During the course of the hearing several pertinent facts were developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.081" offset="657294">It was developed that the respondent had been incarcerated on at least two prior occasions in the Illnois penal system; that he had been charged with and involved with the Illinois courts unrelated to those prior incarcerations with both rape and murder; that in addition to those crimes he had appeared before the Illinois judiciary on several different occasions by his own admission.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.666" offset="771606">It was further developed that respondent was incarcerated continuously in the Cook County jail for a period of 13 months prior to the entry of this guilty plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.391" offset="822493">Respondent was arrested and given an arraignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.510" offset="835031">He was thereafter afforded a preliminary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.978" offset="848824">By his own testimony the victim in the... of the Illinois incident appeared and testified, offered evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.799" offset="876096">Subsequent to the preliminary hearing the Illinois trial judge bound the case over to the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.571" offset="903263">They returned the indictment, charging the respondent with one count of attempt under Illinois law and three counts of aggravated battery.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.077" offset="945268">Respondent was once again arraigned in the Illinois... before another Illinois court on these charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.783" offset="976093">It was further developed and the Ohio trial court made a finding of fact that the respondent was both intelligent and literate.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.039" offset="1017053">The respondent also conceded that he was represented throughout his 13-month pretrial incarceration by two attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.429" offset="1054669">During the course of the hearing the respondent contended that he was never informed of the attempt charge, neither by service of the indictment, at the preliminary hearing, at either of his two arraignments, by either of his two attorneys, or in any other manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.058" offset="1133141">At the conclusion of the Ohio evidentiary hearing the Ohio trial court expressly found that the Illinois guilty plea had been tendered and was tendered in an intelligent and voluntary manner and that the plea was therefore valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.853" offset="1204403">It is therefore obvious that the Ohio trial court rejected as self serving testimony of the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.541" offset="1235123">And might I also add reference to the record indicates that the Ohio trial court found his testimony wholly incredible.</text>

            <text syncTime="307.130" offset="1385484">The issue before the Ohio court in the evidentiary hearing was in fact crystal clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.201" offset="1401784">The respondent's testimony was uniform; it never deviated.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.086" offset="1417248">He said I never knew I was charged with attempt... in this particular instance, attempted murder.</text>

            <text syncTime="321.624" offset="1443475">It was the sole, single, solitary issue before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.926" offset="1456641">He never alleged he didn't understand, for instance, the elements of attempt, but that he never even knew that he was charged with it and had no idea that he had pled guilty to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.317" offset="1494257">This in the face of a record wherein the trial judge mentions the crime attempt, indicates the separate penalties for attempt, and where his lawyer at the conclusion stipulated that the indict... the charges, plural, in the indictment were sufficient both in law and fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.545" offset="1567087">I don't believe it's ever been argued that the Ohio trial court so horrendously misunderstood the issue before him, and it's never been alleged that he applied the wrong standard, Your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="619.301" offset="2634137">We vigorously argued that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.170" offset="2645630">The Court of Appeals relied on this Court's decision in Burgett v. Texas, extended not only the rationale but the conclusion therein that the substantive offense had to also be vacated.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.228" offset="2697875">That was the summary rationale that the court used.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.981" offset="2716893">They did not dwell on it in any length whatsoever or give any analytical reasoning for the ultimate conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.551" offset="2743119">In order to prove the separate and distinct factual question regarding whether or not the death penalty specification was proven beyond a reasonable doubt, the Ohio prosecutor introduced a certified copy of the Illinois Judgment entry which was proper mode under Ohio law at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.000" offset="2836951">The respondent appealed his conviction to the Ohio Court of Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="684.241" offset="2893898">Under Ohio... the Ohio law is considerably different than the federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.812" offset="2912184">In Hollin v. United States this Court expressly rejected a theory that the prosecution when presenting only circumstantial evidence must disprove all theories consistent with innocence.</text>

            <text syncTime="714.279" offset="3014061">Here the Court of Appeals' rationale was that since the victim knew the respondent, they might have had consensual intercourse prior to the homicide; therefore, it wouldn't be a forcible rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.301" offset="3058156">The Court of Appeals reduced the aggravated murder conviction to what is called simple murder in Ohio.</text>

            <text syncTime="891.811" offset="3724174">In Sumner v.

            <text syncTime="932.222" offset="3885820">The opinion of the court below articulates no reasons whatsoever.</text>

            <text syncTime="942.428" offset="3926675">Paramount in its misinterpretation was the misunderstanding of this Court's decision in Henderson v. Morgan.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.266" offset="3958022">The court had earlier cited a prophylactic rule whereby a guilty plea must be more facially valid than they found this one in their subjective opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.407" offset="4010581">They did not look to the fact that he had competent counsel, the fact that he was arraigned twice, the length of his pretrial incarceration, the fact that he was more than conversant both with the Illinois penal system and most assuredly with the Illinois judiciary, beginning as a young... well, as a Juvenile and essentially working up from there on.</text>

            <label>Mr. John Czarnecki</label>
            <text syncTime="1831.532" offset="7483090">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.417" offset="7494584">I'd like to begin, I guess, by extending Mr. Drake's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.970" offset="7512870">Justice Stevens, you're correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.322" offset="7522274">The stipulation offered by Mr. Lonberger in this case was unqualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.643" offset="7547560">It was designed only to withdraw that issue from the jury, and in fact, it was one of four opportunities we afforded the state at trial to withdraw this particular claim or this particular charge from the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.272" offset="7614016">We filed initially... upon the filing of the Ohio indictment we filed a motion to dismiss, making the claims we make here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.878" offset="7652468">That motion was overruled by the trial court after a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.946" offset="7668768">We then moved the court for a bifurcated procedure, and that in fact... Justice O'Connor asked the question... would have had the effect of keeping this particular issue out of the guilt-innocence phase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.707" offset="7735746">It would have put this issue squarely before the jury only after they had reached a decision on guilt or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.628" offset="7767407">And it was our position then and it remains our position now that the state would suffer no detriment by accepting that proposal, because as a matter of fact had the jury returned a verdict of not guilty, the specification under Ohio law would have become irrelevant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1918.822" offset="7832190">Well, does that really bear on the case here?</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.657" offset="7839609">The state didn't accept a stipulation, and it's got to bear the consequences of whatever resulted from introducing the evidence; but there's no federal rule that requires a state to stipulate it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1930.480" offset="7878897">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.880" offset="7880465">And, in fact, Spencer v. Texas addresses that question precisely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.916" offset="7892586">I was simply addressing Justice Stevens' question on the stipulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.451" offset="7906796">The state in its argument seems to cast great doubt on the Sixth Circuit's opinion herein.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.259" offset="7949950">The Sixth Circuit reviewed the entire record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.811" offset="7964161">It began, as the state court did, with a facially invalid conviction from Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.948" offset="7988716">One ordinarily presents a conviction statement to prove a prior conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.435" offset="8010659">This conviction statement said, among other things, Robert Lonberger has been convicted of the offense of aggravated battery, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.041" offset="8049111">Robert Lonberger has been given one sentence, two to four.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.695" offset="8067710">That conviction statement was concededly ineffective to prove that anyone had been convicted of the offense of attempted murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.301" offset="8106163">The invalidity or the insufficiency of that statement can be shown by the fact that the state was forced to go outside the record, outside the normal channel of proof--</text>

            <text syncTime="2074.609" offset="8455368">I was referring to the conviction statement, the document that ordinarily proves a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.727" offset="8475848">In this case it was insufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.262" offset="8482013">The state then went outside the record with the testimony that was taken at the change of plea and sentencing hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.884" offset="8520465">And notwithstanding what the state's position is, the trial judge in Illinois simply said you are pleading guilty that you did commit the offense of aggravated battery, and you did attempt on the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.961" offset="8580755">Mr. Lonberger's position has been unwavering.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.365" offset="8602385">His position was that he understood he was entering a plea to aggravated battery and that the phrase relating to an attempt provided the factual backdrop for that plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.874" offset="8656406">There is no other factual information in the record to support a plea of aggravated battery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.028" offset="8681066">His position is credible on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.580" offset="8699247">The Sixth Circuit simply found, simply stated, that the Ohio trial court without more could not hold that the state of Ohio had borne its burden to sustain the validity of a conviction that it sought to use on the face of the record presented.</text>

            <text syncTime="2220.336" offset="9038316">Justice O'Connor asked the question during argument, and I had intended to get to it later in my argument, but I will now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.173" offset="9065588">We have no way of knowing, Your Honor, on the strength of the state court finding either what standard he found or he applied or what facts he found.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.962" offset="9104772">In fact, it's entirely possible that the state court found, having made specific findings that this defendant was intelligent... and that's questionable... that he was well represented at every stage of the proceeding by competent and capable counsel, that he was well experienced in the criminal process, and that every effort was taken to protect his constitutional rights, may well have found that those four facts justified a finding, a conclusion of law that the plea was intelligent and voluntary, notwithstanding the fact that the court may have... and we are forced to speculate in the face of a silent record... the court may have found he neither had notice... and that's conceded, I believe... nor actual knowledge from Henderson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.491" offset="9286897">We simply have no way of knowing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.859" offset="9296406">The Sixth Circuit reviewed the record and found, I think properly, that the record presented did not support the trial court's finding that this plea was voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.416" offset="9342590">In the event, Your Honor, on the question of 2254(d) in Sumner versus Mata, this Court held last term in the second remand of Sumner that Sumner in 2254(d) did not apply to mixed findings of fact and law, and I think it's beyond argument that the validity of confessions, the validity of pleas are mixed questions of fact and law, that the federal courts are certainly free to apply federal constitutional standards to historic facts found.</text>
