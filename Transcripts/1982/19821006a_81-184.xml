            <text syncTime="72.849" offset="437319">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="77.201" offset="454768">The issue before the Court here is whether the invocation by the various debtors in these consolidated cases of Section 522(f)(2) of the new Bankruptcy Code violates the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.780" offset="505028">Using as an example the cases of one of these debtors, the relevant facts are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.234" offset="530837">On April 14, 1978, Richard and Sharon Hunter took out a small loan from appellee Beneficial Finance Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.840" offset="565319">The total amount financed was $2,459.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.002" offset="586008">The Hunters executed a printed security agreement in connection with this loan in which by the typing of an X in the appropriate box they pledged as security for the loan, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="122.261" offset="635013">"all household goods, excluding motor vehicles but including household furniture, television sets, electrical appliances, stereo phonographs, furnishings, carpets, draperies, chinaware and other household goods of every kind owned by them and located in or about their residence.

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="141.445" offset="711709">Does it include after-acquired property?</text>

            <text syncTime="149.679" offset="744623">I'm not sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.669" offset="748594">The Hunters estimated the replacement value of these goods... that is, the value that it would... the amount that it would cost them to go out and acquire the goods again... at $2,500, approximately the value of the loan.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.519" offset="803973">They retained possession of all of these goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.770" offset="813064">None of them were turned over to the finance company as a pledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.313" offset="827170">Shortly after the entry of this loan in November 1978 the President signed into law the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 which became effective almost a year later on October the 1st, 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.002" offset="885998">Some time after that October 1979 date when the Act became effective, which is about one... at least one and a half years after the loan was entered into... the Hunters, unable to pay their debts, filed a petition and bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.413" offset="947647">To prevent Beneficial Finance from seizing all of their household goods pursuant to this boilerplate security agreement, the Hunters invoked Section 522(f)(2) of the new Bankruptcy Code to avoid the fixing of a lien on those goods that came within the debtors' exemptions provided by the Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.286" offset="1027059">Now, to briefly explain the operation of Section 522(f)(2), it is a limited provision enacted by Congress that is an integral part of Congress' reform that was specifically directed at the specific problems of consumer debtors.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="235.666" offset="1088603">Much like the Fraser-Lempke Act?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="237.727" stopTime="437.316">
            <label>Mr. Alan I. Horowitz</label>
            <text syncTime="237.727" offset="1096858">Very different from the Fraser-Lempke Act, Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.938" offset="1109710">The Fraser-Lempke Act was a one-time bailout of the farmers there who were unable to continue paying the mortgages on their farms because of the Depression.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.124" offset="1150461">But there was no real amendment of the Bankruptcy Code there.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.757" offset="1164985">In fact, the amendment in the Fraser-Lempke Act was retroactive only.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.021" offset="1182017">It would have had no effect at all on future mortgages that were entered into.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.853" offset="1201348">The law remained the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.616" offset="1208453">Here there was a wholesale change essentially in the Bankruptcy Code, and this was a provision set up for the way the new Bankruptcy Code would operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.561" offset="1256205">The issue in this case is sort of the incidental effect of that change in the Code as it applies to security interests that were entered into before the act was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.767" offset="1292985">In order to guarantee bankrupt debtors a fresh start, which this Court has repeatedly recognized as one of the key reasons for bankruptcy, Congress established a set of federal exemptions with specific dollar limitations on certain goods that if deemed to be necessary for the debtors to continue after bankruptcy... items such as household goods, tools of the debtor's trade, and the home.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.167" offset="1406566">Congress found, however, that similar exemptions in the past provided under state law had proven ineffective in guaranteeing the debtors this fresh start because, as in this case, consumer finance companies had obtained blanket liens in all the debtor's household goods, thus enabling these creditors to levy on the exempt property or to use the threat of repossession of the exempt property to compel the debtor to reaffirm the debt after bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.137" offset="1522445">To safeguard these exemptions and make them effective, Congress enacted Section 522(f)(2) which enables the debtor in the bankruptcy proceeding to avoid the fixing of the liens on certain of the exempt property.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.425" offset="1579601">This avoidance provision is fairly limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.747" offset="1592976">It applies only to certain kinds of liens... nonpossessory, nonpurchase money, security interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.353" offset="1619412">It applies to only certain categories of the exemptions that were provided by Congress; for example, liens on motor vehicles or liens on a home are not included within the avoidance provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.820" offset="1665178">And finally it is limited by the dollar limitations on the value of the exempt property.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.012" offset="1685972">Valuable property cannot be subject to avoidance under these provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.065" offset="1706243">This is the provision that the Hunters invoked enabling them to emerge from bankruptcy in unencumbered possession of their furniture, silverware and other household goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.162" offset="1746576">And the appellees challenged the Hunter's invocation of this section as violative of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.866" offset="1769459">Now, despite the fact that the Court of Appeals found... did not challenge the Congress... the need for this legislation and the fact that it was important to achieve the congressional purposes, the court found that the application to the security interest involved in this case in fact violated the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.140" offset="1850543">The Court of Appeals relied exclusively on this Court's decision in Louisville Joint Stock Land Bank v. Radford, decided in 1935, and it felt itself bound by that decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="437.316" offset="1895265">Mr. Horowitz, I suppose the problem of the Fifth Amendment question could have been avoided if it had been determined that the provision was not intended to be retroactive, right?</text>

            <label>Mr. Alan I. Horowitz</label>
            <text syncTime="458.861" offset="1981364">--Well, there's nothing at all in the legislative history in the statute that suggests that the section wouldn't be retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.405" offset="2011562">The act as a whole seems to apply retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.546" offset="2024101">There's a savings clause that makes clear that bankruptcy proceedings that were begun before the effective date of the act are to be decided under the old act; that all bankruptcy proceedings commenced after October 1979 are to be heard under the provisions of the new act.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.469" offset="2095781">There's no special exception for any provisions of the act, and it wouldn't make any sense for Congress... it would just leave a gap essentially in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.325" offset="2131203">There would be no law to apply if the new law didn't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.227" offset="2142905">Now, the Court of Appeals rejected this, this contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.070" offset="2158265">They also found there was no evidence for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.910" offset="2165580">The appellees have briefly argued that the statute should be read to be not retroactive; but they're also unable to find anything directive of Section 522(f).</text>
            <text syncTime="516.279" offset="2211033">Essentially their position is that the entire Bankruptcy Code should not be applied to any security interests or any other claims that arose before the enactment date of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.186" offset="2262651">And that would just leave chaos essentially.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.617" offset="2272368">It would postpone the effective date of the act for many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.190" offset="2286683">And there's just simply no evidence of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.432" offset="2295670">So I think we're pretty much stuck with the fact that Congress made the statute retroactive, and we'll have to address the constitutional question.</text>

            <label>Mr. Alan I. Horowitz</label>
            <text syncTime="577.949" offset="2457733">Any household good is exempt up to a value of $200 on that item.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.172" offset="2478631">The idea of the exemptions is that these items aren't really... used silverware, used chairs, things like that don't have much of a resale value; they're not worth very much to other parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.698" offset="2520741">They are worth something to the debtor who has to go out and replace them.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.481" offset="2535892">I think $200 was meant to make sure that real luxury items that were worth a lot of money didn't come in under this exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.976" offset="2569851">So if you have, for example, an expensive stereo, that would be worth more than $200, and that wouldn't be exempt; but most items probably will fall under that.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.131" offset="2602452">And the idea is for the debtor to be able to retain essentially his living room furniture and his bedroom furniture, things like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.266" offset="2627007">If the $200 is an aggregate, probably everything... most people own a total of things that are worth more than $200.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.992" offset="2657936">The reasoning of the Court of Appeals is that these blanket security interests in household goods must be characterized as property under the Fifth Amendment, and hence, avoidance of these security interests under Section 522(f) necessarily must be a taking without just compensation in violation of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.006" offset="2749991">But this superficial analysis utterly fails to address the peculiar nature of the property interest that is involved here, and it is only on that property interest that Congress narrowly and exclusively focused its attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.705" offset="2804744">Unlike the traditional type of property interest, and certainly unlike the real estate mortgage that was involved in Radford, the creditor here has no interest in actual physical possession of the subject property or in applying that property to satisfy the debt, even if the debtor defaults.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.436" offset="2875692">Congress found that the used household goods secured by these blanket liens are generally of negligible resale value such that it does not pay for the creditor to physically repossess them.</text>

            <text syncTime="759.486" offset="3183937">Rather, the value of the liens to the creditor is when the property remains in the possession of the debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.090" offset="3206298">It is the threat of repossession of the goods which gives the debtor a powerful incentive to agree to various demands of the creditor... for example, to reaffirm the debt... that provides the creditor's interest in the lien, because the replacement value of these goods to the debtor is so high that he cannot afford to have them repossessed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1464.649" offset="6004535">We have two grounds that we are presenting today upon which we believe the judgment below should be affirmed, and I'd like to discuss them in turn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.264" offset="6046958">The first ground is that the 1978 Bankruptcy Act may not be applied in this situation because of its unconstitutionality, because of the integral nature of the judiciary provisions which have been held unconstitutional already.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.767" offset="6128982">I will address that after we first respond to the Government with respect to the retroactive application of 522(f).</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.484" offset="6159911">As this Court noted in the questionings of the Government, the real vice here is not whether Congress can decide for the future that the policy of the federal government in bankruptcy will be that certain kinds of interests are or are not protectable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.518" offset="6252071">The question is whether Congress or committees of Congress or testimony before Congress can be used to decide whether the transaction in existence at that time between A and B is in fact void because unconscionable, because a subject of overreaching, because the interest was only used for threat purposes, et cetera... whatever the justifications are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.498" offset="6371921">The real vice in this statute is that it usurps the judicial function of deciding cases between existing parties and decides as a matter of legislative policy, at least as interpreted by the Solicitor General, that A's contract with B was unconscionable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.015" offset="6477978">Now, in the record of this case before this Court there's not a trace of suggestion that these transactions are in fact unconscionable, the subject of overreaching, the property is held by these creditors only for threat purposes, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.337" offset="6543284">I think each of these justifications would be, as we pointed out, true... at least the threat justification... true with respect to all creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.965" offset="6589782">As Justice O'Connor has pointed out, there is no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.245" offset="6602948">And the principle upon which the Government is urging this Court to destroy or permit the destruction retroactively of vested property rights admits of no real distinction between myself here--</text>

            <text syncTime="3021.715" offset="12232858">I'd like to take issue with Mr. Field's statement that this Court cannot distinguish between different kinds of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.388" offset="12255532">Clearly this Court can and must distinguish between property interest like the fee simple and real property or mortgage and real property, and the kind of security interest that's involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.804" offset="12297119">All of the takings cases that this Court has decided involve making judgments by this Court as to the character of the government action, the economic expectations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.351" offset="12335363">They don't admit of a bright line rule, and certainly an important feature that the Court must consider in these cases is the nature of the property interest that hasn't been prominent in some of the Court's recent decisions because they were always dealing in these cases with a traditional real property interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.601" offset="12404326">Here we have this fairly negligible property interest that is almost indistinguishable from the right to collect on the debt, and the Court has to take that into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.598" offset="12436300">As far as whether the lien has been totally destroyed here, as the Tenth Circuit said, we have discussed in our brief the fact that it really isn't, and Justice Stevens has alluded to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.845" offset="12481335">I would just urge the Court to compare the destruction that you have here with the destruction in Anders against Allers, the Eagle feathers case, and I think that you will agree there is no more of a total destruction here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.133" offset="12526474">But even assuming that there is, I think it's very instructive to look at the Armstrong case, which Justice O'Connor alluded to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.856" offset="12557403">If you look at the Court's analysis in that case, the Court quickly decided that the lien involved there in fact was a compensable property interest and that the lien there was totally destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.775" offset="12601080">The Court then went on for several pages to decide whether in fact that was a taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.619" offset="12624381">Clearly, the fact that the property interest was destroyed was not sufficient to show as a taking, and there they found the taking only because the nature of the government action was a taking of the property for the government's own benefit in its entrepreneurial capacity and indeed three Justices dissented on that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.612" offset="12696375">So I think here you also have to look at the taking analysis set out in Penn Central, and because this is an ordinary government regulation like the minimum wage legislation and because it does not interfere with the substantial expectation of the creditor.</text>

            <text syncTime="3197.779" offset="12937015">But I think the Court has to take into account the fact that the property interest is weak and that it's very hard to separate the property interest here from the debtor's personal obligation, and the fact is that the whole idea of bankruptcy is to discharge the debtor's personal obligation.</text>
