            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="129456">We will hear arguments first this morning in City of Port Arthur against United States and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.264" offset="162475">Mr. Keith.</text>

          <turn speaker="robert_q_keith" startTime="10.233" stopTime="493.351">
            <label>Mr. Robert Q. Keith</label>
            <text syncTime="10.233" offset="170312">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.465" offset="199255">The expanded city of Port Arthur, Texas, constitutes a black population that amounts to 35 percent of the voting age population.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.740" offset="260382">This expansion occurred through a popular election and consolidation with two adjoining suburban cities and the subsequent annexation of an unincorporated area to the east of Port Arthur.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.733" offset="332375">Because of the expansion, the black population in the city by 1980 census standards changed from a 45 percent black total population to a 40 percent black total population.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.178" offset="410116">The case was tried to the three-judge district court in the District of Columbia on an election plan that is not before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.860" offset="456823">It was tried on what we know in this record as a 4-4-1 election plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.499" offset="487438">The city was divided into four single-member districts of equal size and a representative was to be elected from each of those districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.697" offset="532160">Then there was an at-large representative to be elected from each of those four districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.397" offset="566955">So there were four single-member representatives and four at-large representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.378" offset="586912">We tried the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.893" offset="592973">The court approved the expansion of the boundaries as being objectively verifiable, legitimate in purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.234" offset="630380">We lost the case on the question of the 4-4-1 plan, there's no question about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.824" offset="660682">When the district court opinion was rendered, the court directed the city to detail the steps that it would take to address the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.069" offset="717629">The city went to the United States, to the Attorney General, and hammered out an agreed election plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.299" offset="758589">The parties then through joint submission submitted that agreed election plan to the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.091" offset="797773">It is that agreed election plan that is before Your Honors today.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.620" offset="819925">In this record we call that plan the 4-2-3 plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.884" offset="844898">There are four single-member districts of equal size.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.944" offset="877185">There are then... on the left side of town, the two single-member districts are combined, and on the east side of town the two single-member districts are combined into two additional single-member districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.483" offset="939356">Thus we have six single-member districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.060" offset="953672">That's four plus two.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.589" offset="975719">Then there are three at-large representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.510" offset="995467">One is the mayor, who may reside anywhere in the community and be elected at large, and that is not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.959" offset="1033188">There are two at-large representatives, one of whom must reside on the east and one of whom must reside on the west.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.298" offset="1082612">In the joint submission made by the Attorney General following a protracted trial, the parties stated that the agreed plan provides the minority population with representation reasonably equivalent to its strength in the expanded city, tracking verbatim Richmond.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.005" offset="1201417">The Attorney General and the city agreed to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.253" offset="1218449">Turning to Section 5 of the Act, there's no question the purpose was legitimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.344" offset="1246765">We were responding to a directive of the court, and we worked with the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.483" offset="1267350">There is no question that the effect of the change was legitimate, because, as the Attorney General stated in the agreed submission, the single-member districts in the city's plan would appear to provide the minority community with a fair opportunity to obtain representation reasonably equivalent to their political strength in the enlarged community, and cited Richmond.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.033" offset="1393574">The demographics of the single-member districts are such that one district has, in round terms, an 81 percent black population, a second district has a 61 percent black population.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.662" offset="1496078">Then those two are combined into a third single-member district that has a 71 percent black population.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.362" offset="1534844">These facts are agreed and undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.892" offset="1548950">There are three single-member districts that have a majority black population.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.312" offset="1574654">There are three single-member districts that have a largely white population.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.606" offset="1595866">But we went one step further in this case that is a little unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.431" offset="1619167">The Attorney General and the parties, the city, agreed that in all probability representation would be provided equivalent to the strength of the minority community.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.692" offset="1660127">The court, the district court and a court in Texas, permitted the holding of elections subsequent to disapproving this 4-2-3 plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.469" offset="1715298">We conducted elections in the six single-member districts and in the mayor's race.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.669" offset="1748107">That's before Your Honors in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.933" offset="1765139">In those elections which were conducted in those six single-member districts there were three black citizens elected from the majority black districts and there were three white citizens elected from the majority white districts, thus, if you will, proving categorically and undisputedly that the minority community received representation reasonably equivalent to its political strength in the expanded community.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.247" offset="1902439">The United States has argued very vigorously the facts of the case as if the original plan that we tried was before Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.100" offset="1961789">The district court disapproved the 4-2-3 plan notwithstanding the representation and agreement of the Attorney General and the City of Port Arthur.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.359" offset="2018840">The district court decision was two to one.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.577" offset="2031693">The majority, in rejecting the plan, stated that it did not sufficiently neutralize the effects of expansion and dilution.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.056" offset="2085609">That was the conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.835" offset="2096790">There were no reasons given.</text>

            <text syncTime="599.199" offset="2526243">Not at all, because if you take Justice Marshall's footnote in the Beer case and do the mathematics... and these become mathematical cases... our representation of 33 percent minority representation on the council and a 40 percent population, if you take that ratio, that's identical to that which he suggested was appropriate in the New Orleans... in the Beer case in New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.436" offset="2643167">So we're entirely comfortable with the 40 percent population, or we're entirely comfortable, of course, with the 35 percent voting age population.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.573" offset="2687680">Either way, the position of the court is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.337" offset="2698756">Now, Your Honors, in addition to the three majority black seats, there is a representative elected at-large from a district consisting of 71 percent black citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.455" offset="2759255">And as Justice Blackmun said in concurrence in Mobile, the residency provides additional cross-sectional view, or the residency requirement provides additional cross-sectional view.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.091" offset="2809724">Furthermore, in addition to having these three safe seats, if you will, the majority community also has a full opportunity to participate in the election of the two at-large representatives and the mayor.</text>

            <text syncTime="1416.123" offset="5793848">The issue in this case involving Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act is whether the district court erred in refusing to preclear the City of Port Arthur's post-annexation electoral plan so long as the city insisted on including a majority vote requirement for the election at large of two members of the city council.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.789" offset="5860512">In the view of the Government, the issue is an exceedingly narrow one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.179" offset="5874096">There is no dispute that the annexations of Lakeview, Pear Ridge, and Sabine Pass are subject to the requirements of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.517" offset="5915474">There is no dispute that the effect of those annexations is to significantly dilute the minority voting strength in the City of Port Arthur, in the expanded City of Port Arthur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.623" offset="5955912">Indeed, there is some reason to suspect, from the findings of the district court with regard to the 4-4-1 plan, that the motivation, at least in part, for the expansion of the City of Port Arthur was to assure that the white majority retained its status as the majority for the foreseeable future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.398" offset="6026965">Thus we are all in agreement that the basic test to be satisfied is that announced by the Court in the City of Richmond decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1483.565" offset="6063640">Well, largely because the Beer case deals with a situation where there's simply a change in an electoral practice dealing with a pre-existing city and that city remains as it is, whereas--</text>

            <text syncTime="1543.118" offset="6301877">In our view, that simply does not square with the language of the test.</text>

            <text syncTime="1553.052" offset="6341583">But its terms, it is not a bright-line test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.379" offset="6350883">It requires the exercise of judgment by the tryer of fact and by the court in deciding whether or not a particular plan satisfies the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.125" offset="6385887">Indeed, given the variable types of plans that are available and subject to review under City of Richmond, it is inconceivable that there can be any kind of a bright-line test.</text>

            <text syncTime="1687.810" offset="6880646">Well, because it is based on a set of findings that we believe are not clearly erroneous, and once you accept those findings, viewed through the prism of the district court's July 14th order, it seems to me there is no other conclusion that's available at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.758" offset="6940414">Specifically, there are four facts that we regard, that the district court found, that we think control this case:</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.583" offset="6967686">First, the City of Port Arthur faces severe racial block voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.847" offset="6984823">The statistic that's used in this case is one that demonstrates statistically significant polarization at the.5 or.6 level,.5 or.6.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.405" offset="7023066">Elections just prior to the annexation in this case involved racial polarization at.8 and above.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.636" offset="7051905">Accordingly, it is clear that this is a badly divided city on the basis of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.197" offset="7070191">An even more important finding in our view is the district court's conclusions that with at-large seats and a majority vote election the black community has no opportunity to influence any elections at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.941" offset="7125152">That is, even white versus white candidates, the black community is unable... has no more than a mere theoretical possibility of exercising a swing vote influence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.406" offset="7171023">Accordingly, the ultimate effect of this plan as viewed from the district court's perspective must be to discard the black community or eliminate the black community's influence over six of the nine seats of the city council.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.602" offset="7231836">Third, the district court found that in the past when there is a majority white population controlling the politics in the City of Port Arthur, there is a pervasive and systematic disregard for the black community, a systematic disregard that we submit, the court would conclude, will continue into the future unless this plan is modified.</text>

            <text syncTime="1901.945" offset="7737149">Well, the purpose of the Voting Rights Act and the approval of these changes is to determine their future effect, and I would think it would raise serious question if you completely disregarded what might be the potential effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.066" offset="7781662">Assuming the voting age population is just significantly different from the overall population, it might create a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.093" offset="7805799">In a case like this, where the difference is not that significant, it would be hard to imagine that it would be very difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.576" offset="7827742">The fourth finding that we think is significant from the district court's June 12th opinion is its conclusion that residency districts do not offer the black community any greater influence over no residency districts, because of the pockets of white influence in the black districts and accordingly the availability of white candidates, who in at-large elections will continue to maintain the domination of the white community in Port Arthur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.473" offset="7923245">Based on these findings, we believe that the district court could conclude, legitimately conclude in the exercise of its equitable judgment, that this plan does not satisfy the Voting Rights Act, and that a single minor modification would be required, should be required in order to assure that blacks will have influence in the future in these elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.245" offset="8010390">That modification is the elimination of the majority vote requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.916" offset="8025018">That elimination in no way offers the black community the opportunity to control additional seats.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.929" offset="8053126">It merely grants them the right to have influence over the elected officials from those districts in the at-large elections, and that we think is an appropriate exercise.</text>

            <text syncTime="2299.424" offset="9327066">Now, they did cast some doubt on it, but they clearly came out on page 1 with an unequivocal finding of no discriminatory purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="2339.644" offset="9487980">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.910" offset="9492996">The Solicitor General states that the residence requirement offers nothing to the black citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.828" offset="9524760">As the record shows, the residency requirement was imposed as a condition of settlement by the Attorney General, and it seems strange that they would now say it offers nothing to the black community when the joint submission makes very plain that it was at their insistence and did advance the interest of the black community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.960" offset="9609293">Justice Rehnquist asked about Beer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.256" offset="9622458">Your Honor, before these annexations began there was one black representative among seven on the council.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.174" offset="9654119">Even just voting on a partial council, there are now three black representatives out of nine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.875" offset="9688914">So if Beer becomes the test, we have met Beer at least twice over.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.873" offset="9712947">Regardless of the effect of the swing vote, the black community still has three representatives in a nine-person council.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.444" offset="9763206">It has 35 percent of the voting age population.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.271" offset="9774491">The Richmond standard is clear and direct and does not invoke a lot of confusion, doubt, and subjective judgments, that apparently would flow from an affirmance of this district court decision.</text>
