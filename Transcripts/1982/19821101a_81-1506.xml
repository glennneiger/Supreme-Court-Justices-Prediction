            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="153780">We will hear arguments next in Federal Election Commission against the National Right to Work Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.856" offset="189202">Mr. Steele, I think you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_n_steele" startTime="62.573" stopTime="656.540">
            <label>Mr. Charles N. Steele</label>
            <text syncTime="62.573" offset="404033">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="72.012" offset="441754">This case involves the scope and effect of the provisions of the statute which regulates the participation of corporations and labor organizations in the financing of federal election campaigns.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.070" offset="490028">The case was brought by the Federal Election Commission against the National Right to Work Corporation saying that it had violated the prohibitions on the use of general corporate treasury funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.509" offset="535795">The facts are largely uncontested.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.428" offset="547393">They were found by the district court below; none of them were reversed as erroneous by the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.416" offset="575396">The district court found that the... under Virginia law, corporations are offered a choice as to whether they wish to become membership corporations or non-membership corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.457" offset="627537">Virginia law specifically provides that the articles of incorporation must set forth that fact, whether you are a member... if you are a non-membership organization it sets that forth, and if you are a membership organization that you're not.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.849" offset="673094">The National Right to Work Committee organized itself under these laws, set itself forth in its charter and in its bylaws and in its formal papers as being an organization that had no members.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.657" offset="720324">It's not a membership organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.040" offset="725862">The corporation was also organized under 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code as an educational organization involved in combatting what it refers to compulsory unionism.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.130" offset="778211">The district court also found that with regard to this organization that its basic method of receiving funds was to rent mailing lists, obtain mailing lists.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.676" offset="848428">From these mailing lists they would send out large mailings.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.044" offset="857937">These mailings included several items.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.913" offset="873401">The first item would be an article about compulsory unionism and the viewpoints on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.084" offset="894090">Included therein was... again, the record is full of examples of these, and in summarizing them, there are some differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.855" offset="925124">But the basic format was that there would be an article on the effects of unionism, compulsory unionism, frequently reprinted from a magazine.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.195" offset="962531">With it would be a questionnaire asking questions of the people to whom these mailings went as to whether they agreed with various questions about the effect of these laws, various right to work laws, of various labor laws that were pending in front of the Congress, and there would be a request or a donation, or sometimes called a gift or a contribution to support the mailing out of these materials, to support in the fight against these particular bills, and would seek funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.512" offset="1071827">Also, frequently there would be a request to engage in what is called legislative action in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.582" offset="1092098">Legislative action is taken as a term defined therein to send in comments to legislators, and there would often be appeals for that kind of mailings to legislators.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.788" offset="1128879">There was no... as the district court found, there was no reference in any of these materials to membership in the organization, no setting forth of any requirements for membership, no invitation to join in membership; solely, the request for funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.115" offset="1186139">There were also several other factors that the district court looked at.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.970" offset="1225636">It looked at the fact that there was nothing set forth as to how these people would terminate their so-called membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.861" offset="1265133">In this case, the court set forth the determination was something that was solely determined by the National Right to Work Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.801" offset="1308915">The court of appeals disturbed none of these findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.621" offset="1324170">In fact, the court of appeals' interpretation and what the Commission believes to be a very important statutory issue was based on the findings, but went to the scope and effect of the basic prohibitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.380" offset="1383207">And that scope and effect involve the question of statutory interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.182" offset="1402433">It's clear that the court of appeals, in its interpretation, felt that interpretation was illuminated certainly by constitutional considerations, which it certainly is, but basically was a question of the scope of the statutory history.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.342" offset="1459067">To review that statutory history, I would note first that under the Federal Election Campaign Act there are two forms, two basic provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.900" offset="1501280">One, Provision 441b, which was the former U.S. 610, governs corporations and labor organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.089" offset="1546107">There are other general provisions first enacted in 1971 governing political committees as a whole and their operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.444" offset="1583514">And as we have noted in our brief, we think that this structure was reviewed by this Court in the California Medical Association case two terms ago, and that basically, what was set forth there is that Congress, in attempting to legislate for the purpose of controlling the effect on the electoral process, is entitled to make certain kinds of judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.595" offset="1684138">The basic judgment that Congress made long, long ago was that corporations... and then in 1947 labor organizations... presented a different case; a special case, a greater danger to the electoral process.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.319" offset="1735024">Consequently, the initial actions of the Congress in 1907 were to ban totally contributions by corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.758" offset="1768774">Through a process which I know this Court is familiar with and which, as a matter of history, would take me a long time to recite, there was an expansion of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.031" offset="1805868">In 1947 Congress, feeling that the definition of contributions had allowed certain expenditures to be made which were, for all practical purposes, the same as contributions, broadened the definition to include expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.576" offset="1868040">But basically, corporations and labor organizations were regulated by a statute which prohibited them generally from making expenditures that would reach outside of them, to affect the general public, to affect the general electorals, but were... under the decisions of this Court and of the Congress in amending the statute... were permitted to make expenditures for communications to their members.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.941" offset="1969499">And most prominently, first by interpretation of this Court and then effectively enacted in 1971 by the Congress, were allowed to establish, maintain and pay for the solicitations to a separate segregated fund, and those solicitations were limited to its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.735" offset="2040657">In effect, what the statute controls is the use of the corporation's funds or the labor organization's funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.306" offset="2066988">Finally, in 1976, in relation to this case, there was an amendment known as the Allen Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.578" offset="2104082">When the Congress convened to act on the statute after this Court's decision in Buckley versus Valeo, it inserted several provisions with regard to then 610.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.838" offset="2153088">As this Court probably knows, it moved it from the criminal sections of 18 USC to the Title II and turned it to a civil statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.528" offset="2191853">But with regard to this case, they enacted a provision which said that for a membership corporation, the statute if read to bar it from soliciting its members would prohibit it from dealing with those people who basically make up the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.072" offset="2257996">Consequently, Senator Allen proposed and Senator Cannon, who was managing the bill on behalf of the proponents of the bill, agreed that amendment really corrected a basic deficiency in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.832" offset="2317032">I don't know if deficiency is too strong a word, but basically, without that amendment, it was a clarifying amendment to make it clear that for those people who were the members of the corporation, that they would be allowed to do the same solicitation as they would to shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.056" offset="2373979">As we have set forth in our brief, we think that the legislative history of that shows that the purpose of Congress there was to deal with members for a membership corporation in much the same way that it had dealt with shareholders for a stock corporation or for members in unions, as the specialized case of membership organizations that the Congress has legislated specially for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.838" offset="2465094">Senator Allen, who was the proponent, spoke of it in those terms; spoke of it as supplying a deficiency, as remedying an omission in the bill that would otherwise not make it clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.646" offset="2512324">The question, then, on which the court of appeals disagreed with the district court and the Commission, was the interpretation of that term, of the membership organization which is incorporated.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.287" offset="2562897">It said that the scope and effect of that must be to allow a corporation to solicit anyone who has expressed through various means a political affinity with the goals of the organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.130" offset="2622247">The court of appeals' opinion rested on the feeling that there would be interference with associational rights if such solicitations were not allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.521" offset="2659863">As we have indicated in our brief, we consider that the focus of the statute is not on the solicitation but is on the flow of corporation money.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.460" offset="2695599">The National Right to Work Committee here, having established a separate, segregated fund, is permitted under the statute to pay for all of the costs involved in that fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.649" offset="2732275">Those involve all of the costs of establishing and maintaining, setting it up, incorporating if it is incorporated.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.088" offset="2766129">If it's not, the articles for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.938" offset="2773444">All of those matters.</text>

            <text syncTime="727.836" offset="3065075">But I don't want to get to the example.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.672" offset="3072389">You say that in seeking to solicit money from these people that are circularizing, they are, what, accepting a contribution for an election?</text>

            <text syncTime="747.198" offset="3142502">In other words, that the prohibition is against using that money, that corporate treasury money, to make an expenditure to go forth and seek contributions which would come directly to the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.338" offset="3195060">It can set up a political fund which can do that, but--</text>

            <text syncTime="794.179" offset="3330479">So that the critical question in the court of appeals' decision was what is the definition of members as intended by Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="807.169" offset="3382410">They felt that there was no valid purpose there.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.688" offset="3392441">Again, the underlying purpose served by that is the use of the corporation's funds for large-scale use in federal elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.877" offset="3425251">The structure has been designed in that fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.579" offset="3436013">I would note, as I started to, that there is a separate regulatory scheme for political committees overall, which this Court considered in the California Medical Association case, which limits anyone else to a contribution stated in dollar terms of $5000 to a political action committee.</text>

            <text syncTime="863.572" offset="3608004">As I say, that operative language was clearly interpreted throughout the history of the statute as prohibiting the expenditures out to the general public.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.130" offset="3650218">In the CIO case, this Court was faced with the question of whether that statute could be read or should be read to prohibit expenditures that were made for the purpose of communicating with, in that case, the members of a labor organization, but by parallel, with the stockholders of a stock corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.425" offset="3719390">So that phrase, by that interpretation and by this Court's interpretation also in Pipefitters, is clearly meant not to allow a corporation to make those kind of expenditures out to the general public; to solicit broadly for purposes either to get in funds to give to candidates, or to make expenditures that would tout them on radio or whatever.</text>
