            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="122142">We'll hear arguments next in Tuten against the United States.</text>

            <label>Ms. Linda Gillespie Stuntz</label>
            <text syncTime="125.354" offset="623484">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.883" offset="645636">This is a criminal case involving the application to the particular facts of this case of Section 5021(b) of the Federal Youth Corrections Act of 1950 and Section 3204 Chapter 22 of the District of Columbia Code, in particular a provision of that section multiplying by a factor of ten the penalty for repeat offenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.402" offset="755664">These provisions are set forth at pages 2 and 3 of petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.902" offset="773740">The question before the Court is: Whether petitioner may be sentenced as a recidivist under Section 3204 based on a conviction for which he served a sentence of 2 years of probation pursuant to Section 5010(a) of the Federal Youth Corrections Act and was granted an unconditional discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.501" offset="868095">The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals which answered a similar question in the negative is in conflict with the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, the court below, which answered this question in the affirmative.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.181" offset="922847">Petitioner maintains that the District of Columbia Court of Appeals is in error and that his sentencing as a recidivist was improper for two independent reasons: Number one, his earlier Federal Youth Corrections Act conviction was set aside pursuant to Section 5021(b) when he received his unconditional discharge; and number two, whether or not it was technically set aside pursuant to Section 5021, it is not a proper basis upon which to impose a recidivist penalty under Section 3204.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.557" offset="1084284">The facts are not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.398" offset="1099644">On February 12, 1971, petitioner, then 19 years of age, entered a plea of guilty in the District of Columbia Court of General Sessions to the charge of carrying a pistol without a license, in violation of 22 D.C. Code Section 3204.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.378" offset="1175608">The imposition of sentence was suspended, and petitioner was placed on probation under Section 5010(a) of the Federal Youth Corrections Act for a period of 2 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.575" offset="1224405">Contrary to established Probation Department procedures, petitioner's term of probation was allowed to expire without judicial attention to the question of whether or not he should have been discharged prior to the end of his two-year term.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.878" offset="1289606">At the end of his term in 1973 petitioner was granted an unconditional discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.221" offset="1318968">However, no certificate was issued setting aside his conviction pursuant to Section 5021(b) of the Youth Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.780" offset="1353241">On June 19, 1980, a two-count indictment was filed charging petitioner with assault with a dangerous weapon, a stick, and carrying a pistol without a license, after having been previously convicted of carrying an unlicensed pistol.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.008" offset="1422100">Both offenses were allegedly committed on November 23, 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.363" offset="1443520">Prior to petitioner's trial, the government informed the Court below, pursuant to D.C. law, that petitioner had previously been convicted of carrying a pistol without a license and was therefore subject to the increased recidivist penalty provided by Section 3204.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.950" offset="1521887">The previous conviction relied upon by the government was the same 1970 offense for which petitioner had been sentenced under the Federal Youth Corrections Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.835" offset="1569430">On November 27, 1980, a jury found petitioner not guilty of assault with a stick but guilty of carrying a pistol without a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.146" offset="1610704">On January 26, 1981, petitioner was sentenced to a felony term of not less than two nor more than six years.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.531" offset="1652186">Had he been sentenced as a first-time offender pursuant to Section 3215 of the D.C. Code, the maximum sentence that he could have been given is one year imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.308" offset="1695340">Petitioner appealed his sentence as contrary to Section 5021(b) of the Youth Act and of the construction placed on that section by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in United States versus Arrington.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.819" offset="1753332">However, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.581" offset="1768379">It found Arrington to be based on unpersuasive authority and held that under Section 5021(b) only those youth offenders who are unconditionally discharged by a court prior to completing a Youth Act probationary sentence are entitled to have their convictions set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.307" offset="1851344">The Court concluded that a conviction which was not set aside was a proper basis for the recidivist sentence that petitioner received.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.415" offset="1883735">On October 12, 1982, this Court granted a petition for writ of certiorari to review the decision of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.142" offset="1926681">The gist of petitioner's argument is that the use of his 1971 Federal Youth Act conviction to trigger the felony recidivist penalty contained in Section 3204 of the District of Columbia Code was improper on two independent grounds: first, the 1971 conviction had been automatically set aside pursuant to Section 5021(b) by petitioner's unconditional discharge from probation; and second, whether or not it was technically set aside, it may not properly be used to trigger a recidivist penalty.</text>

            <label>Ms. Linda Gillespie Stuntz</label>
            <text syncTime="666.790" offset="2789244">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.490" offset="2796036">I will proceed to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.897" offset="2801678">The government contends that the language of Section 5021(b) is entirely clear and compels the conclusion that a Youth Act conviction will be set aside only when the youth has been discharged prior to the expiration of his probationary sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.825" offset="2881404">Petitioner was not discharged prior to the end of his 2-year probationary term.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.729" offset="2901048">Therefore, the government reasons in the Court below, that this conviction was not set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.492" offset="2924036">However, Section 5021(b) does not provide for the set-aside of the conviction of a youth offender who is discharged before the expiration of his sentence or whatever sentence it is that's imposed upon him.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.674" offset="2984744">The language of the statute is that automatic set-aside shall be granted to those youth offenders who are discharged prior to the expiration of the maximum period of probation, theretofore fixed by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.292" offset="3047229">Now, as with any question of statutory construction, it is necessary to go back to the history, structure, and underlying policies of the Youth Act itself, at least briefly because I know the Court is familiar with these matters, to see those... what those who drafted this language intended to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.207" offset="3122880">In its exhaustive review of the Federal Youth Corrections Act in Dorszynski versus United State, this Court found that the principal purpose of the Youth Act is to rehabilitate persons who because of their youth are especially vulnerable to the dangers of recidivism.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.232" offset="3194978">In furtherance of this principal purpose, sentencing judges were authorized to choose from a variety of sentencing options.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.977" offset="3229982">Under Section 5010 of the Act a youth offender may be committed to the custody of the Attorney General for a period up to six years or such longer commitment as may be authorized for an adult violator.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.018" offset="3282122">The youth offender may also be placed on probation with the execution or imposition of his sentence suspended.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.968" offset="3317962">Or the youth may be sentenced as an adult should the Court find he would not benefit from the Youth Act treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.466" offset="3347951">The drafters of the Federal Youth Corrections Act provided a powerful tool to the Youth Act Division to be used in achieving this principal rehabilitative purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.145" offset="3402704">This was the Division's discretion to discharge committed persons unconditionally before it was statutorily required that they do so under the Act because upon such discharge the conviction of the youth would be automatically set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.514" offset="3480131">It was this provision, Section 5021(a), that was before the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in United States versus Arrington.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.462" offset="3519941">There the Court held that a youth offender's unconditional discharge after satisfactorily completing a six-year sentence under Section 5010(b) of the Youth Act set aside his conviction under Section 5021(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="865.629" offset="3584620">As a result, the offender could not be convicted of violating the Federal law which prohibits the possession of firearms by a convicted felon, 18 U.S.C. Section 1202.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.983" offset="3634044">Citing the Court's decision in Dorszynski, the Fifth Circuit stated, if a youthful offender has been unconditionally discharged, the disabilities of a criminal conviction are completely and automatically removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.087" offset="3690469">Indeed, the conviction is set aside as if it never had been.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.287" offset="3707187">The government would have the Court discard Arrington as an aberration, not based upon a complete reading of Section 5021.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.784" offset="3741251">According to the government and the Courts below, Arrington's conviction was not set aside because Arrington was not released prior to the end of his Youth Act sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.529" offset="3788166">The Fifth Circuit determined, however, that because Arrington was given a sentence less than that which he could have been given, his unconditional discharge following the completion of that lesser term earned him the set-aside of his conviction under Section 5021(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="934.475" offset="3859951">The Fifth Circuit's construction of Section 5021 is true to the distinctive character of the Federal Youth Corrections Act as a tool of rehabilitation rather than one of retribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.000" offset="3910106">Petitioner's case is even stronger than John Arrington's.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.813" offset="3925362">Arrington had been committed to the custody of the Attorney General under Section 5010(b) and had received unconditional discharge after completing the six-year maximum term provided by Section 5010(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="965.901" offset="3985652">Petitioner, on the other hand, received unconditional discharge after serving a probationary term of only two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.320" offset="4019402">Now, when the Youth Corrections Act was enacted, no provision whatever was provided whereby youths placed on probation rather than committed could obtain the set-aside of their convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.391" offset="4071647">This waited until 1961 when Section 5021(b) was added to extend the same conviction set-aside benefits to youths serving Youth Act probation as had been available to youths committed under the Federal Youth Corrections Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.167" offset="4138730">Unlike the terms of commitment, however; the Federal Youth Corrections Act specifies no maximum term of probation at the end of which unconditional discharge must occur, nor does it provide for mandatory conditional release prior to the end of that maximum term as is the case for committed youth offenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.702" offset="4228904">The government contends that according to the plain language of the statute the youth must be released prior to the term of probation initially imposed in order to qualify for the set-aside of his conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.807" offset="4293270">This reading of the statute, however, ignores the term 5021 both (a) and (b) for a reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.221" offset="4355024">The reason is to provide a benchmark by which the youth eligibility for the set-aside of his conviction can be measured.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.297" offset="4387311">Unconditional discharge prior to that benchmark grants automatic set-aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.638" offset="4412598">What is the maximum term of probation theretofore fixed as is discussed in petitioner's reply brief?</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.807" offset="4445303">This is not an easy question to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.307" offset="4455334">Petitioner maintains, however, that the drafters of the Federal Youth Corrections Act intended unconditional discharges occurring before six years or such longer period as an adult term may provide to carry with it the set-aside of the conviction underlying that term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.813" offset="4541329">Acceptance of the government's contention would lead to a number of anomalous results.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.915" offset="4605799">An offender discharged before the end of an extended period of probation would be treated better than one discharged at the end of a brief initial period of probation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1178.191" offset="4834841">There is, however, in the language of the statute the term "maximum", in recognition of the anomalies that may result were a person discharged after two years not allowed the set-aside of his conviction and yet a person discharged after five years allowed that set-aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.102" offset="4922508">The term "maximum", which relates back, petitioner contends, to the six years in the original statute, provides a solid benchmark by which all behavior under Federal Youth Corrections Act treatment may be measured, especially in this case where there never was an opportunity for petitioner to be discharged before the end of his two-year probationary term due to the failure of the Probation Department to alert the sentencing Judge to the expiration of his term of probation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1727.667" offset="7032784">--Well, I think... I think it may have to be one day before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.601" offset="7056503">Congress was looking for some evidence of this rehabilitation, and the evidence would be an early set-aside whenever that would come, particularly in the case of a probation with a short sentence, it might take nearly the whole sentence to rehabilitate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.596" offset="7116480">Petitioner was never unconditionally discharged prior to the maximum period of probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.168" offset="7154723">He therefore was never entitled to the set-aside, and the government was fully intent... was fully entitled to use it as a basis for the subsequent recidivist penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.868" offset="7189518">Petitioner attempts to create ambiguity where none exists in this statute by focusing on the statute's use of the word "maximum".</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.617" offset="7220552">and on the absence of any language in the statute such as "the sentence imposed on him".</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.333" offset="7243435">But it is clear from the phraseology of the statute, the period of probation theretofore fixed by the Court, that Congress was talking about the sentence that would be imposed on the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.639" offset="7288679">And Congress could not have more clearly expressed that its use of the word maximum referred to</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.372" offset="7315533">"the maximum period of probation theretofore fixed by the Court. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.150" offset="7334655">In addition, petitioner now suggests that YCA as the maximum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.692" offset="7388885">But in fact, when a court sentences a probationer, the maximum to which he can be sentenced under 3651 in the Federal Courts and also in the D.C. Courts is five years' probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.235" offset="7443011">So according to petitioner's theory, any... any probationer would ultimately be entitled to set-aside relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.371" offset="7471536">As I mentioned to Justice Blackmun, it was Congress' purpose in... in... in holding out the possibility of a set-aside to induce probationers, to induce all youth offenders, to take advantage of the treatment and guidance that was offered by the YCA program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.927" offset="7549799">Accordingly, any construction of the statute that makes the availability of set-aside relief turn on the initial sentence as imposed would... would thwart that congressional purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.625" offset="7600581">And it's for that reason, as well as the more significant fact that its conclusion flies in the face of the statutory language, that the Arrington decision on which petitioner relies and which is the only decision contrary to the holding below is of no persuasive force at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.177" offset="7666828">While the case... while this case here presents... involves the set-aside provision applicable to probationers, Arrington involved the analogous set-aside provision applicable to committed youth offenders; that is, incarcerated youth offenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.217" offset="7726909">That section provides,</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.542" offset="7736209">"Upon the unconditional discharge by the commission of a committed youth offender before the expiration of the maximum sentence imposed upon him, the conviction shall be automatically set aside. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.678" offset="7780826">Notwithstanding this clear statutory language, the Fifth Circuit in Arrington held that the defendant there, who had completed his... the six-year sentence that was imposed upon him was entitled to a set-aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.189" offset="7838818">That Fifth Circuit decision represents nothing less than a holding that every defendant who is sentenced under the Youth Corrections Act will ultimately be entitled to a set-aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.764" offset="7881136">Petitioner complains that we are... that we interpret the Arrington decision too broadly, that really all that the Fifth Circuit was holding was that any youth offender who was committed to a sentence less than that to which he could have been committed will be entitled to a set-aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.301" offset="7959295">But there is no basis for petitioner's reading of the Arrington decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.754" offset="7977058">In the first place, the Fifth Circuit never articulated such a limited ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.050" offset="7998269">Indeed, it never even discussed the critical statutory language prior... before the expiration of the maximum term imposed upon him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.605" offset="8032542">And moreover, the petitioner's reading of the Fifth Circuit's decision makes no sense at all, as a hypothetical will show.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.557" offset="8064307">If you take two defendants, both of whom are sentenced to six years youth... to six years under 50... Section 5010(b) of the Youth Corrections Act, one of the defendants has committed a string of murders, the other one has been convicted of loitering.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.691" offset="8132852">Under... under petitioner's reading of the Arrington decision, the only defendant who would be entitled to set-aside relief would be the mass murderer because only he could have been sentenced to a greater sentence; that is, under Section 5017(c), he could have been sentenced to the maximum... to a youth offender sentence equivalent to the maximum sentence an adult could have received.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.964" offset="8221982">But in any event, either reading of the Arrington decision ignores the critical statutory before the expiration of the maximum sentence imposed on him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.098" offset="8266495">Moreover, either meaning makes the unavailability of set-aside relief turn on the sentence as initially imposed, and therefore it thwarts the congressional purpose of it holding out the set-aside as an inducement to the youth offenders to take advantage of YCA treatment in correctional programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.451" offset="8351863">If the Court has no further questions, I will rely on our brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="2084.516" offset="8460114">Petitioner does not maintain that any probationer would be entitled to set-aside relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.280" offset="8487177">As the Justice pointed out, it is plain that Congress was looking for evidence of rehabilitation and that this was necessary in order to qualify for the set-aside of the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.025" offset="8546214">It was not to be a benefit indiscriminately bestowed upon everyone under the Federal Youth Corrections Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.505" offset="8572127">In looking for the evidence of rehabilitation, the government would suggest, according to a strict reading of all of the statute except one word, that it must have happened one day or five days or any time prior to the period of that probationary term.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.106" offset="8654465">Aside from the fact that, as we know in this case, there never was even an opportunity for that to happen, this turns the rehabilitative purposes of the Act on its head.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.790" offset="8709218">The more reasonable reading, more in line with the policy of the Act, a more better gauge of evidence of rehabilitation would be was the petitioner, was the youth offender discharged prior to the six years under which... specified in Section 5010(b) of the Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.748" offset="8797094">If the Court would determine that in fact the maximum is the five-year probationary term provided in the Federal probation statute, that would be acceptable as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.542" offset="8840248">But there is most definitely a reference in the statute to some maximum as the benchmark.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.931" offset="8861773">This is to how the evidence of rehabilitation is to be determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.521" offset="8880163">And only if that evidence is demonstrated would set-aside be in order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.035" offset="8902211">In this case, that evidence is demonstrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.016" offset="8918198">And petitioner would urge that conviction and the decision of the Court of Appeals below be reversed.</text>
