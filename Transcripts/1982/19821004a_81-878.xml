            <text syncTime="60.271" offset="391965">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="63.020" offset="402936">This case raises a question concerning the state's power to regulate alcoholic beverages.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.298" offset="428014">The state law at issue is Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 138, Section 16(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="76.310" offset="456122">That statute prohibits the issuance of a liquor license to any establishment located within 500 feet of a church or school if the church or school objects to the issuance of the license.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.649" offset="513487">The Massachusetts Supreme Court addressed the issues presented here and upheld the constitutionality of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.520" offset="548909">The First Circuit Court of Appeals concurred in that ruling, but reversed itself in an en banc decision which is now the subject of this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.517" offset="588928">The First Circuit ruled that Section 16(c) violates the establishment clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.185" offset="627589">In the First Circuit's view, the statute has the primary effect of advancing religion because it extends to churches but not to all similarly situated institutions a more than de minimis benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.367" offset="684327">In defense of the en banc decision, Grendel's advances an alternative rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.925" offset="714525">In Grendel's view, the statute improperly delegates legislative power to churches and thereby violates the establishment clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.435" offset="752559">The state contends that Section 16(c) embodies a legislative effort to accommodate competing interests and to control the placement of liquor licenses in Massachusetts.</text>

            <text syncTime="188.935" offset="906577">Initially, the case was brought as applied and facially, I might point out.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.982" offset="934789">When it was filed in the district court, it was filed both as an as applied attack to the challenge and a facial challenge to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.088" offset="967181">The district court, after Grendel's... the Commonwealth moved to dismiss and asked the district court to abstain on the as applied section of the complaint, the district court denied our motion to dismiss, we then entered into an agreement of facts and contested claims with Grendel's.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.515" offset="1072925">Those claims were due process, establishment clause, and equal protection, and the Sherman Act claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="241.430" offset="1116602">--Well, in view of all of our talking in our opinions about how at least this Court, and I think we've said other federal courts too, should first address statutory claims before they reach constitutional claims, isn't it a little odd that the First Circuit addressed constitutional claims and didn't resolve the statutory claim?</text>

            <text syncTime="2682.540" offset="10880964">There's another kind of as-applied claim, which is to suggest that in this case the veto was applied either to exact contributions for the church or to advance the church's religious beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.519" offset="10928925">Now, what we suggest is that either of those grounds is highly problematic, the second because of the entanglement involved in the inquiry into the motives of the church and the first because the invalidity of this blank check of absolute veto power that is handed to the church does not depend upon the facts of the particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.836" offset="11018159">If the state wants, as the State of Massachusetts purports to want, to allow the views of churches to be weighed and considered in making judgments that accommodate religious needs, it has ample means for doing that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2941.432" offset="11916563">And therefore the harm that we sought relief from, the denial of the license, was harm that could be removed only by seeking declaratory or injunctive relief against these state officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.303" offset="11960030">The power that was exercised here, and I think this is important in light of Justice Rehnquist's question about New Motor v. Fox, was not just the power to trigger a public inquiry.</text>

            <text syncTime="2982.150" offset="12079462">The effect is absolutely and totally, as the State Supreme Court ruled and as the State Commissioners of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission said, absolutely to veto the license permanently.</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence H. Tribe</label>
            <text syncTime="3519.492" offset="14228817">That was once.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.412" offset="14232474">The reason I think they've rarely been cited is that most people have followed them and obeyed them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.880" offset="14250342">That is, the effrontery of a state in deciding that the livelihood of a restaurant in Harvard Square is going to depend on one property owner's whim is something that this Court has happily been spared in most cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.982" offset="14302796">This case is worse in a very special way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.514" offset="14312931">In all of those cases where the Court has gone in various ways depending on factual nuances, at least it could be said that a neighborhood of owners got to vote somehow on whether a particular use would be allowed or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.431" offset="14368625">Never in this Court have we been confronted with a situation where one owner has a decisive veto power over an otherwise lawful activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.207" offset="14415645">And why someone who is subjected to that veto should have to go through a trial and psychoanalyze the reasons the veto was exercised, something that as a last resort we would be willing to do, before the obvious constitutional question is disposed of, is really beyond me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.014" offset="14474891">I don't think anything would be gained by it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3595.009" offset="14530897">Well, is it distinguishable if we apply the interpretation of Section 16(c) given it by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court?</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence H. Tribe</label>
            <text syncTime="3606.252" offset="14575828">Well, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court interpreted the purposes of the waiver as... of the current veto, which they describe specifically in their opinion as a veto.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.467" offset="14628700">They said this is the delegation of a veto power at page 175A of the Jurisdictional Statement Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.587" offset="14649180">They said its purpose is really no different from that of a waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.272" offset="14671958">It seems to me that this Court's cases... and it's not up to the State Supreme Court to interpret them... establish that it's not the underlying purpose of the choice between waiver and veto that counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.098" offset="14715217">What counts is that other private parties have been given the power to dispose of the fate of other private parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3648.206" offset="14743638">But even if Cusack were controlling and one said this is a waiver, there'd be a fundamental difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3652.936" offset="14762551">In Cusack, the owners of over half the property in the area had to vote on the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.216" offset="14783763">It was a little like the referendum case in which the Chief Justice upheld spot zoning by the City of Eastlake.</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.869" offset="14810303">This Court could well hold that the question of when property owners as a collectivity can be given a kind of local option over the entry of nonconforming uses, such as a billboard in a residential area, is a difficult and different question from the question when one property owner, not involved in Cusack or Roberge or Eubank, can unilaterally dispose of how others may use their property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3690.952" offset="14914688">That question it seems to me can lead to only one answer if the due process clause is to mean rule of law rather than subjection to someone else's whim and will.</text>
