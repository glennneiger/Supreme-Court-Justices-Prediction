            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="114.669" offset="607567">I am not sure whether the respondents raised it.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.138" offset="625434">Since we had won on that issue in the Fourth Circuit, we did not consider presenting it here, and never inquired into whether it was briefed in the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.868" offset="652393">The Fourth Circuit seemed to assume without too much difficulty that Kennison, the fellow at issue here, had been convicted when he pleaded guilty in Iowa state court, as I hope to get to in a minute, as I briefly explain the statement of facts here.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.708" offset="707772">David Kennison is the chairman of the board of directors and a substantial stockholder of the respondent, New Banner Institute.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.594" offset="743299">In 1974, he was arrested and charged with kidnapping in Iowa, and pursuant to a plea bargain, the kidnapping charge was dismissed, but he pleaded guilty to the charge of carrying a concealed weapon, which is a felony punishable by five years' imprisonment in Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.742" offset="827831">The trial judge in Iowa accepted the guilty plea, deferred the entry of judgment, and sentenced Kennison to probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.239" offset="861895">Kennison was then allowed to leave Iowa and go home to South Carolina, where he served his period of probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.767" offset="895959">At the end of the probationary period, which appears to have been one year, Kennison called up the Iowa authorities, announced that he had successfully completed the term of probation, and he had not been arrested during that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.183" offset="945591">And then the Iowa court, under the Iowa expunction statute, automatically dismissed the... released Kennison and did not enter judgment, ordered his criminal record expunged.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.804" offset="1000135">Now, a few months later, New Banner Institute applies for three licenses from the Secretary of the Treasury in order to deal in firearms and manufacture ammunition.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.345" offset="1042244">New Banner did not list on the application that one of its chief stockholders and officers had been convicted of a felony, and these three licenses were issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.247" offset="1085921">Shortly thereafter, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms learned of Kennison's Iowa conviction, and served notice of its intent to revoke the licenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.087" offset="1133255">After a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge, the director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms found that Kennison had been convicted of a disqualifying offense under state law, and that Kennison had the power to direct the management and policies of New Banner Institute.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.407" offset="1206502">Therefore, the Director ordered New Banner's licenses revoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.187" offset="1225624">The... New Banner sought judicial review, and the district court upheld the revocation order, but the Fourth Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.057" offset="1257180">The court of appeals agreed, as I said a moment ago, that Kennison had been convicted when he pleaded guilty in Iowa court to the felony, and therefore the federal firearms disabilities had been triggered at that point, but the Fourth Circuit believed that since that offense had been expunged under state law, it could no longer serve as a predicate for the imposition of penalties or disabilities under the Gun Control Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.891" offset="1368461">Therefore, the Fourth Circuit ordered the director to issue the licenses, these three licenses, to New Banner Institute under the federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.809" offset="1404197">Now, the Bureau revoked New Banner's licenses in this case under the provisions of Section 923(d)(1)(B) of the statute, which prohibits the issuance of a license to anyone who is disabled from transporting, shipping, or receiving firearms or ammunition under Sections 922(g) or (h) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.063" offset="1513180">Sections 922(g) or (h) in turn make it unlawful for an person, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="348.764" offset="1544004">"who has been convicted in any court of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year to transport, ship, or receive a firearm or ammunition. "</text>
            <text syncTime="361.492" offset="1594891">Now, it's the government's position that Kennison, by virtue of the undisputed finding that he pleaded guilty to a felony in Iowa in 1974 is a person who "has been convicted" within the meaning of this section.</text>

            <text syncTime="397.618" offset="1739400">The question that we presented in the petition is whether the subsequent expungement of that conviction under state law for reasons having nothing to do with innocence or legal error serves to remove the federal disabilities.</text>

            <text syncTime="426.216" offset="1853817">Well, that strikes me as a rather strange proposition for the government to argue, unless you simply mean that it is a federal question and federal law refers to the laws of the several states.</text>

            <text syncTime="1023.484" offset="4242871">So presumably Congress did not want to allow gubernatorial parties to relieve defendants of the disabilities imposed by federal law, yet the Fourth Circuit has held that state expungements, which may be less of an indication that the defendant is a responsible person than a gubernatorial pardon, relieve the defendant of those... of those important federal disabilities.</text>

            <text syncTime="1121.900" offset="4636484">Congress empowered the Secretary of the Treasury to grant relief from the disabilities of the Act in selected cases, but at the same time Congress restricted the Secretary's authority in a number of significant ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.817" offset="4684132">First, relief under Section 925(c) can't be granted to anyone convicted of a crime involving the use of a firearm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.782" offset="4720076">Second, before relief can be granted under Section 925(c), it has to be established to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the circumstances regarding the applicant's conviction and his record and reputation are such that the applicant will not be likely to act in a manner dangerous to the public safety, and that the granting of relief, i.e., allowing him to deal with firearms, would not be contrary to the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.599" offset="4827283">Congress wrote that right into the statute, and the Secretary must make this precise finding after an individualized inquiry every time he grants relief from the disabilities of the Act, and under Section 925(c), whenever the Secretary grants relief, he has to promptly publish notice of that fact in the Federal Register.</text>

            <text syncTime="1199.976" offset="4948804">The Secretary is disabled from granting relief in that situation, but look at the anomalies that would arise if the Fourth Circuit were correct, because state officials would, even though Congress carefully circumscribed the power of the Secretary to grant relief from the firearms disabilities imposed by the Act, state officials would have unfettered discretion to accomplish even more than Congress authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="1506.867" offset="6176350">This is an important federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.396" offset="6182515">The Court has remarked on that many times, and I needn't remind the Court of the history that gave rise to Title IV and Title VII of the Omnibus Crime Control Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.032" offset="6221072">Congress was not cavalier about allowing people who were convicted of felonies to carry firearms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.687" offset="6251688">It imposed a disability on these people, and it allowed the Secretary of the Treasury, a cabinet level federal official, to remove that disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.527" offset="6287005">It didn't, we think, mean to allow state officials using unfettered discretion across the country and not making any inquiry into whether the person could be trusted to carry a firearm to relieve the disabilities of the Gun Control Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.052" offset="6345101">Now, I just want to make one more point before I reserve time for rebuttal, and that is that if the Court agrees with the Fourth Circuit, if it says that effect must be given to state expungements, then it is going to have to confront the much more difficult question of exactly what effect is to be given to these various expungement statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.937" offset="6424618">Nearly half the states have expungement statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.448" offset="6434649">They are a bewildering array.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.370" offset="6442381">They are... They vary in almost every single particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.305" offset="6458159">Now, when a state convicts someone of a crime, it imposes on that defendant a bundle of disabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.584" offset="6483237">It would be quite bizarre if by expunging only a portion of those disabilities, federal courts were willing to remove the disabilities imposed by Congress under the Gun Control Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.033" offset="6533079">Therefore, it would seem that there would have to be an individualized inquiry by the federal courts in every single case to see whether what remains after the expungement is still considered a conviction for federal gun control purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.620" offset="6587413">Now, this would be, we think, chaotic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.589" offset="6595250">It would lead to massive confusion in enforcement of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.353" offset="6610297">No one would know what their legal status is if they had an expunged conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.697" offset="6627746">The Fourth Circuit here masked those difficulties by calling the Iowa expungement statute absolute and unconditional, where we think that is plainly incorrect for reasons we have discussed in our reply brief, but even if it were true in the case of the Iowa statute, there were dozens and dozens of other expunction statutes out there, and if we had to give effect to those expunction statutes under federal law, the situation would be chaotic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.296" offset="6722101">The Secretary of the Treasury would not know whether he could grant a license to someone who had an expunged conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.153" offset="6745506">The gun dealers would not know whether they would be committing a crime by selling a firearm to someone with an expunged conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.540" offset="6771106">Law enforcement officers would not know whether someone with an expunged conviction would be committing a crime by carrying a firearm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.412" offset="6798587">And the defendant himself would not know what his legal status is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.880" offset="6816455">We think that Congress could not have intended to allow such an ambiguous and confusing situation to occur in the enforcement of an extremely important federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.171" offset="6857624">What we think Congress meant was that when someone has been adjudicated guilty of a serious crime, he falls within the disabilities of the federal Act, and if he is to be relieved of those disabilities, it is to be done by application to the Secretary of the Treasury, followed by public notice of that fact, and not in the helter-skelter fashion that the Fourth Circuit seems to envision involving dozens and dozens of state expungements by officers, giving no thought at all to whether the person should continue to be disabled under federal law.</text>
