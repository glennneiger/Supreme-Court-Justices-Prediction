            <text syncTime="78.141" offset="466704">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the Petitioner in this case urges this Court to hold that the American Postal Workers Union, which has been adjudicated in this case to have violated its duty of fair representation to the appellant, in fact in this case held to have done so maliciously, recklessly, and in callous disregard of his rights, be held responsible to Bowen for that portion of his increased wage loss which occurred while he was seeking the redress in the courts which the union has been found to have been responsible for seeking for him through the process of arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.356" offset="655517">This case presents the Court with all the parties and with the necessary evidential underpinnning with which to refine the apportionment of damage test or principles which this Court has enunciated in a long line of cases beginning with Vaca versus Sipes, extending down to Czosek versus O'Mara, and to Hines versus Anchor Motor Freight, and at least by passing reference in two cases last year, the Clayton case and the Mitchell case, both being Section 301 cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.637" offset="804624">We think that this Court has been consistent, although it has not met this issue squarely, in holding that the apportionment of responsibility in these cases between the employer and the union should be predicated upon relative fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.458" offset="879961">The Court in Vaca and I think the Court in subsequent decisions has indicated that the union should not be responsible for those damages that have been caused by the employer, nor should the employer be held responsible for those damages caused by the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.482" offset="956030">The closest decision that this Court has had to the case immediately before you is the Hines versus Anchor Motor Freight case.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.292" offset="991243">There, the Court did not have to meet this issue head on, although it was clear that it was going to have to be met on remand, and you will recall that Justice Stewart in a concurring opinion which was not dissented from by any member of the Court, expressed his belief that the apportionment of loss of wages in that case should be made on the basis of fault, and that the employer who had achieved a successful arbitration award in that case should not be held responsible for any damages that had accrued subsequent to the arbitration award and prior to the time that there would be a determination of... an untainted determination of the employee's rights and his determination that he should return to work.</text>

            <label>Mr. William B. Poff</label>
            <text syncTime="281.449" offset="1279948">--I would not think you reticent to do so if you saw fit, but in this instance, at least, I think it is fair to comment at least that that statement was made by Justice Stewart, and I have seen nothing to indicate disagreement with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.834" offset="1333447">I would suggest that the fact that you do have the National Labor Relations Board in this kind of setting, in unfair labor practice cases, 8B cases, assessing back wage responsibility against unions indicates that there is certainly nothing anathema as far as national labor policy is concerned against assessing back wages in these kinds of situations where unions have failed to represent employees fairly.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.476" offset="1487987">There is nothing wrong with the national labor policy in assessing back wages, because in fact Section 10(c) of the National Labor Relations Act expressly authorizes the National Labor Relations Board to remedy cases, discrimination cases in that fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.514" offset="1556219">In order to adopt the position that the APWU asserts in this case would, we suggest, emasculate the very purpose of the duty of fair representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.974" offset="1645976">There are in these cases, we suggest, only about three elements of damages that can ever be assessed against a union for a breach of its duty of fair representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.471" offset="1692056">One would be the possibility of back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.001" offset="1702087">A second would be attorneys' fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.969" offset="1710028">A third would be court costs and related items of damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.527" offset="1732180">If the union is successful in the position in this case that it is in no event liable for back pay responsibility, that only leaves attorneys' fees and court costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.476" offset="1780036">Attorneys' fees, as was suggested no later than last term with the Summit Valley Industries case, a secondary boycott case in which this Court refused to impose attorneys' fees against unions, and reiterated the American rule, it is unlikely that you will ever have or that you will often have a situation such as this, where you do have a bad faith finding below which would justify the imposition of even attorneys' fees against unions, and unless this Court is going to carve out an exception or unfair representation cases in the attorneys' fee area, another exception to the American rule, then attorneys' fees themselves would not in cases... in most cases of unfair representation be an element of damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.614" offset="1968536">That would leave only a court cost type of figure, which in the present case might be indicative of what you could expect in other cases, $1,463 divided jointly, so a liability would be imposed upon the union which would be miniscule, which would in fact be less than the cost that they would incur to have processed the grievance properly to begin with.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.604" offset="2060591">So, we suggest that to accept the position of the American Postal Workers Union in this case is to render the duty of fair representation, a duty without any sanctions to enforce it, because--</text>

            <text syncTime="492.504" offset="2124121">Mr. Poff, don't you think that if there is any requirement of egregiousness in order to find that a union has breached the duty of fair representation, that many of those will be accompanied by a finding of malice or bad faith?</text>
            <text syncTime="505.313" offset="2175426">I mean, negligence, I would think, wouldn't be sufficient to support a finding of liability against the union.</text>

            <text syncTime="510.247" offset="2195070">--You will recall, sir, that in Vaca and Sipes, two tests are really stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.246" offset="2215132">There is the arbitrary and perfunctory standard referred to on one occasion and the arbitrary bad faith and discriminatory language in another.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.540" offset="2248255">I think it has generally been accepted that the appropriate rule is arbitrary bad faith or discriminatory conduct by unions to constitute unfair representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.800" offset="2285349">Certainly, if there is... there have been cases, however, which have gone off on essentially a negligence standard, relying upon the Court's arbitrary and perfunctory language, and I would suggest that in those cases, that would not be a necessary finding of fault on the part of the union to justify the imposition of attorneys' fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.106" offset="2354521">And therefore, if the result urged in this case by the appellee is successful, then the duty of fair representation which was judicially created to achieve some balance and responsibility in this area will be rendered of no effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.303" offset="2431321">There is also, of course, the national labor policy which is well recognized in support of the arbitral process, and we would submit that the... that employers in this context submit to an arbitration agreement with the thought that they will act as they deem appropriate under the facts of an individual case, that the union will, if it deems it necessary, grieve, and that this matter will then ultimately be settled by arbitration within a relatively and... a time frame that can be relatively... be ascertained and predicted with some degree of certainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.660" offset="2604774">If, as in this case, the union can by failing to take a case to arbitration expand indefinitely the period of lost wage exposure that an employer has, then the employer's intentions in entering into this collective bargaining agreement with a grievance and arbitration process will have been thwarted.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.620" offset="2688575">He did not in essence bargain for an indefinite expansion of his liability, which brings us specifically to the facts of this case, which are unusual in the many district court, circuit court cases that have developed since Vaca versus Sipes.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.817" offset="2761404">This case does come to the Court with sound underpinning as to when an arbitration award would have been rendered that would have returned this employee to his employment, and the trial court below made the specific finding that the employer should bear the back wage responsibility, some $17,000, from the time of termination until the time that an arbitration award would have returned him to his employment, and that subsequent to that time, until there was a judicial holding or until there was a jury finding that he should be returned to work, this period of time having occurred, and this loss of wage having occurred because of the union's reckless, as the jury found, malicious, callous disregard of Bowen's rights to take his case to arbitration, that that period of time was the union's responsibility, and some $30,000 in wages were assessed against the APWU on that basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="736.955" offset="3101937">And we think that the APWU and unions of like position should not be able to expand an employer's liability for back pay indefinitely by breaching this duty of fair representation.</text>

            <text syncTime="791.759" offset="3321156">However, we are, as you know, confronted with a Fourth Circuit holding that because we did not note cross appeal from the verdict below, which we deem to be totally favorable, and did not see any need to cross appeal from, because of that and because of a footnote that was added to this decision some four months after the initial decision was rendered in our favor, we did not think we would be here in this posture.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.061" offset="3426377">The footnote brought us here because it took away the $30,000 of the Postal Workers Union's damages that would otherwise have been paid by the Postal Service by saying they would not disturb the trial court's apportionment of some $22,964.12 to the Postal Service because we had not noted an appeal as to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.724" offset="3521045">So, for that reason, it is a matter of some considerable concern to us.</text>

            <text syncTime="850.517" offset="3556154">Well, sir, I think that our point with regard to the actions of the Fourth Circuit in belatedly amending its decision to take $30,000 away from us is one that has been adequately briefed, and I do not desire to discuss that at any great length with the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.180" offset="3642880">We do, however, certainly take the position that if the APWU is excused from paying any share of lost wages suffered by Bowen, that he does remain entitled to a full compensatory award from the Postal Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.707" offset="3692931">The Smith versus Evening News analysis which the union engages in apparently in an effort to reach the result that no back wages should be awarded against the union in any unfair representation case except one perhaps where they conspire initially with the employer, it seems to us inapposite because, first of all, Smith was not an unfair representation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.851" offset="3817483">It did not involve a case with a grievance and arbitration procedure, and as this Court suggested last term in United Parcel Service versus Mitchell, in which you held... we are dealing with a statute of limitations question with a Section 301 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.688" offset="3888849">You in language in that case point out that it is not appropriate to analyze this kind of case on a pure breach of contract theory, because once you get the tripartite hybrid procedure of employer, employee, and union, in a Section 301 setting, with the threshold question being whether there has been a breach of the duty of fair representation by the union, that it is not a true breach of contract case any longer, that it is a, I believe, in the words of this Court, a creature of labor law, and so we think that for these reasons, that the rationale of the APWU in its brief is fallacious and flawed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1003.472" offset="4168046">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the right of an employer to rely on the union to bring any breach by it to its attention within the context of the grievance process so that the employer can rectify its wrong and prevent the accrual of additional damages is inherent in the collective bargaining system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.758" offset="4269192">As this Court frequently has recognized, a collective bargaining agreement that contains a grievance arbitration provision is far more than an ordinary contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.458" offset="4307958">The grievance process itself defines the rights under the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.815" offset="4329378">It is the vehicle by which meaning and content are given to that agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.829" offset="4345470">Indeed, the Court has described the grievance procedure as part of the ongoing collective bargaining process between the union and the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.090" offset="4374518">Accordingly, an act that may be an apparent violation of the contractual provisions is not a breach of them until it is determined to be such within the context of the grievance machinery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.680" offset="4424882">If it is at that point liability will be assessed to the breaching party who took the action that it did with the full knowledge that its conduct might subsequently in the grievance process be found to constitute a breach.</text>

            <text syncTime="1418.556" offset="5828389">And that is because... and that is because it doesn't arise out of tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.539" offset="5848242">It arises out of the national labor policy, which is that rights are only defined within the grievance procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.802" offset="5881365">A collective bargaining agreement itself may be violated, but the breach itself isn't determined until it is within... within the grievance process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.420" offset="5931834">In Hines, Justice Stewart stated in his concurring opinion that once a grievance process is exhausted, the employer's failure to reinstate discharged employees cannot be anything but rightful until there is a contrary determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.352" offset="5995573">There is no difference in result whether, as in Hines, an abrital award is rendered in favor of the employer, or until the time for processing the grievance has expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.630" offset="6036637">So the point is that there is no breach of the collective bargaining agreement unless such a breach is found in the context of the grievance process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.455" offset="6067984">In other words, the unique feature of the grievance arbitration process, the fact that it is the vehicle for the determination of the substantive rights under the collective bargaining agreement distinguishes an action on a collective bargaining agreement containing such a provision from suit on an ordinary contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.462" offset="6139977">In the latter case, damages continue to accrue up to the time of trial, because it is only at trial that the rights of the parties are determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.366" offset="6175608">By contrast, where a grievance procedure is available to the parties, their rights can be determined substantially earlier, so that all parties can conform their conduct to that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.471" offset="6220017">Accordingly, where because of the union's wrongs the employer's breach is not brought to its attention in the context of the grievance procedure, it is only fair that the union bear those additional damages that flow from the malfunctioning of the grievance machinery which it caused.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.353" offset="6291488">Therefore, in Hines versus Anchor Motor Freight, Justice Stewart explained that the union, not the employer, would be liable for back wages accruing subsequent to an arbitral award that was erroneously rendered in favor of the employer because of the union's breach of its duty of fair representation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1561.435" offset="6399844">The union argues that imposing liability on it for lost wages will have a chilling effect on the exercise of its discretion to settle employee grievances short of arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.493" offset="6448118">In the first place, a rule that imposes liability on an employer for these damages may chill its right to discharge employees whom the collective bargaining agreement would entitle it to dismiss, thus modifying the parties' rights under the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.207" offset="6506946">In any event, the union's contention that the apportionment rule we urge would force it to arbitrate even frivolous grievances for fear that if it did not, it might be assessed back wages, is unfounded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.325" offset="6567445">In Vaca, the Court made clear that a union can breach its duty of fair representation only by conduct that is arbitrary, discriminatory, or in bad faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.729" offset="6597016">For example, here the jury found that the union had acted maliciously, recklessly, or in callous disregard of petitioner's rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="1742.378" offset="7123644">--Yes, sir, and that employer in this particular case and in every case makes a decision to discharge an employee for just cause, and through three steps of the grievance machinery, the employer persists in that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.185" offset="7190831">Then the union in this particular case agrees with the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.838" offset="7209431">He says, you have convinced us that this employee has violated his duty to the employer, and he is subject to discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.584" offset="7252480">Now, the employer and the union in that case have applied the grievance machinery, have decided in their judgment, which turns out to have been a wrong judgment, decided later on by a jury, that the employee was justly discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.140" offset="7314652">Now the question is, shall the union be held liable because it agreed with the employer that the employee was justly discharged, a decision which they did not come to until a jury later on determined that there was a breach of the duty of fair representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.821" offset="7381421">Now, I think that the union does have an interest... the employer does have an interest, and that the interest of the employer is at all times, especially since Vaca, to make sure that it has discharged the employee if it is a discharge only for just cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.971" offset="7449966">I do not think that the intervening damage or the intervening act or wrongdoing of the union, a wrong committed against the employee, not against the employer, should in any way absolve the employer from his wrongdoing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.697" offset="7528960">It is just as if a culprit who was slashing away at his victim states that but for the failure of the police to intervene in a timely manner, his knife would not have reached the throat of the victim, and therefore the police are responsible for any of the responsibility beyond the time when they should have been there and the culprit is liable only for mayhem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.216" offset="7642959">Now, that principle is clear in the law of torts, and there is no reason... and the law of trusts, and there is no reason why it shouldn't be applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.869" offset="7677649">As Prosser stated it, where one tort feasor by his act or conduct has created a danger to the plaintiffs and the other has merely failed to discover or to remedy it, indemnity will lie in favor of the second tort feasor.</text>
