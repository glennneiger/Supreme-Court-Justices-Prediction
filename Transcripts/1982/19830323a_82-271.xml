            <label>Mr. John G. De Gooyer</label>
            <text syncTime="87.509" offset="493343">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, nine years ago this Court, in American Pipe and Construction Company versus Utah, held that the statute of limitations is temporarily suspended in federal class actions until the District Court determines whether to certify the class.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.156" offset="588011">The issue in the case before the Court this morning is whether the rule of American Pipe applies to federal class actions brought under the Civil Rights Act of 1866.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.464" offset="633255">We think the answer to that is clearly yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.913" offset="651018">A number of lower courts have held that it applies, and only one court to our knowledge, and that is the court below in the instant case, has held that it does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.974" offset="691247">The relevant facts are few and undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.143" offset="707965">The Respondents are teachers in the Department of Education of Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.986" offset="727296">During the 1976-1977 school year, they held temporary one-year administrative positions in the department.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.810" offset="762614">Toward the end of that year, they received formal notification that their appointments would not be renewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.947" offset="791139">Approximately one year later, in June of 1978, a teacher who had received notification of non-reappointment, Mr. Jose Ortiz Rivera, who is not a respondent in this case, brought an action in the Federal District Court in Puerto Rico as a class action on behalf of himself and a class of persons who he contended had been victims of discrimination on account of their political beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.904" offset="907018">Relief was sought under 42 United States Code Section 1983, and pendent state claims were asserted.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.027" offset="939515">The defendants were the petitioners in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.478" offset="953307">It is undisputed that as of the date Ortiz Rivera filed his class action, the statute of limitations had not yet run against the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.490" offset="997298">Approximately two months after the lawsuit had been filed, the District Court denied class certification on the grounds that the class was not so numerous as to make joinder impracticable.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.811" offset="1050587">It is undisputed that thereafter none of the respondents took any action on their own behalf to press their claims against the petitioners for five months, until January of 1979, when they brought individual lawsuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.618" offset="1117879">The petitioners filed answers in each case, and in each answer asserted as an affirmative defense that the statute of limitations had run.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.866" offset="1158839">Eventually, the cases were consolidated for trial, bifurcated on the issue of liability and damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.627" offset="1189872">The District Court reserved decision on the limitations issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.264" offset="1204396">The cases were tried in January of 1981, and verdicts were entered for the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.497" offset="1233340">Judgment was finally entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.510" offset="1241386">On appeal, the First Circuit found that the respondents' actions had been timely filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.665" offset="1270016">Although the Court recognized that if the rule of American Pipe and Construction Company were applied here, the statute of limitations would have been suspended when Ortiz Rivera filed his lawsuit, but that it would have resumed running when class certification was denied, and that the statute would have expired as to each respondent before and indeed well before his individual action was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.466" offset="1377223">The court concluded, however, that it could not apply American Pipe and Construction Company because of this Court's decision in Board of Regents versus Tomanio, and the court below specifically held on the basis of that decision that the rule of American Pipe and Construction does not apply to cases brought under Section 1983 of Title 42.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.675" offset="1466039">Instead, the court felt constrained to look to state law to find the tolling rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.672" offset="1490071">Even though when the court looked to state law, or Puerto Rico law, it found, and I quote, "no discernible state rule" applicable to class actions, it fashioned a rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.589" offset="1545660">It fashioned a rule by borrowing the aspect of American Pipe and Construction Company, that aspect of the rule that filing of a class suit tolls the running of the statute of limitations, and then it found that when class certification was denied, a Puerto Rico rule applicable in other circumstances came into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.799" offset="1630506">Under that rule, the entire original statutory period of limitations began to run anew.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.641" offset="1653911">Each respondent therefore had another year within which to bring a lawsuit, even though at the time the class suit had been filed most of them had about three weeks left remaining in their statutory period.</text>

            <text syncTime="397.258" offset="1732383">It was that the... this Court's decision in Board of Regents versus Tomanio interpreting Section 1988 mandated state law and not federal law applied.</text>

            <label>Mr. John G. De Gooyer</label>
            <text syncTime="435.992" offset="1887342">--I agree with your statement that the opinion so reads.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.149" offset="1895910">I disagree with the notion that the American Pipe rule, the suspension aspect of the American Pipe rule is in any way dependent upon the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.473" offset="1933213">There are numerous lower court cases, and of course they are not controlling, but there are numerous cases cited in our brief where lower courts have used the suspension rule in Title 7 cases, in various kinds of cases, securities cases, but more importantly to me, at least, was this Court's decision in United Airlines versus McDonald.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.483" offset="2009281">That case was decided three and a half years after American Pipe and Construction Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.649" offset="2029970">In that case, and it was a Title 7 case, the eight members of the court that decided that case all sat on the American Pipe court, which was unanimously decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.053" offset="2071557">The issue in the United Airlines case was whether or not American Pipe and Construction Company had any application, and while the majority and the minority disagreed as to the scope of the rule, no one disputed the fact that the rule would have applicability in a Title 7 case, and indeed the minority so stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.060" offset="2147626">So, I don't have any problem with that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.699" offset="2162150">I think there is no limitation there.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.480" offset="2169255">Contrary to what the First Circuit held, we believe that the American Pipe rule controls this case, that it is a uniform rule of federal procedure, that it applies generally to all class actions, regardless of subject matter and regardless of the statute of limitations that is applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.486" offset="2245324">And as I have just discussed, I think that the Clayton Act in no way gave the rule its suspension aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.187" offset="2280119">At the same time, we do not believe that the rule is two rules, as the respondents contend.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.500" offset="2305405">There is no basis in the American Pipe opinion for that, in my judgment, and no court has ever held that this is actually two rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.150" offset="2335916">Suspension by its very meaning means stopping temporarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.399" offset="2356919">This is consistent with what the Court was doing in establishing the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.380" offset="2372906">It was protecting the District Court from a flurry of activity while it decided whether to certify the class.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.270" offset="2400387">As the Court said in American Pipe, Rule 23 is eviscerated if people will be coming in, filing protective motions to intervene while the Court is deciding whether it is a class or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.437" offset="2441138">Suspension fully satisfies the needs of judicial efficiency and economy while preserving the rights and obligations of the parties as of the date the class suit was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.667" offset="2486068">The analogy I use is, it is snapshot.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.651" offset="2497980">There is a snapshot taken at the date the lawsuit is filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.460" offset="2513236">The rights and the obligations of the parties are fixed at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.601" offset="2529745">Certainly the statute of limitations is fixed at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.459" offset="2541239">If class certification is denied, the statute resumes running.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.614" offset="2553778">Everybody stands where they were at the time the suit was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.221" offset="2568197">That is fair to both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.859" offset="2574780">And at the same time, it fosters the court's and the defendant's interests in repose.</text>

            <text syncTime="650.657" offset="2745934">That statute very specifically refers to the three methods of tolling under Puerto Rico law.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.437" offset="2769131">There is no question that when tolling has properly occurred in Puerto Rico, that the statutory period begins running anew, but the authorities in Puerto Rico law are absolutely crystal clear that the tolling in Puerto Rico must be not only strictly construed by restrictively construed, and I refer to the case of Diaz versus... Diaz de Deana that we have cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.298" offset="2872576">Because the result is a running anew, even the courts of Puerto Rico say that you must restrictively interpret that rule of tolling.</text>

            <text syncTime="704.806" offset="2962542">That is, the federal rule is two rules, a general tolling rule and a precise tolling effect rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.944" offset="2987097">They derive that, as Justice Rehnquist suggested, from the language in the last paragraph of American Pipe, where the Court was saying it remains to determine the precise effect the commencement of the action had on the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.530" offset="3049477">I think in our brief we make clear at least this is our view that that was the Court's recapping, where we stood at the time the lawsuit was filed.</text>

            <text syncTime="834.594" offset="3481751">That is our position entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.013" offset="3495440">And that satisfy's the Rule's Enabling Act as far as we are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.528" offset="3525428">I think it is interesting to look at the reasons why the respondents have looked at this rule of American Pipe as two rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.259" offset="3560432">They have carved up the general tolling part of American Pipe and said, we will take the benefit of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.614" offset="3589794">They have then said, we will go to the Puerto Rico running a new rule, and we will take the benefit of that, and by the way, that gives us a substantive right to one year under Puerto Rico law, and the circularity of this reasoning is fairly amazing, because now that they've had the substantive right derived from American Pipe, they turn around and say American Pipe cannot abridge that right and therefore violates the Rules Enabling Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.011" offset="3683417">They cite a number of cases in their brief that refer to limitations, that allegedly give them a substantive right to one year's worth of tolling, where in fact those cases talk about the limitations of actions being substantive in Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.051" offset="3743603">That indeed is why the tolling statute in Puerto Rico is to be restrictively construed, not merely strictly construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.501" offset="3777353">In any case, as Justice Rehnquist suggests, it is our position that the rule of American Pipe clearly regulates only procedure in the federal courts in class actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.388" offset="3820925">It preserves the status quo as of the filing of the class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.026" offset="3835449">It permits Rule 23 to operate as intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.384" offset="3848929">It is clearly within the Congressional power delegated, and it would pass muster in my judgment if this were an Erie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.680" offset="3878081">It clearly passes muster in a federal action, federal question case.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.192" offset="3896158">And indeed, Tomanio and state law never come into play as far as we are concerned on the rule of American Pipe.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.080" offset="3927714">Now, if we turn to Tomanio, however, I don't think Tomanio applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.562" offset="3961569">The case there is a wholly different case from this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.731" offset="3986228">In Tomanio, there was no compelling federal reason, there was no compelling reason at all for federal tolling.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.992" offset="4015276">The question presented there was, did the pendency of Mary Tomanio's state claims toll the running of the statute as to her constitutional claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.694" offset="4054147">New York law had no rule, had no statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.442" offset="4069089">So the lower courts fashioned the federal tolling rule to preserve her constitutional claims, essentially in furtherance of their view of federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.467" offset="4109213">This Court found the absence of a tolling statute in New York to mean that New York intended no tolling to occur, and that therefore the interests of federalism were better served by following the New York no tolling rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.554" offset="4169608">If that principle were applied to this case, there would be no tolling at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="1654.336" offset="6760746">Thirty-six plaintiffs, who are the respondents here, were found by a Puerto Rico jury to have lost their jobs for political reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.506" offset="6793347">They belonged to the wrong political party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.830" offset="6802646">The issue in the case, as set out earlier, is the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.174" offset="6820096">Does Puerto Rico tolling law, that is, the Puerto Rico tolling law of renewal, govern the denial of class certification for lack of numerosity, or does some other rule when we are talking about Section 1983 federal class actions?</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.107" offset="6887805">Indeed, we are talking about more than Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.493" offset="6897314">We are talking about Section 1981, 1982, 1985, and 1986 as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.022" offset="6919466">There are two considerations that I was hoping to mention at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.945" offset="6935139">The first consideration is that Puerto Rico has a very strong interest in having its tolling rule apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.159" offset="6963978">The Puerto Rico tolling rule of renewal reflects Puerto Rico's judgment as to the proper balance between repose on the one hand and fairness to injured parties on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.264" offset="7012462">There is a related interest in federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.841" offset="7022702">Puerto Rico has a Spanish civil law based system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.388" offset="7040883">Louisiana has a comparable civil law system, but it is based upon the French civil law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.195" offset="7072125">A second threshold consideration is that there was no unfair surprise to the defendants in these cases because they knew about all of these plaintiffs' causes of action.</text>

            <text syncTime="2727.130" offset="11051828">Your Honor, our third argument is relevant if this Court, first of all, rejects our narrow reading of American Pipe, and secondly, it rejects our Section 1988 argument with respect to a void in federal statutory law, which we submit exists, because the American Pipe rule is a judicially created rule of tolling and does not apply, and is not federal statutory law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.149" offset="11187978">If the American Pipe case is a Rule 23 interpretation across the board, and it applies to all federal class actions, including not just 1983 class actions but diversity class actions, then we submit that it would raise several... some very serious problems under the Rules Enabling Act, at least as applied to these Puerto Rico plaintiffs, because the Rules Enabling Act sets out a limitation on Congressional power and this Court's power to promulgate rules of procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="2808.848" offset="11378777">Now, I grant you that is not enough, because whether substantive rights are abridged by a federal rule is a question of federal law, not a question predominantly of state law, but yet this Court has in the past looked to the importance of the particular limitations scheme or the particular rule of the state and asked whether that is substantive.</text>

            <text syncTime="2891.479" offset="11709278">I think this Court suggested in the Holmberg case in the forties that the Rules of Decision Act does not generally apply to federal statutory causes of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.228" offset="11756298">The Puerto Rico Supreme Court has characterized its statutes of limitations as substantive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.350" offset="11780749">Those statutes of limitations and tolling provisions are not designed for procedural fairness as such, but are rather designed to protect states of mind and social utility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.233" offset="11836338">It is therefore our view that at least as applied to these plaintiffs in these cases, the rules... Rule 23, given the very broad interpretation that has been suggested, would violate the Rules Enabling Act, and as such it could not validly be applied to these Puerto Rico plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.244" offset="11912302">Your Honor, if I may say a few more things in connection with some of the observations that were made by the defendants, we did not simply wait for four or five months after class certification was denied to file these individual lawsuits.</text>

            <text syncTime="3012.009" offset="12191394">Particularly in response to the questioning of Justice Stevens and Justice O'Connor, I wish certainly to make clear that while we disagree and have disagreed with the First Circuit's view of Puerto Rico law, our position does not depend on a finding by this Court that the First Circuit misconstrued Puerto Rico law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.115" offset="12263805">Our position is that Rule 23 controls either as an overriding general federal rule of procedure or, if necessary, as the federal choice under Section 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.343" offset="12312707">Finally, it must be kept in mind that, as we have suggested to the Court, that there is a purpose to be served by the rule of American Pipe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.932" offset="12351054">Its purpose is to promote judicial efficiency and economy by providing not only that the running of the statutes of limitations be tolled, but that the tolling end as soon as it has served its purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.318" offset="12408628">As this Court said in American Pipe, this rule of suspension is the</text>
