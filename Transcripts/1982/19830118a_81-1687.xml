            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="154888">Before we hear the arguments in Sony Corporation against Universal City Studios, in case counsel were not in the courtroom at 10:00 o'clock this morning, I'm authorized to announce that Mr. Justice Brennan is unavoidably absent, attending the funeral of a member of his family, and he will participate in these cases on the basis of the papers and the recording, the tape recording of the oral arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.354" offset="292292">[Laughter]</text>
            <text syncTime="41.493" offset="320818">Mr. Dunlavey, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="dean_c_dunlavey" startTime="48.914" stopTime="506.606">
            <label>Mr. Dean C. Dunlavey</label>
            <text syncTime="48.914" offset="350493">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="53.135" offset="367420">The first issue presented by this case is whether a person who receives a free off the air television broadcast in his home by use of a video tape recorder, as distinguished from a television set, is thereby committing direct copyright infringement on the program that he is receiving.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.333" offset="464178">Now, in this case no remedy is sought against any so called direct infringer, but the Ninth Circuit has answered the question yes, and if the Ninth Circuit is upheld then there are some five million plus video tape recorder owners who will be at the mercy of any copyright owner who seeks to take advantage of the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.067" offset="571071">The second issue before the Court is whether there has been contributory copyright infringement by the Petitioners in this case, and bear in mind that they are the manufacturer, the American distributor, and the American national advertiser of a video tape recorder whose brand name is Betamax.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.635" offset="677337">Again, the Ninth Circuit has answered that question yes, and Universal has moved immediately to exploit the situation by filing a second action in the Ninth Circuit against some 50 additional VTR suppliers, and also has filed a second suit against the same Petitioners in this action alleging that, on information and belief, one or more video tape... one or more Betamax owners has copied every single production that Universal has put on television since genesis and must account for that in statutory damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.574" offset="821115">Now, the pernicious point in the contributory infringement aspect is that Universal is seeking either an injunction... and they are dead serious about it... an injunction against the video tape recorder and/or statutory damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.185" offset="887570">And when we talk statutory damages, it's $250 for every owner for every program, and that's the financial liability that they seek to assess upon the Petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.160" offset="939502">So it only takes common sense to realize that the ultimate issue before the Court in this case is whether under the current law all Americans are going to be denied the benefit of time shift home television viewing because a few program owners object.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.191" offset="1027587">If there is to be time shift viewing, and by that I mean a viewing of a program at some time not too long after the broadcast, then manifestly there has to be a record of that program to exist between the time of the broadcast and the time of the viewing.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.904" offset="1102401">In this case that something is a video tape.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.872" offset="1118284">It, by definition of Congress at least, is a copy, and thereby comes the rub, because the copyright law says that only the copyright owner has the right to make a copy of his copyrighted work, unless of course he gives consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.351" offset="1192263">So the direct infringement question here is whether that copy that exists in the form of the videotape between the broadcast and the playback is an infringing copy or is it an example of fair use.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.229" offset="1263734">There is no problem with the playback.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.344" offset="1276168">The playback is authorized specifically by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.944" offset="1286617">The problem lies with the copy.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.248" offset="1299783">The case has been presented by the Respondents through four individual owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.921" offset="1334473">Now, three of those owners really are atypical if you want to look at it from the standpoint of the American public.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.407" offset="1364462">One of them had 100 tapes, one of them had 170 tapes, one of them had 340 tapes... all this at a time when the norm was 30 tapes.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.382" offset="1404377">Amongst those four, however, there is a commonality that gives the issue to the Court this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.419" offset="1436560">Whatever else they did, they copied 32 programs that belonged either to Universal or to Disney.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.177" offset="1475535">Nothing else; the issues to this case reside solely within those 32 copies.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.330" offset="1500194">Each of these persons made his copy at home.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.699" offset="1517644">There is no commercial aspect of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.434" offset="1528615">It never got out of his house.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.436" offset="1532586">It was only intended for his use and perhaps his friends in a couple of instances, and the usage was singularly of the kind we call time shift.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.244" offset="1579815">As the opinion states, it's the recording, the holding for a short period of time, then watching and then erasing, and the erasing is automatic as you record something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.884" offset="1634359">Because of the trial judge's wishes, there are surveys in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.038" offset="1659019">They have to do with the use of the Betamax generally by the persons who were surveyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.811" offset="1686081">But it must be borne in mind that none of those surveys has anything to do with the particular works which have been infringed allegedly.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.867" offset="1730281">None of those surveys pertains to Respondents' work at all, neither those in issue nor of any other kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.606" offset="1761210">And again specifically, none of those surveys shows any librarying of Respondents' work.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.296" offset="1792034">Now, librarying is the other kind of home use that creeps into the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.283" offset="1815962">If a person keeps his tape for a prolonged period of time... and that's never been defined... and looks at it for a number of times... and the number has never been defined... then at least theoretically there becomes a time when he becomes saturated with that program.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.577" offset="1889105">But if that happens, it's outside of this case, because it is not a factor as to any of the 32 works that are in issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.183" offset="1927557">The trial judge's only comments, a summarization of his comments with respect to librarying, was simply that it has not been proven that many persons will library to any significant extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.892" offset="1994431">The trial judge also ruled out certain additional uses that can be made of these tapes if the owner is so inclined.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.998" offset="2026823">You can duplicate them, theoretically.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.916" offset="2034450">That is, once you've got one tape you can make a copy from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.702" offset="2053677">Or you can record from pay television.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.189" offset="2067574">Or, having made your copy, you can take it outside the home for one purpose or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.641" offset="2085441">Or you can swap.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.260" offset="2095890">All of those things are theoretically possible, but there is no evidence in this case that any of that was done with respect to any of the Respondents' works.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.667" offset="2141552">So the trial judge specifically said, there are problems inherent in modern technology that are not in this case and that this case does not purport to resolve.</text>

            <text syncTime="561.058" offset="2399120">The surveys... if you get outside the evidence, and I don't want to do that because my emphasis is to stay within the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.914" offset="2434542">If you get outside the evidence, librarying is on the decrease because these prerecorded copies are being made available, which are better and they serve the purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.972" offset="2482712">Librarying also is something that the owner first thinks of when he buys his machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.959" offset="2506640">Here he's got a device for built in home entertainment.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.260" offset="2519910">But as a matter of fact it turns out to be very expensive, and even one or two of our owners in issue bought with the intent of librarying and then said specifically that they didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.849" offset="2562228">So could it take place?</text>
            <text syncTime="603.385" offset="2568393">Yes, but in fact it's decreasing.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.737" offset="2581768">Now, looking at the Betamax... and realize there's only one public television game going on in this country, everybody has to abide by the same rules, so in trying to find out what kind of a machine is being sold, the District Court looked at evidence of a number of kinds of uses of this machine, which where clearly not infringement, or the owners of the copyright who might have otherwise said it was infringement instead said they consented to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.760" offset="2721889">Many program owners, in addition to the public in general, are in favor of Betamax, because many program owners would rather be seen as a second choice sometime later than to be missed entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.418" offset="2772462">The trial judge said that this was a staple item of commerce, that it was suitable for a variety of non infringing uses, and in that finding, he had all kinds of backed up evidence, because we had specific owners of various kinds of programs, who said that they did not object to or consented to the recording.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.783" offset="2865980">Without wasting time on the details, they included sports program copyright owners, religious owners, childrens' programming owners, entertainment programming owners, and as an aside, the American Broadcasting Company right now is on the verge of broadcasting programs at night, or early in the morning, really, from 2 a.m. to 6 a.m., intended for reception with a VTR so somebody can watch them later on during waking hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.636" offset="2981337">And there were also educational programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.171" offset="2991472">And although Universal prevailed upon the court to find that there was no legitimate use for the Betamax... on the Ninth Circuit Court... Universal itself is a signatory to an agreement called Guidelines, which is a type of agreement between copyright owners and educators.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.536" offset="3088961">It has been given the dignity in the House Committee report and sanctioned by the Senate Committee, the Conference Committee report that followed it, that what they could agree upon would be deemed a fair use.</text>

            <text syncTime="826.379" offset="3460318">What the Ninth Circuit missed was that there are a lot of copyright owners, far more than those who object in fact, who consent to copying.</text>

            <text syncTime="921.358" offset="3840243">It was Justice Holmes in the Kalem case, and he was confronted with a motion picture which had been made without authority of a copyrighted book called "Ben Hur".</text>
            <text syncTime="933.398" offset="3888413">And nobody even questioned that the makers of the camera and the film were infringers, but there was a question as to whether the person who had made the film was a contributory infringer when the person he gave it to exhibited it... exhibited it.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.360" offset="3960302">And Justice Holmes made a very terse but pointed comment that there are a lot of things in society that when you sell them they might be useable for a wrongful purpose, and you set your mind to inquiring when the man makes and sells that product, does he really have cause to know that it's going to be used for a wrongful purpose?</text>

            <text syncTime="995.722" offset="4137726">By the same token, if you're selling something that's a staple item of commerce... and by definition that is something that has got legitimate uses... then you as a manufacturer cannot have the buyer's motive imputed to you.</text>

            <text syncTime="2195.614" offset="8937255">Because if you analogize to the patent statute, which we strenuously resist here, the patent statute requires that not only must the product be a so called staple article of commerce, but it must be suitable for substantial non infringing uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.441" offset="8996606">And the cases have put a gloss on that requirement and said that that may not just be a theoretical non infringing use, but these substantial non infringing uses must also be actual non infringing uses, actual uses found of the product.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.099" offset="9047283">The district court very pointedly did not find that Betamax is suitable for substantial non infringing use.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.670" offset="9073510">And I think if you'll at Petitioner's appendix at page 97, you will see that the district court said that it was going to be applying its staple article of commerce rationale whether or not there was a substantial amount of non infringing use of this machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.845" offset="9130248">And at page 116, I believe it is, of Petitioners' appendix, he said, whatever the percentage of legal versus nonlegal recording may be, he would still apply his standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="2518.753" offset="10229899">And when they get done making their copies, they end up with millions of copies of Respondents' copyrighted works.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.924" offset="10254558">It just makes no difference that the millions of copies end up in their hands because they make them individually, without seeing or hearing each other, rather than buying them from a film pirate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2535.562" offset="10297086">And the 1976 copyright statute under which we're now operating was specifically designed to protect copyright owners from mass copying activities in all contexts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2598.622" offset="10549324">I believe, Your Honor, that has several effects, both under existing markets and as yet untapped but emerging markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.476" offset="10580775">First, many of the motion pictures that are shown on television are also available for sale or rental on video cassettes or video discs which are licensed by the copyright owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.750" offset="10617869">They're available for rental, which means generally a person would just want to see it once and then return it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.885" offset="10638349">The time shift recording, which I think is what you're referring to, would serve exactly the same purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.872" offset="10662277">ABC, referred to by Mr. Dunlavey, is now exploring the use of technology that would permit the copyright owner to license home owners the right to record copyrighted works off the air for a fee, which of course is a right within the exclusive control of the copyright owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.120" offset="10739286">That's a market that doesn't exist yet, but with Sony's cooperation modifying its circuitry so that you couldn't record off a scrambled signal, for example, off the air without permission, that's a market that could be available to copyright owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.112" offset="10795293">So the time shifting type of recording that exists now would destroy that kind of market, because people don't have to pay for it now; they certainly aren't going to want to pay for it in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.901" offset="10834477">There's an additional area, Your Honor, that we haven't really touched on in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.489" offset="10856837">When a television series or a motion picture goes off network and goes to the local stations around the country in the syndication market, it's typically licensed for six runs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.711" offset="10901664">I don't think there could be much dispute that a syndicated station will not want to take six runs in a license if it knows that people have already been seeing this product many times before it reaches the local station.</text>

            <text syncTime="3481.574" offset="14081184">And what's being interfered with here is the opportunity to ever get to that point because now people are doing it for no fee.</text>

            <text syncTime="3493.132" offset="14127368">With respect to this argument that there is consent by certain people to record off the air, Mr. Justice White alluded to the fact that a motion picture doesn't just spring out of the air.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.590" offset="14173239">It's based on a lot of underlying material: the music, which is copyrighted; written work, such as books and plays, which are copyrighted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.862" offset="14202287">And unless you... and they're all separately copyrighted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.397" offset="14216393">And unless the Petitioner or the copier has the permission of the owners of all of the works that are embodied in that motion picture, there is no valid consent to the recording of that material.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.222" offset="14263727">But even if there were consent to some material, I think it's very important to emphasize, as the Ninth Circuit did, that just because some copyright owners don't choose to enforce their rights doesn't mean that other copyright owners who choose to enforce theirs cannot do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.798" offset="14322032">And when you look at how much is supposedly consented to, you find out it's almost nothing compared to what isn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.301" offset="14348050">Petitioners' own survey showed that less than nine percent of all recordings consist of sports, religious and educational programming, and that's all sports, religious and educational programming, not just the programming owned by the few witnesses that were brought to the trial by the Petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.411" offset="14412521">In contrast, over 80 percent of all the recordings are of entertainment programming, which was defined in Petitioners' own survey to mean motion pictures, television series and game shows.</text>

            <text syncTime="3586.243" offset="14499770">Because if you watched the Redskins game on Saturday and you heard the little announcement, it said that there could be no use made of that broadcast without the permission of the Washington Redskins and the National Football League.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.199" offset="14543655">Only the National Football League's Office of the Commissioner gave any testimony on this issue, and the records show that they didn't discuss this issue with any of the individual teams, for example the Washington Redskins.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.007" offset="14586914">So there's not enough consent to allow even that kind of copying in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.642" offset="14609379">I think we should leave the staple article of commerce and the contributory infringement issue with this thought: I think that Petitioners conceded in their brief, and I believe it very clearly to be the law, that if there's knowing contribution to the direct infringement involved here, you don't ever have to reach the staple article of commerce argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.603" offset="14677298">That was an approach that was approved by this Court in the Kalem Brothers case.</text>
