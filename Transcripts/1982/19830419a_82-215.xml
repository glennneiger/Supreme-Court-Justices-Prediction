            <text syncTime="62.708" offset="397326">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this bankruptcy tax collection case comes here on writ of certiorari to the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.796" offset="437659">It presents an important question under the new Bankruptcy Code, whether a Bankruptcy Court in a reorganization proceeding under Chapter 11 may compel the government under Section 542(a) of the Bankruptcy Code to turn over to the debtor in possession property which the government had seized by levy to satisfy the debtor's delinquent federal tax liabilities prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.613" offset="560957">The facts are relatively simple, and can be summarized as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.907" offset="578093">Respondent is a corporation engaged in the business of servicing swimming pools.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.903" offset="606096">In 1979 and 1980, it had unpaid assessments for withholding, employee withholding and social security taxes amounting to some $92,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.289" offset="663670">These liabilities had gone unpaid for almost as much as two years, and on January 14th, 1981, the Internal Revenue Service exercised its statutory rights to levy on Respondent's inventory equipment and other tangible property.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.123" offset="746948">This was done by placing a padlock on the premises, and the property therefore was seized pursuant to Section 6331(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.604" offset="800865">The very next day, January 15th, 1981, Respondent filed a petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="175.147" offset="847050">What was the value of the property seized when the adjustment, $20,000 adjustment was made?</text>

          <turn speaker="stuart_a_smith" startTime="181.831" stopTime="190.967">
            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="181.831" offset="873799">Well, the value of the property was found by the Bankruptcy Court to have a liquidating value of $35,000.</text>

          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="190.967" stopTime="193.966">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="190.967" offset="910370">What was the amount of the government's claim?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stuart_a_smith" startTime="193.966" stopTime="340.339">
            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="193.966" offset="922387">The amount of the government's claim is $92,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.966" offset="938374">The $20,000 adjustment, Mr. Chief Justice, is somewhat of a... well, it is really not before the Court, because it involves the adequate protection question, but let me simply say in passing that the government took the position, correctly, we think, below, that that $20,000 did not constitute adequate protection because that was $20,000 in the bank account that the government had exercised its seizure rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.905" offset="1062090">So what was being done essentially was saying... was the Bankruptcy Court saying, well, you have adequate protection here because I am going to take this $20,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.821" offset="1101796">You have got $20,000 already.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.683" offset="1105244">That was with respect to another seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.277" offset="1115588">But in any event, it is not before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.709" offset="1129381">By doing this, by filing this petition, the Respondent became a debtor in possession, and one month later, in February, the Internal Revenue Service sought to exercise its statutory rights under Section 6335 of the Code to sell the seized property and to reduce it to cash and to apply it against the tax liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.026" offset="1218615">It then, because of that, because it wished to do that, it went into bankruptcy... it went into the Bankruptcy Court on February 18th and sought an order from the bankruptcy judge that the automatic stay provisions of Section 362 did not bar its sale of the property, principally because the property was seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.172" offset="1315164">It was not part of the bankruptcy estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.454" offset="1324359">Respondent counterclaimed and sought an order which is at issue here, the propriety of which is at issue here, requiring the government to turn over the seized property under Section 542(a) of the Bankruptcy Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.711" offset="1385381">The Bankruptcy Court upheld the government on the issue that is before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.867" offset="1405966">It held that Respondent was not entitled to compel a turnover order... to a turnover order under 542(a), and the District Court on review likewise upheld the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.597" offset="1452881">It basically held, in accordance with our submission here, that the seized property was not property of the estate within the meaning of the pertinent provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, and was hence not subject to turnover.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="340.339" offset="1507843">Do you think the District Court or the Bankruptcy Court based that view on the... analogizing the government's position here to that of any seizing secured creditor, or on the basis of peculiar to the government's position?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stuart_a_smith" startTime="355.129" stopTime="417.655">
            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="355.129" offset="1566984">I think on the basis of peculiar to the government's position, that the government is not simply seizing secured credit, but operates, as the Court... as we point out in our brief, and the Court recognized in Phelps, the government... the government's position as tax collector is really quite different and distinct, and Congress has so made it different and distinct because of the involuntary nature of the government's creditor relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.856" offset="1685894">In other words, we did not... unlike a bank, we did not enter into a voluntary relationship with Respondent to lend it money, and hope, you know, and take collateral.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.552" offset="1728734">We basically... Here we are in the position where, as the Court of Appeals itself recognized, the Respondent helped itself to the government's money.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.766" offset="1765515">This was... these were with principally employee withholding taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.327" offset="1787771">So the Respondent paid net payrolls, never paid over the money that the... you know, in a timely way that you are supposed to.</text>

            <text syncTime="431.209" offset="1871363">I mean, I think what it does is show that, you know, essentially this was an involuntary... essentially Respondent was borrowing money from the government in an involuntary way.</text>

            <text syncTime="461.730" offset="1993407">Again, I think it would be the same with respect to income taxes, and the Code suggests that, you know, once taxes are delinquent and owing, the full panoply of statutory authority rests in the Commission to take these steps.</text>

            <text syncTime="498.058" offset="2138752">The theory of these reorganizations, of course, is to get the bankrupt back on its or his feet to be able to pay the creditors perhaps in full.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.054" offset="2186713">Is the government not better off if your security is adequate waiting it out with the rest of the creditors and getting more of the tax money?</text>

            <text syncTime="523.954" offset="2242302">I don't think that in hindsight any of us can sit back and say what the government ought to have done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.684" offset="2289218">This was a situation in which these taxes went unpaid for almost two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.042" offset="2310638">I can assure you and the Court on the basis of how the Internal Revenue Service behaves that levies do not occur gladly or with alacrity.</text>

            <text syncTime="562.657" offset="2397156">Well, the concern I have... the concern I have is that probably in almost every case of a bankruptcy reorganization there are taxes owed the government, and if the government is going to take the position on all these cases that it wants its levy and its money out, then probably the reorganization aspects will not be able to proceed in many cases, and so I was curious why--</text>

            <text syncTime="2147.524" offset="8736552">Therefore, it seems logical that Section 542(a) must deal with the item of property itself, not merely with interests of various parties in that item of property.</text>

            <text syncTime="2170.375" offset="8827980">In other words, the government believes that Section 542(a) has no independent remedial function, but merely codifies the power of the court to compel a third party to turn over to the trustee property which the third party is not otherwise legally entitled to retain, even absent the pendency of the bankruptcy proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.427" offset="8924215">Under the Bankruptcy Act, such a turnover power existed as a judicially created adjunct to the Bankruptcy Court's summary jurisdiction, but it was not available for use against a creditor adversely in possession under a claim of right except in reorganizations, as I will subsequently discuss.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.761" offset="9017525">On the other hand, under the Bankruptcy Code, it would appear that the turnover power extends to property adversely held at the time of the filing of the petition.</text>

            <text syncTime="2722.427" offset="11036163">We believe they were carried forward into Section 542(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.241" offset="11051419">The reason for this can be seen from the historical analysis that we have set out in our brief, and which the Court of Appeals followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.517" offset="11092588">There was considerable testimony adduced in the House and also in the Senate where many parties testifying expressed concern that the original custodial provision, turnover from a custodian under the earlier drafts of the Bankruptcy Code did not provide for turnover by a creditor in self-possession of the debtor's assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.444" offset="11196241">Following that testimony, the redrafted House bill, H.R. 6, was introduced which contained Section 542(a) in its present form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.596" offset="11244934">And we believe that this was done for the purpose of incorporating the decisional rule of law that had developed in many cases, not just Reconstruction Finance, but In Re Prudence Bonds, Grand Boulevard Investment, Third Avenue Transit, Colonial Realty, and so on.</text>

            <text syncTime="2827.076" offset="11454854">We believe that by keying Section 542(a) to the sale, use, or lease of property under Section 363, Congress intended to enable a trustee or reorganizing debtor to acquire possession of needed property in which the interest of the estate is not inconsequential, so long as the interests of the party in possession of the property can be judicially determined to be adequately protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.575" offset="11580764">Section 363(e) mandates an adequate protection hearing upon the request of the affected creditor, and in the case of the proposed turnover of cash collateral, Section 363 mandates such a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.025" offset="11642622">In either case, the trustee has the burden of proving the protection offered is adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.959" offset="11666341">Turnover is required under Section 542(a) of property that the trustee can use, sell, or lease... it is a disjunctive that is used... under Section 363.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.283" offset="11723601">Although the government has concentrated its analysis on Subsections (b) and (c), Subsection (f)(5) of Section 363 permits a trustee to sell property either in the ordinary course of business or out of the ordinary course of business free and clear of the interest of any other entity in the property if</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.724" offset="11821404">"such entity could be compelled in a legal or equitable proceeding to accept a money satisfaction of such interest. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.190" offset="11855259">Clearly, this is the case with respect to the interest of the IRS in all of the property that it seized from Whiting, as the government has no interest in the property except to get paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.291" offset="11911683">Therefore, as Whiting could sell the property under Section 363 at (5), it is entitled to turn over under Section 542(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.275" offset="11959644">Conceding that Section 542 might require turnover by a private creditor in possession of assets, the government nonetheless attempts to exclude itself from the application of that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.188" offset="12015232">In essence, the government's argument takes the following pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.829" offset="12033832">There existed pre-Bankruptcy Code prior decisional law governing the effect of pre-bankruptcy tax levies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.107" offset="12066955">Nothing in the Congressional history specifically indicates that Congress intended to change that prior law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.025" offset="12094645">Therefore, Congress did not change the prior law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.837" offset="12105825">The government's syllogism fails, however, of its own accord, because it is based on a false major premise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.833" offset="12141874">According to the government's argument, pre-Bankruptcy Code decisional law held that the government was not required to surrender to the trustee for inclusion in the bankruptcy estate property seized prior to bankruptcy to satisfy delinquent taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.433" offset="12216271">That is the wording in the government's reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.994" offset="12230481">But there is no case cited by the government as prior law under the Bankruptcy Act which held that the government could not be compelled to turn over to a reorganization trustee tangible property seized in a pre-petition tax levy which had not been sold at the time of the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.565" offset="12308744">With the sole exception of the Pittsburgh Penguin Partners case, all of the prior law cases concerned the government's seizure of intangible property and its right to retain that property against a liquidation trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.169" offset="12367154">Pittsburgh Penguin Partners, however, which was a Chapter 11 case, is not even prior law as it was decided by the Third Circuit in 1979, one year after the Bankruptcy Code had been enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.274" offset="12431624">Moreover, the decisions in American Acceptance Corporation versus Glendora and In Re Chantler Baking Company, both cited by them as part of this prior law, were published on March 30, 1977, and July 18, 1977, respectively, several months after the introduction of H.R. 6 on January 4, 1977, which already contained Section 542(a) in its present form.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.509" offset="12556490">Recognizing as it must that all of the prior cases arose in liquidations where the existence of a bona fide adverse claim to the property defeated summary jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and would have done so for a private creditor in adverse possession as well as for the government, the government seeks to extend the ratio decidendi of the liquidation cases to broader application by arguing that the prior cases really held that a tax levy in and of itself effected a transfer of ownership to the government of the property levied upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.288" offset="12723673">But in actuality, the only cases which would be prior law that dealt with that particular subject are only three cited by the government, United States versus Eiland, a Fourth Circuit 1955 case, United States versus Sullivan, a Third Circuit 1964 case, and this Court's decision in Phelps versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.028" offset="12818654">Eiland concerned a prepetition levy on an account receivable which belonged to the bankrupt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.243" offset="12855435">The court analogized the levy to a private creditor's attachment and garnishment, and held that the effect of the federal taxing statutes was to create a statutory attachment and garnishment resulting in a "virtual transfer" to the government of the right to receive payment of the debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.080" offset="12942788">Clearly, the court would have held the same way for a private attaching creditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.561" offset="12960761">United States versus Sullivan concerned a prepetition levy on two insurance companies to obtain the benefits under the policies of a living tax delinquent policyholder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.762" offset="13009557">Although the court on the authority of Eiland states that a validly invoked seizure is</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.132" offset="13039023">"tantamount to a transfer of ownership. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.490" offset="13052503">and those words have been carried on in the subsequent decisions dealing with this issue under the Bankruptcy Code, the court nonetheless goes on in Sullivan to hold just the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.625" offset="13109032">It held that by the mere act of levying, the government was not entitled to have the insurance policies cancelled for their cash values, as the levy did not dress the government with all of the rights of the policyholder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.104" offset="13166919">In so holding, the court stated,</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.541" offset="13176637">"But implicit in the statute, the Internal Revenue Code, is the principle that the Commissioner acts pursuant to the collection process in the capacity of lienor as distinguished from owner. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.845" offset="13233897">"Moreover, nowhere in the code is there a provision granting to the Commissioner power over property interests of delinquents comparable to that given the trustee in bankruptcy. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.093" offset="13282903">The last case that is left is Phelps, and we have already discussed that to some extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.869" offset="13313936">Most significantly, and the only thing I would like to comment on Phelps to the Court at this time, is that it is difficult for me to understand the government's overreliance on Phelps when one considers that the holding most likely would have been the same, in favor of a secured creditor who had taken steps to recover the funds at issue from the assignee for benefit of creditors had the funds been the proceeds of the sale of assets, subject to the creditor's security interest, rather than proceeds of the sale of assets subject to the government's unfiled tax lien.</text>

            <text syncTime="3339.896" offset="13506093">And the rationale in Phelps is identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.771" offset="13521557">Although the language may appear somewhat overbroad taken out of context, in context, it makes absolute good sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.955" offset="13550292">All in all, then, it is our opinion that prior decisional law did not establish a rule that property seized by prepetitioned tax levy was never subject to post-bankruptcy turnover.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.060" offset="13602746">Rather, the cases simply held that the government did not have to turn over seized assets in circumstances where a private creditor exercising equivalent lien rights would not have had to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.695" offset="13653319">The true intent of Congress with respect to the treatment of the Internal Revenue Service as a creditor under the Bankruptcy Code can best be seen by the provisions of Section 106(c)(1), which in waiving the government's sovereign immunity makes it clear that any provision of the Code applicable to an entity such as Section 542(a), which specifically applies to entities, applies to "governmental units".</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.541" offset="13780692">As the IRS is by far the federal governmental unit most frequently involved in bankruptcy cases, it is clear that Congress intended the IRS to be included in Section 542(a) turnovers, not excluded, as the government here suggests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.876" offset="13858014">In conclusion, we would respectfully submit that a statute should be construed so as to achieve its purpose, that a reform act, such as the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, should be permitted wherever possible to simplify and modernize the law of bankruptcy in conformity with the developing law in the field, and that effect should be given to the avowed intent of the legislative sponsors to enact legislation that</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.146" offset="13983089">"encourages business reorganizations by a streamlined new commercial reorganization chapter that will protect the investing public, protect jobs, and help save troubled businesses. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.812" offset="14041708">We believe that the position taken by the government in this case is regressive and in conflict with the intent of Congress in enacting the Bankruptcy Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.838" offset="14081832">We respectfully submit that a decision in this case in favor of the government will thwart the independent functioning of the bankruptcy system in reorganization cases by constituting the IRS a censor of prospective Chapter 11 cases in which it might be involved as a creditor, with the power to virtually veto reorganization by seizing assets before petitions can be filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.577" offset="14188829">It will encourage the IRS to seize first and negotiate later.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.795" offset="14209727">Bankruptcy Courts will be powerless to preserve the assets of debtors under their jurisdiction against forced liquidation even if the value of the assets at fair market exceeds the tax debt many times over.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.130" offset="14271063">Such a result, we believe, could not have been intended by Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="3547.922" offset="14338145">I think that the scheme of the law that Respondent has described and the Court of Appeals has held was simply not enacted by Congress when it codified the Bankruptcy Code in 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.243" offset="14407422">Our critical point here is that this property was not property of the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.284" offset="14439605">Section 541, the precise words that Congress used, talked about all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.046" offset="14490700">The legislative history is absolutely clear that the sponsors determine that this provision was not to expand the debtor's rights in property as of the commencement of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.553" offset="14548692">The question before the Court is, what were the debtor's rights in this property as of the commencement of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.646" offset="14577113">To that... property rights are not defined under the Bankruptcy Code, but are defined either under state law or in this case under the Internal Revenue Code, and to that, I submit, the Court must refer to Section 6331(a), et cetera, the levy provisions, and it is absolutely clear that under those situations the debtor... under that situation the debtor had very limited rights under this to this property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.682" offset="14693201">He could receive notice of seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.134" offset="14703023">He could receive surplus property, et cetera, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.461" offset="14716294">He could not use, sell, or lease this property within the meaning of Section 363(b) of the Bankruptcy Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.958" offset="14750357">There... his right, simply, to get the property back, he had to pay the tax, and if he didn't do that, the IRS, without any further ado, without resort to any judicial proceeding, could sell the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.514" offset="14812529">The fact that this may thwart the rehabilitation of the debtor is a sorry circumstance in this case, but it proceeds on the basis of the explicit statutory words enacted by Congress in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.927" offset="14878253">What the Court of Appeals has done here is to prescribe a rule that was neither enacted by Congress with respect to secured creditors but at all events hardly enacted with respect to the Internal Revenue Service's statutory collection authority.</text>
