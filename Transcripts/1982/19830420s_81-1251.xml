            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="92289">The second case is a Connick against Myers which is here from the Fifth Circuit Court of -- Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.558" offset="134503">The petitioner, Myers is an Assistant -- was an Assistant District Attorney in New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.868" offset="175672">And one day -- one day she circulated a -- a questionnaire in the office among her -- to her colleagues asking what they thought about the office's transfer policy, asking how office morale was and their opinion, and asking whether -- what degree of confidence they had in their superiors.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.255" offset="277236">And also, whether they felt that they were under some pressure to perform political duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.424" offset="309941">When petitioner, Connick, the District Attorney heard about this, he thought it was an act of insubordination and discharged Myers.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.379" offset="353722">She then filed suit, claiming that her discharge violated her First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.595" offset="378591">The District Court and the Court of Appeals agreed with her and ordered to -- her reinstatement with backpay.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.246" offset="401265">We granted certiorari and we reverse that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.068" offset="412550">In our view, Myers' First Amendment rights were not violated and our reasons for thinking so were stated in an opinion which we have filed with the clerk.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.632" offset="466780">Justice Brennan joined by Justices Marshall, Blackmun and Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
