            <text syncTime="79.012" offset="466208">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the issue presented here concerns the constitutionality of police conduct undertaken to investigate suspicion of illegal activity as it arises in a public place.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.898" offset="533813">Specifically, when circumstances arise that give police a reasonable suspicion that an individual is carrying contraband in his suitcase, is it reasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment for the police to detain that suitcase for a limited time in order to conduct a specific limited course of investigation to confirm or dispel their suspicion, in this case, to arrange for a sniff by a narcotics-detecting dog?</text>
            <text syncTime="122.729" offset="641124">The Court of Appeals held, and Respondent argues--</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="126.009" offset="654185">Mr. Horowitz, are you contesting basically the issue relating to the seizure and detention of the luggage as opposed to the subsequent exposure to the dog sniff?</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="145.907" offset="733807">So all we are dealing with is the seizure and detention.</text>

          <turn speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="148.407" stopTime="387.280">
            <label>Mr. Alan I. Horowitz</label>
            <text syncTime="148.407" offset="743838">--Yes, the 90-minute period of time during which the Respondent was dispossessed of his luggage.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.372" offset="763691">The Court of Appeals held, and Respondent argues, that such conduct is unreasonable unless the police have probable cause to believe that the suitcase contains contraband, the same standard that would justify arresting the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.931" offset="817921">The facts underlying this case can be summarized as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.945" offset="837983">Two Florida narcotics detectives on duty at Miami Airport observed respondent behaving in a manner characterized by the District Court as "odd, if not bizarre".</text>
            <text syncTime="181.691" offset="876958">To the trained eyes of the agents, this behavior seemed designed to detect surveillance, and created a suspicion in their minds that Respondent was a drug courier.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.622" offset="916664">The officers also noted that Respondent had purchased his ticket with cash, and that there were certain discrepancies in the information on his baggage tags.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.088" offset="950518">They approached Respondent in the boarding area, and had a brief conversation with him, but they terminated that conversation to allow Respondent to catch his flight to New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.725" offset="993046">The Florida detectives, however, called ahead and communicated all of the information they have obtained to DEA Agent Gerard Whitmore, who was stationed at LaGuardia Airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.535" offset="1036304">Agent Whitmore and his partner watched Respondent as he alighted from the flight in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.859" offset="1061591">They also observed him engaged in a series of maneuvers that appeared to them to be designed to detect and evade surveillance, and that indicated to these officers as well that Respondent likely was a drug courier.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.009" offset="1114254">After Respondent retrieved his bags from the baggage claim, the agents approached him, identified themselves, and informed him that he was suspected of carrying narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.740" offset="1157095">Respondent immediately stated that he had recognized the agents as policemen, a remark he had also made to the officers in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.080" offset="1186456">When asked whether the bags he was carrying were his, Respondent said that they were, and then he falsely stated that he had already been surrounded by a gang of agents in Miami who searched both his person and his bags.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.607" offset="1240582">Respondent subsequently refused a request by the officers to consent to a search of his bags, and then asked them whether he was under arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.010" offset="1274228">Agent Whitmore informed him that he was free to leave, but that his luggage would be kept and taken to a judge to determine whether there was probable cause for the issuance of a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.863" offset="1317591">The agents explained to Respondent that they would not open the luggage without a warrant, and that they would return it to him if no warrant was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.204" offset="1351028">Some further conversation ensued, in which Respondent retracted his earlier admission of ownership of one of the bags, and asked the officers whether some arrangement could be made or whether something could be fixed up so that he could still leave the airport with his bags.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.121" offset="1414662">Ultimately, Respondent stated that he had pressing engagements and did not wish to remain with his luggage, and the agents gave him a number for him to contact them to arrange for the return of his luggage.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.664" offset="1460847">The agents then took the luggage to the Customs mail handling facility at Kennedy Airport to arrange for exposure to a drug-detecting dog.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.816" offset="1497418">Approximately 90 minutes after the luggage was taken from Respondent, the dog reacted positively to one suitcase.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.016" offset="1526257">After a search warrant was obtained, the suitcase was opened, and substantial quantities of cocaine, marijuana, and LSD were found.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.872" offset="1557709">The District Court denied a motion to suppress, finding that Agent Whitmore had reasonable suspicion that Respondent's suitcase contained contraband, and that this suspicion justified the temporary detention of the luggage to arrange for the dog sniff.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.710" offset="1617059">A divided Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.303" offset="1627403">The majority accepted the District Court's finding of reasonable suspicion, but held that the detention of a suitcase based on such suspicion could last no longer than could a temporary detention of a person, and hence the 90-minute detention here was unconstitutional in the absence of probable cause.</text>

            <text syncTime="972.337" offset="4039550">That justification, of course, is not present with the seizure and detention of luggage.</text>

            <label>Mr. Alan I. Horowitz</label>
            <text syncTime="978.912" offset="4065777">I don't think that's really the justification for the investigative stop in cases like Terry, Brignoni-Ponce, and Michigan against Summers.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.780" offset="4101304">That was the justification for the frisk in Terry, for the search, but of course the officer in Terry was not in any danger until he actually approached the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.905" offset="4137771">He could have turned around and walked around the block.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.542" offset="4148324">What was the justification for the approach in these cases, and is, I think, well set forth by the Court in Adams against Williams, is that an officer, when he has a strong suspicion that a crime was about to be committed, is not supposed to just turn his back and walk away and sit idly by while it happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.490" offset="4212167">Michigan against Summers and Dunaway against New York, however, state that there are time limits on the detention of a person that can be based on reasonable suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.593" offset="4272562">At some point, when that temporary detention becomes close to the intrusiveness of an arrest, it must be justified by probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.664" offset="4312791">Now, the real issue in this case is whether the Court of Appeals is correct in saying that the exact same standard that applies to when a temporary detention of a person becomes overextended, does that also apply to the temporary detention of effects, even though the intrusion onto a person's liberty is obviously much less?</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.706" offset="4397010">We submit that there cannot be this equality, and that it must be that a detention of effects can be extended for a longer period of time, for example, the 90 minutes involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.764" offset="4445284">The Court has on many occasions stated the basis on which the reasonableness of a police action is to be determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.662" offset="4488856">It is judged by balancing the intrusion on the individual's Fourth Amendment interests against its promotion of legitimate government concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.082" offset="4522502">Now, in making that balancing here, I think the strong government concerns involved are clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.925" offset="4541833">The government has a vital interest in alleviating the narcotics problem in this country, and in detecting and apprehending drug offenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.969" offset="4574015">When officers reasonably suspect an individual of transporting narcotics through an airport, they obviously have a strong interest in preventing him from escaping and placing those drugs irretrievably into the chain of distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.120" offset="4626678">That interest is much stronger in a case like this one, where they know that if they can preserve the status quo for a short time, they can either confirm that suspicion or it will be dispelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.145" offset="4674744">Thus, under the rule established by the Court of Appeals, the officers in this case were placed in the position of allowing a person they strongly suspected of carrying drugs to escape from right under their noses, while they are left with the knowledge that if they had just had a little bit more time to investigate, they could have developed probable cause, arrested him, and seized the drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.763" offset="4765232">Now, weighed against this strong government interest is what we feel is a fairly limited intrusion caused by the temporary detention involved here, and that is simply the dispossession of Respondent's luggage for the time required to complete the dog sniff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.488" offset="4828135">At the outset, let me say that it has never been contended that this is no intrusion at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.486" offset="4852167">It is an interference with the Respondent's possessory interest in his suitcase for a limited period of time, and it is a seizure that is covered by the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.732" offset="4889157">What is contended here is that this intrusion is sufficiently small that it is justified by reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, and does not require the strictest standard of probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.197" offset="4934923">Now, to illuminate this point, it is useful examine the detention here in light of the intrusive aspects associated with other police actions that normally require probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.174" offset="4986855">The biggest category of these, of course, is investigative searches, which usually can be conducted only on probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.766" offset="5017261">Those, of course, involve an invasion of privacy, which the Court has many times recognized as the core of the Fourth Amendment protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.030" offset="5050280">In this case, there was no search until a warrant based on probable cause was obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.247" offset="5071178">There was no invasion of privacy whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.059" offset="5082463">The principle that the core protection of the Fourth Amendment is privacy finds its expression in many areas of Fourth Amendment law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.224" offset="5123109">For example, in the warrant area, the Court has recognized that the protections of a warrant are much more necessary in the area of searches than they are in seizures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.862" offset="5165637">Warrantless seizures from public places are generally recognized as reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, as are warrantless arrests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.201" offset="5194998">Similarly, in Chadwick, a case where this Court held that the police were not allowed to search a footlocker in that case on the basis of probable cause until they had obtained a warrant, the Court also stated that it was clear that they were entitled to detain that footlocker without a warrant while they were seeking the issuance of the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.350" offset="5283606">And also, in the immigration area, the Court has recognized that roving border patrols are empowered to effect seizures of cars suspected of carrying aliens on the basis of reasonable suspicion, but they are not empowered to search those cars without probable cause.</text>

            <label>Mr. James Dexter Clark</label>
            <text syncTime="1663.962" offset="6806022">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I had not planned to address myself to specific factual issues or discussions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.066" offset="6846460">However, in light of some of the questions from the Court, I would like to speak to the resolution of some of the facts that have been raised by the members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.062" offset="6882404">For example, I think it was pointed out that at Miami, when Mr. Place was initially detained by the public safety officers there, he was detained and certain information was acquired under the so-called Drug Courier Profile.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.744" offset="6949173">What was omitted was the fact that in light of the investigation conducted by these officers, their suspicions were quelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.347" offset="6991596">For example, in the case of Ballard from the Fifth Circuit, where the Drug Courier Profile was conveniently itemized, one of the things that these officers look for is whether or not the ticket is issued in the same name as the identification that is produced by the detainee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.232" offset="7067142">In this particular instance, the name coincided without exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.570" offset="7088458">Also, in the Ballard case it is pointed out that one of the facts that they look for is whether or not the luggage is hand-carried luggage, and whether or not he is only carrying one bag.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="1747.801" offset="7141434">Well, Mr. Clark, you say the suspicions in the case of your client were quelled at Miami.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.598" offset="7160556">Then why did the Miami agents call ahead to LaGuardia?</text>

            <label>Mr. James Dexter Clark</label>
            <text syncTime="1756.283" offset="7175289">The reason they called ahead to LaGuardia was, in the words of Judge Platt, the presiding District Court judge, in his opinion, was why Mr. Place made a mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.200" offset="7222936">As he was leaving to go and board the plane, he turned to the officers and addressed them and said, I knew that you were police, that you were law enforcement authorities all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.569" offset="7272464">Based on that, Detective McGavock, who was the primary investigating officer, became suspicious, and ran down and retrieved information from the name tags on the two suitcases.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="1793.956" offset="7325963">It isn't really accurate, then, to say their suspicions were quelled, because they did call ahead.</text>

            <text syncTime="1797.938" offset="7341950">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.123" offset="7346652">But for that particular comment, the officers did say on the record that their suspicions were quelled, and that is why they did not further detain him, but actually allowed him to plane.</text>

            <text syncTime="1809.933" offset="7389911">Well, I thought they discovered that he had a false address on his luggage tags.</text>

            <text syncTime="1815.509" offset="7412167">That is not correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.369" offset="7419691">I believe a specific reading of the record will determine that the information that was relayed by Detective McGavock to Agent Whitmore in New York made no mention of this supposed disparity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.047" offset="7486355">As a matter of fact, it is pointed out in the record--</text>

            <label>Mr. James Dexter Clark</label>
            <text syncTime="1840.185" offset="7510910">--The disparity existed in the fact that there was a strikeover in the numerical sequence of the numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.323" offset="7543511">The addresses were 1885 South Ocean Boulevard, 1865 South Ocean Boulevard, which apparently had some degree of raising Detective McGavock's suspicions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.521" offset="7600249">That fact was not relayed to Gerry Whitmore in New York.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="1868.097" offset="7622610">But in any event, it didn't satisfy the police in Miami.</text>

          <turn speaker="james_dexter_clark" startTime="1872.251" stopTime="1917.325">
            <label>Mr. James Dexter Clark</label>
            <text syncTime="1872.251" offset="7639224">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.549" offset="7644344">We do not dispute that they called ahead and alerted DEA to Mr. Place's imminent arrival on the airline flight.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.202" offset="7679034">The other thing that I would like to point out is that although the officers had the two suitcases subjected to a dog sniff approximately 90 minutes after the bags were seized, they achieved a result of positive on one bag and nothing on the other bag, and they took no steps during the weekend to contact Mr. Place so he could get back the bag that was not the subject of the search warrant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1917.325" offset="7819469">But I thought he hadn't given them an address or a means whereby they could contact him.</text>

            <label>Mr. James Dexter Clark</label>
            <text syncTime="1922.044" offset="7838381">They had his address.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.560" offset="7844442">They had discovered it through their own investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.808" offset="7857398">They also had his telephone number.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.148" offset="7866802">They also had his credentials as being verified by his driver's license, and his ticket coincided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.756" offset="7905255">It was certainly not incumbent, at least at this point, on Mr. Place to seek out his bags.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.330" offset="7943498">We have already been pointed out that at least 50 percent or more of these cases are not going to turn out to be subjects of investigation, and yet there are no steps, at least known to the government at this point, as to how the DEA plans to get these bags back into people's hands.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="1969.290" offset="8027299">But the return of one bag and the search of the other really wouldn't help your client much in this case, would it?</text>

            <text syncTime="1976.286" offset="8055302">But it just goes to show that the government's position that a detention of bags, and I might add, so far, it has been approaching three years since the bag has been detained, both bags, that is, that such a detention is not one that is involving Fourth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.995" offset="8158120">They seem to say that personalty, items of personalty should be adjudged by some lesser standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.804" offset="8185392">And with that, I would like to turn from the discussion of the facts and go to what we feel is the thrust of our legal argument, and it is basically a two-pronged argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.252" offset="8239204">First, we ask that this Court not expand the so-called Terry exception to the probable cause warrant requirement, and second--</text>

            <text syncTime="2198.182" offset="8942943">I would like to address that particular issue that as to police conduct, I thin we have some insight into how law enforcement authorities are going to act in situations where a person is, as Justice O'Connor suggested, going to have to go into their briefcase to retrieve their automobile keys.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.453" offset="9031968">It is in the record in this case that in Miami, Detective McGavock, while watching Mr. Place open a hand-held bag that he had with him, positioned himself so that he could view the contents of that bag.</text>

            <text syncTime="2605.688" offset="10572879">Another reason that we say that such a detention is more intrusive is that an item of personalty by its very nature, you either have it or you don't.</text>

            <text syncTime="3149.009" offset="12746267">I see implicitly in those decisions the fact that this Court recognizes that there is more to privacy than being protected from a visual inspection.</text>

            <label>Mr. James Dexter Clark</label>
            <text syncTime="3187.634" offset="12900703">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and members of the Court, without being redundant, I do want to just basically pick up where I began by stating that I was pointing out to the Court what I feel to be significant in that it is implicitly present in Arkansas versus Sanders and the Chadwick cases, and that is, I have divided the right to privacy into three elements as opposed to the one which is proposed by the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.324" offset="13015433">It is the government's proposition that privacy includes only protection from visual inspections in these types of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.447" offset="13043958">I would also include among the right of privacy the right of personal security and the right to be free from unwarranted intrusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.007" offset="13078231">In the Chadwick case and in the Sanders case, the items of personalty, the footlocker, baggage that was seized, probable cause was in existence at the time of the seizure, and that, to me, indicates that personal security and freedom from unwarranted intrusions was protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.531" offset="13160255">Obviously, that was not the case in this particular instance, because personal security and the right to be free from intrusion was certainly not afforded to Mr. Place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.024" offset="13210306">I would also like to bring to the Court's attention what I feel is not the status of the law with regard to the reasonableness proposition that is being urged by the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.081" offset="13278538">They would have the Court base all Fourth Amendment search and seizure questions on the test of reasonableness, and I believe that they will rely, as they have indicated in their brief and especially in their reply brief, on Michigan versus Summers, I do not believe that the reading of Michigan versus Summers gives an ad hoc reasonableness test as the standard for measuring Fourth Amendment search and seizure questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.300" offset="13423361">And I look back and take the Michigan versus Summers case, by balancing it against Dunaway, and in writing the Summers case, Mr. Justice Stevens took pains to point out that the seizure in that case was distinguishable from that in Dunaway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.429" offset="13527851">Dunaway goes directly to the point of rejecting the reasonableness test, and in the Summers case, it was pointed out that the distinguishing factors were that a warrant to search the house where Mr. Summers was had previously been issued establishing that there was probable cause to search that particular house.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.154" offset="13642789">Also, it was pointed out that the detention of Mr. Summers in the context and under the circumstances of the factual situation was not the type of detention that would lead to prolonged interrogation, as was the case in Dunaway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.302" offset="13715410">So, I don't believe that Michigan versus Summers stands for the general proposition that reasonableness is a standard by which all Fourth Amendment questions can be tested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.528" offset="13780298">As a matter of fact, to do so, as pointed out in the Dunaway case, would be to put in the hands of law enforcement officers the first instance of determining whether or not reasonableness existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.098" offset="13854590">In closing, I ask and urge this Court to affirm the Second Circuit's decision, and I ask that this Court utilize the issues which are raised by this case to inform us all that Fourth Amendment rights will not be diluted as proposed and put forth by the government in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.245" offset="13975171">Thank you.</text>

            <label>Mr. Alan I. Horowitz</label>
            <text syncTime="3459.992" offset="13990113">A view brief points, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.523" offset="14000249">I think the Court has to consider the implications of Respondent's argument that this detention here can be effected only on the basis of probable cause, keeping in mind Justice Stevens' comment that we are dealing with probabilities here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.408" offset="14055838">On the basis of probable cause, even sometimes probable cause only in the judgment of an officer, and not approved by a magistrate, police are entitled to search a person's effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.793" offset="14105366">They are entitled to search his home.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.322" offset="14111426">They are entitled to arrest him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.057" offset="14118427">They are entitled to imprison him, even though in some of those cases, because of the very nature of the probable cause standard, we know that the suspicion is going to turn out to be wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.006" offset="14158238">Here, the intrusion is so much less that it must be reasonable to allow the intrusion on the lesser standard of reasonable suspicion, even though in some cases this may permit a baggage detention where the person turns out not to have contraband in his suitcase.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.970" offset="14222081">I think to graphically illustrate the sort of reasonable suspicion standard that we are talking about, you might consider a case where the police have reasonable suspicion to believe that some of, say, a group of ten people have contraband in their suitcases, and they know that three or four of them have heroin in their suitcase, but the other six or seven do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.227" offset="14315077">Is it really reasonable for the police to allow all ten of them to walk out of the airport, knowing that they are allowing 40 pounds of heroin to go, or should they be able to detain all ten suitcases for the hour and a half necessary to bring a dog over to sniff them?</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.937" offset="14369934">I would also say that it may be that in some of these cases, there is going to be some slight incremental intrusion that does not occur in the general case just because of the detention, the cases that Justice O'Connor and Justice Stevens were talking about, where perhaps a person has to take some personal effects out of his suitcase that he needs immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.396" offset="14455720">I should say first that this is the typical case, the one we have here, and none of these lower court cases that are cited in the briefs... there have been many cases like this already.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.784" offset="14497307">They all involve luggage, and none of them involve cases where personal effects had to be taken out, but even in those unusual cases, I still think the detention is reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.264" offset="14535237">The additional intrusion of having to show your keys or something like that to the officer is really quite incremental, especially in the airport context, where things like carry-on luggage and purses have been already subjected to a search through an ex-ray machine before you could get on the plane.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.367" offset="14595632">In an unusual case where there is a drastic inconvenience to the person involved in a luggage detention, that might be different, and the Court could consider that case when it comes up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.490" offset="14636174">I would also like to make a couple of factual points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.349" offset="14647563">There was some discussion about why one of the bags wasn't returned over the weekend.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.422" offset="14667834">In fact, the agents applied for a search warrant for both bags, so it was certainly necessary for them to keep them both during that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.594" offset="14692598">As far as why they didn't apply for a warrant before the weekend, we don't necessarily say that that was correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.853" offset="14725617">They probably should have applied for it over the weekend.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.402" offset="14731782">But I don't think that has anything to do with the issue presented in this case, which is just the legality of the detention for the period required to establish probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.661" offset="14772847">It might be, if for some reason the discovery of the evidence was somehow a fruit of the additional detention that took place over the weekend, that that would be a different question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.939" offset="14809940">But it is not presented here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3685.867" offset="14893637">I think the fact that the Court denied the cross-petition in this case certainly suggests to the parties that it wasn't going to consider that issue here.</text>
