            <text syncTime="85.793" offset="481349">The patent expired more than a decade ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.211" offset="490963">The case was filed in 1956 in the Northern District of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.881" offset="513637">Twenty-four years later, and after a number of conflicting decisions on both validity and the patent scope, the District Court of Delaware entered judgment on the accounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.236" offset="575077">It assessed prejudgment interests of about $11 million against General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.375" offset="599632">Interest was charged at the commercial bond rates from the dates the infringement was held to have occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.215" offset="627008">The specific question presented on certiorari here is whether the applicable statute, 35 USC 284, requires the award of prejudgment interest on unliquidated damages based on reasonable royalties, where there is a finding that the defendant acted in good faith and not recklessly.</text>

            <text syncTime="151.469" offset="744037">If the Court please, the first question here is whether it requires it.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.123" offset="766607">We think the court of appeals held that interest was mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.198" offset="790953">Then we go on to the question of whether the Duplate versus Triplex case is still the law, and finally, to the influence of the Georgia Pacific case, which I will mention in a few moments.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.660" offset="844765">The statute provides that in patent cases, the Court shall award damages adequate to compensate for infringement, but no event less than a reasonable royalty, together with interest and costs as fixed by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.248" offset="903175">It is the direct successor to the 1946 Patent Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.231" offset="923028">The Act provided for interest in similar language... the 1946 Act provided for interest in similar language, and it was the first reference to interest in the patent statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.381" offset="983632">The key factor in this case is that the initial form of the 1946 Act explicitly required the award of prejudgment interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.392" offset="1031697">As proposed, the court would be required to award damages which shall be due compensation for infringement, but not less than a reasonable royalty, together with interest from the time the infringement occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.496" offset="1096167">It was in that form that the statute actually passed the House of Representatives, but in the Senate, this language was rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.945" offset="1141934">The Senate struck the reference to interest from the time the infringement occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.939" offset="1165862">In its place, the Senate substituted the expression,</text>

            <text syncTime="264.314" offset="1195433">and it was in this amended form that the Act was passed by both Houses of Congress and signed by the President.</text>

          <turn speaker="george_e_frost" startTime="345.216" stopTime="722.828">
            <label>Mr. George E. Frost</label>
            <text syncTime="345.216" offset="1519038">The law as to interest was this Court's Duplate versus Triplex case, which required exceptional circumstances, meaning bad faith conduct of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.434" offset="1555923">Coming over to attorneys' fees, the provision on attorneys' fees was a new provision in the Act, and the way the Act is set up, it is very clear that that is expressly stated to be discretionary, unlike the case of interests and costs which in each instance there was a settled rule, and the construction of the Act indicates that it was the intent of Congress that that rule be followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.878" offset="1649650">Now, coming to the 1952 Patent Code, it did codify the patent law, and Section 254 of the Code replaced the law on recoveries previously covered by the 1946 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.698" offset="1712971">The language closely follows the 1946 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.367" offset="1727599">The revisor notes on the Code point out that the Code only made some changes in language at that point, and plaintiffs here concede that Section 284 was not intended to change the applicable provisions of the 1946 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.424" offset="1787890">The error of the court below commenced with its misapplication of the dictum of the ruling of this Court in Aro versus Convertible Top, 377 US.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.981" offset="1838045">In that case, four Justices of this Court examined the basis for recoveries for patent infringement under 35 USC 284.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.931" offset="1877856">The issue of concern was whether the profits of the infringer or damages to the patentee are the measure of recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.992" offset="1910143">In explaining the effect of the 1946 Act, they quoted the House report on the bill that became the 1946 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.844" offset="1953506">At the time the House report was made, the bill included the later rejected interest language.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.297" offset="1983390">The portion of the report quoted in the opinion included this then existing language on interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.493" offset="2024141">The inclusion of this language did not relate to any issue being considered by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.273" offset="2047234">There is no issue in the case on prejudgment interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.335" offset="2063534">The courts of appeal for the Sixth, Second, and Seventh Circuits have specifically held that the quotation in the Aro case is not controlling, and that the statute does not compel prejudgment interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.298" offset="2115361">The court below stands alone in holding that the Aro quotation controls and in relying upon it to compel interest in a reasonable royalty case, notwithstanding the history of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.981" offset="2170114">To be sure, the Court added to its reference to Aro by seeking to justify the award of prejudgment interest because the defendant had the use of the royalty money in the time between the dates that infringement was held to take place and the time of judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.003" offset="2254123">But this is true in every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.971" offset="2266035">There is always a span of time between the date of an infringement and the date of a judgment awarding damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.373" offset="2295606">If interest is allowable in this case, for this reason, it is allowable in every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.511" offset="2320161">In short, this reason only adds to the basic error of misapplying the dictum in the Aro case instead of looking to the Act as passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.521" offset="2356210">The judgment should be reversed, because the decision below is based on a mandatory interest requirement that Congress rejected and is clearly contrary to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.503" offset="2408141">Now, the history of the 1946 Act also answers other questions in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.283" offset="2431234">Devex contends that the term 35 USC 284 requires prejudgment interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.201" offset="2466969">But the 1946 Act as it was passed by the House and reached the Senate provided for due compensation, not less than a reasonably royalty, using that very term, and the statute or post statute at that time also used explicitly required interest from the time infringement occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.443" offset="2547949">After the Senate amendments, the reference to due compensation not less than a reasonable royalty remained in the statute, and the words</text>
            <text syncTime="614.219" offset="2595074">"interest as may be fixed by the court. "</text>
            <text syncTime="616.216" offset="2603015">were substituted for</text>
            <text syncTime="618.216" offset="2611061">"interest from the time the infringement occurred. "</text>
            <text syncTime="620.529" offset="2620256">Now, whether we take the time before the amendment or after, the term "due compensation" obviously was not used in a sense of requiring interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.024" offset="2666231">Otherwise, why the explicit reference to interest from the time the infringement occurred before the amendment, and why the reference to the interest as may be fixed by the court after the amendment?</text>
            <text syncTime="650.111" offset="2738643">At no point in the history was due compensation treated as if it required interest, and the same is true of damages adequate to compensate as the term is used in 35 USC 284.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.574" offset="2796425">Now, the history in the text of the 1946 Patent Act also compels the conclusion that the Act codified the pre-existing decisions on prejudgment interest in patent cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.988" offset="2850133">Prior to the 1946 Act, this Court had rendered a number of decisions on prejudgment interest in patent cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.656" offset="2884824">The key decision was Duplate versus Triplex, decided in 1936.</text>

            <text syncTime="1066.780" offset="4405255">And the two respects are, first, the venue question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.454" offset="4419988">The case was filed in the Northern District of Illinois, and there was an early hearing on venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.419" offset="4455828">Devex was fully aware of the facts, and it then sidestepped venue, went through a trial on validity, and then almost ten years later moved to shift the case to Delaware, which motion was successful, was done, but certainly delayed the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.675" offset="4524896">The second thing that occurred here was the patent claim itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.910" offset="4541823">The patent claim was broad and sweeping and invalid as literally construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.312" offset="4567423">This is exactly what Judge Robson held in around 1960, and the court of appeals agreed with that finally, but it did give the claim a narrow and restricted construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.871" offset="4613607">It rewrote the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.261" offset="4623221">The effect of that rewriting of the claim was to make it impossible to know exactly what the claim did cover, with one exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.710" offset="4660941">In their briefs, the plaintiffs wrote... this is in the court of appeals...</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.300" offset="4679332">"If defendants want to avoid infringement, all they need to do is leave out the Borax. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.533" offset="4700334">That is the literal language that was in their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.031" offset="4714231">Now, the delays that occurred in this case had in great measure dealt with the... resolving the questions of what was left of the patent, what it did cover, and the... one of those issues had to do with leaving out the Borax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.228" offset="4783090">What happens if it is something other than Borax?</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.023" offset="4794270">And the court of appeals had validated the patent because of special chemical coaction between the Borax and the other ingredients, so that when the court of appeals decision was made, notwithstanding the broad language of the claim, it just made inevitable the decisions that later followed having to do with the scope of the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.249" offset="4879116">So, we think that in this case, starting out with the conduct of General Motors, it has been found to be in good faith and not reckless, and there is no such finding for the plaintiffs, and when you measure what the plaintiffs did, it had the effect of extending the case far longer than had to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.227" offset="4975038">Now, bear in mind that the language of that patent claim was chosen by the plaintiffs, not by GM, and that the issue here is not whether they might in the end win on various issues, but rather, was it the consequence of something they did that prolonged the duration of this case, and we think clearly it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.387" offset="5063749">Now, I just want to add that with respect to the Duplate rule of this Court, there is plenty of good reasons in favor of the rule as announced by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.695" offset="5120905">Now, the Court did... the Congress did in the Act of course inject itself into the patent... into the patent law, and to that extent it's replaced the Duplate case as such, but we brought it out in their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.921" offset="5193839">There are a number of reasons why the Duplate rule is a very good one, the first one being, it puts the heat on the defendant... plaintiff to keep things moving.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.541" offset="5224350">It makes the defendant follow reasonable, good faith conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.417" offset="5239815">It fits with the public interest in patent cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.335" offset="5259459">And finally, the distinction between liquidated and unliquidated damages is specifically important in patent cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.599" offset="5288507">In this case, it was 1980, and we have a master and a district court that could not agree on either what the patent covered or what the reasonable royalty was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.204" offset="5335005">Unless there is some question, I would like to reserve time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1647.219" offset="6727018">I think there is no question but that what they are talking about there is prejudgment interest, and there is another statute on post-judgment interest, and that post-judgment interest is affixed according to state law, and no one has challenged that particular concept, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.866" offset="6785637">That is really not in issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.539" offset="6792324">So that plaintiff's submission is that "together with interest" at least means that the prejudgment interest as such is mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.173" offset="6842897">Now, considering the fact that the statute as passed is silent as to the time frame and as to when the interest should begin to run, then under those circumstances the intended scope of the interest provision is revealed explicitly in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.977" offset="6926071">The Senate committee expressly adopted the House committee report, which stated,</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.664" offset="6956791">"a reasonable royalty together with interest from the time infringement occurred. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.162" offset="6978838">In addition, the House committee's rationale was also stated, namely, in referring to proceedings before masters that are often protracted for decades, and in many cases result in a complete failure of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.779" offset="7041219">Thus, the statute history reflects the intent of Congress to make interest mandatory from the time infringement occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.182" offset="7074865">This interpretation is not a departure from the language of the statute, but is consistent with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.053" offset="7102345">The House committee report with respect to the 1946 amendment stated,</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.710" offset="7128990">"The object of the bill is to make the basis of recovery in patent infringement suits general damages, that is, any damages that complainant can prove not less than a reasonable royalty together with interest from the time infringement occurred. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.532" offset="7188236">So, as the bill left the House, three things were mandatory in that bill: interest, costs, and attorneys' fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.698" offset="7228987">When the bill... and at that particular time, I think it would be helpful if I read the proposed House bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.602" offset="7260543">It provided</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.866" offset="7265663">"royalty therefore together with his costs and reasonable attorneys' fees to be fixed by the court and interest from the time infringement occurred. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.958" offset="7305996">and that was the shape of the bill as it left the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.063" offset="7322401">The Senate itself adopted the mandatory provisions of the House bill on interest and costs, but amended it to make attorneys' fees discretionary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.247" offset="7367123">As the bill was amended by the Senate, the bill read</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.465" offset="7388021">"royalty therefore together with such costs and interest as may be fixed by the court. "</text>

            <text syncTime="2259.919" offset="9177826">They adopted that view because the statute reads "entire compensation", and this Court has said that in order to make entire compensation under the circumstances, it is necessary to give interest from the time infringement occurred, and in order to do complete justice, as between the plaintiff and the United States government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.365" offset="9267583">Now, we submit the statute here provides for adequate compensation, and it also expressly refers to "together with interest".</text>

            <text syncTime="2436.973" offset="9886058">Arguendo, a second view of Section 284 is that expressed by the Second Circuit in the Georgia Pacific case, in which it was held that the change in the statute in 1946 was intended to grant the trial court its traditional discretionary power in equity.</text>

            <text syncTime="2480.909" offset="10061810">Indeed, the court in Georgia Pacific rejected the argument and the notion that by the 1946 amendment, Congress intended no change whatsoever in the existing law respecting interest, which is the defendant's position here, thus demonstrating that that issue was considered by the Second Circuit and rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.854" offset="10149581">In addition to that, there are some other equitable grounds which support the exercise of discretion by the courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.504" offset="10184167">Number One, GM's entire defense below was founded on the concept that the selection of the inorganic chemicals was to save... costs by General Motors, and therefore the entire reasonable royalty here should be in the area of between $100,000 and $200,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.749" offset="10269118">The special master said, "that this"... The special master held, "that this was contrived".</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.026" offset="10302241">And that finding of fact by the special master was affirmed by the district court, was adopted by the district court and affirmed by the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.441" offset="10347903">The court of appeals affirmed the district court's finding that in addition to the bumper infringement here, that there was infringement on non-bumper parts of 1,300,000,000 parts that had been made by the Hendricks process, and that there was good infringement proved on those one billion parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.745" offset="10445183">Despite that, and despite the requirement of a reasonable royalty, the courts held below that plaintiffs had not established an adequate basis for determining a reasonable royalty on non-bumper parts, despite the fact that plaintiff showed from defendant's own records that there were savings in excess of $60 million on those non-bumper parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.313" offset="10543403">We submit that this is an additional ground for holding that prejudgment interest is proper in this particular situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.873" offset="10577676">In addition, let us show by the mere recital of the facts themselves in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.650" offset="10604739">GM was given notice in 1955 of its infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.993" offset="10622084">The lawsuit was commenced in November of 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.146" offset="10638698">Almost all of GM's bumper infringement thereafter took place after the commencement of this litigation, from 1956 through to March, 1969, when the patent expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.251" offset="10687181">And then, in July of 1963, the Seventh Circuit held that this patent was valid, and this Court denied certiorari in January of '64.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.327" offset="10727410">In November of 1964, 16 years before a decision was entered in the district court, General Motors was offered a license by the plaintiffs at three-quarters of 1 percent of their sales prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.849" offset="10785506">GM refused that offer of a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.943" offset="10801911">After 16 years of litigation, the district court awarded that very same royalty rate of three-quarters of 1 percent as the reasonable royalty here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2709.910" offset="10977767">There was an industry defense against this patent, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.831" offset="10989470">The chemical companies, the suppliers had all joined together with General Motors in making certain that they were going to defend this case to the hilt, and nobody took a license from the plaintiffs, and that in effect, that open infringement by the entire industry even beat down that offer that we made of three-quarters of 1 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.384" offset="11083720">It is this simple history of this litigation which demonstrates why this guilty tort feasor did not take a license, because it was hoping that ultimately it was going to, even if it had to pay a reasonable royalty ultimately, it was going to garner in the interest that it had retained from that reasonable royalty for, indeed, over a 25-year period, GM would have made $11 million of interest on the reasonable royalty if it were permitted to keep that interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.709" offset="11244948">Under those circumstances, the courts below found that it would be against public policy not to award the interest, because it would defeat the amicable licensing of patents and it would tend to prolong the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.860" offset="11293640">Indeed, we have had that right here, that this litigation has been prolonged because of GM's hope that it will not have to pay the prejudgment interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.498" offset="11332197">In addition, there is a very... another very important factor here that supports the judgment below, and that is inflation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.398" offset="11367723">When this lawsuit was begun, in 1956, the inflation factor was 80.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.476" offset="11396040">In 1967, that inflation factor was 100.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.615" offset="11416625">In July of this year, when General Motors paid the $8.8 million, that inflation factor was 291.8.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.565" offset="11452465">Under those circumstances, when you adjust that $8.8 million by the inflation factor, the plaintiffs have been paid in real dollars $3 million.</text>

            <text syncTime="2915.918" offset="11801774">I want to address myself to the fact that General Motors has stated something about delay by the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.040" offset="11842316">The district court made a specific finding in connection with GM's contention to have the costs of the special master taxed equally between the plaintiffs and General Motors.</text>

            <text syncTime="2990.184" offset="12098838">On the.75 percent royalty, the master specifically found that the royalty rate was too high.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.074" offset="12126424">He went into the subject of the conditions at the time of that offer, and he specifically so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.210" offset="12162995">Houdi, the defendant in the Northern District of Illinois whose case was separated, went to soap only immediately after the 1973... '63 Seventh Circuit decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.970" offset="12222032">General Motors discontinued using Borax in its processes, and the only thing left after that time was the so-called TKPP lubricants, which did not use Borax and were within the category of lubricants where General Motors really did leave out the Borax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.160" offset="12322760">We were using the TKPP lubricants in our bumper operations beginning around 1963, and by the time... oh, by '65 it was 100 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.937" offset="12369885">Now, there is another point with respect to this Marvel case that has been mentioned, and it brings out this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.809" offset="12405412">There is a difference between reasonable royalties and established royalties, and the decisions prior to the 1946 Act made it very clear that where you have a situation where the patent is generally licensed at generally uniform rates, so much so that there is an established royalty, that in that case the patentee cannot recover any greater sum than the established royalties, but in that case the damages are in effect liquidated, and therefore prejudged interest should be allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.122" offset="12546682">That is what happened in the Marvel case, and the reference to the change in the statute in that case and the Aro quotation was on an entirely different factual setting for just that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.009" offset="12594225">Reference has been made to the US Code, and as I recall it was the 1946 edition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.569" offset="12628393">In any event, that is not an official compilation of the law at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.676" offset="12648873">If you look at the front part, it very clearly states it was prepared by West Publishing Company and several other contractors, and the committee very carefully states that it is only prima facie law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.905" offset="12697774">Now, lastly, I do want to point out that there has been no reason at all for the Senate to have changed the text of the bill that became the 1946 Act if it was satisfied with mandatory interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.287" offset="12763289">There is no other possible explanation than what the Senate did was to recognize that requirement of interest from the time of infringement as being not what it wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.049" offset="12806339">Unless there is further question, I will conclude.</text>
