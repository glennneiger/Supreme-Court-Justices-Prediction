            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="131614">We will hear arguments first this morning in Guardians Association against the Civil Service Commission of the City of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.189" offset="168290">Mr. Crowley, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="christopher_crowley" startTime="13.141" stopTime="374.709">
            <label>Mr. Christopher Crowley</label>
            <text syncTime="13.141" offset="184172">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.276" offset="200682">I'd like to reserve five minutes for rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.128" offset="208101">Our case presents the question of the proper interpretation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, and more particularly the question of whether Congress meant in 1964 to limit regulatory agencies to the use of a clear intent standard or whether the Congress contemplated the use of an impact approach, at least so far as defining a prima facie case is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.327" offset="304858">Our case was brought by black and Hispanic policemen alleging that entry level examinations for the New York City Police Department discriminated in their effect on blacks and Hispanics and that they were not job-related.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.270" offset="356685">The case has had a long history, but the relevant facts here are that the district court ruled that the examinations did have a discriminatory impact on blacks and Hispanics.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.275" offset="396705">It also held that they were not job-related.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.477" offset="409452">The examinations have both a pass-fail character... one has to Pass them to become a policemen; everyone in our case did pass and did become a policeman... but they are also used as the sole determinant of the order in which people were appointed to the department, which made a great deal of difference in our case because the exams were given in '68 to 1970 and appointments were still being made as late as October 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.176" offset="504225">The relevant findings were that there was a disproportionate... that whites were three times as likely to appear in the top two deciles as were the black applicants.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.167" offset="556261">On the job-relatedness question, the district court stressed the fact that there had been no job analysis to see what it was that the exams were testing for and that therefore the exams couldn't be validated.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.641" offset="606102">It was important to make a finding as to Title VI because some members of the class would not be entitled to relief except under Title VI.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.980" offset="635464">The district court found that we had not shown a showing of intent necessary to make out a 1981 violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.067" offset="667856">As to Title VI, the district court placed considerable reliance on the regulations which, as the court says, were full of language that evidences an intent to disallow practices with a discriminatory impact, and of course the district court placed great reliance on this Court's unanimous 1974 decision in Lau v. Nichols.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.179" offset="736296">The Court of Appeals affirmed as to Title VII and reversed as to Title VI, relying entire on language of opinions in the Bakke case.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.034" offset="767748">Title VI was passed in 1964 as part of the comprehensive Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.022" offset="787601">It provides in Section 601:</text>
            <text syncTime="166.588" offset="797945">"No person shall, on the grounds of race, color or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program with federal sponsorship. "</text>
            <text syncTime="178.330" offset="844861">Section 602 mandates that the federal agencies promulgate affirmative regulations to enforce the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.186" offset="872342">Shortly after the Act was passed, a presidential task force set about drafting model regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.440" offset="901286">Five months later in December, seven federal agencies adopted these comprehensive regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.259" offset="924587">They're the same ones at issue now.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.778" offset="930647">They were the ones at issue in Lau.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.278" offset="936708">Thereafter, a total of some 52 federal agencies have adopted these same impact regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.265" offset="960636">The regulations provide in relevant part here that they prohibit the use of</text>
            <text syncTime="214.205" offset="988430">"criteria or methods of administration which have the effect of subjecting persons to discrimination or which have the effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the program. "</text>
            <text syncTime="225.811" offset="1034824">In our brief we talk about the language of the statute and the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.917" offset="1059274">In my brief time this morning I would like to stress the regulations and their role here.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.635" offset="1082053">The one thing that we suggest that comes across clearly, the only thing that comes across very clearly in the long debate about Title VI, is that there was a very broad authorization by the Congress to the federal regulatory agencies to draft regulations to carry out the mandate of Title VI.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.234" offset="1168466">They're unusual in that they required affirmative approval by the President, but that was really in a sense an index of how important they were, how importantly they were viewed by the Congress at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.142" offset="1216114">There was intense debate about the fact that Title VI did not spell out in more detail just what was meant by discrimination and other violations of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.913" offset="1255193">Senator Ervin says that Title VI leaves it to the agencies to define discrimination</text>
            <text syncTime="285.967" offset="1275464">"without any guideline whatever to point out what is the Congressional intent. "</text>
            <text syncTime="289.836" offset="1290928">The House minority report says:</text>
            <text syncTime="292.788" offset="1302736">"The Administration tends to rely on its own construction of discrimination as including a lack of racial balance. "</text>
            <text syncTime="297.442" offset="1321335">Senator Ervin, when questioning Attorney General Robert Kennedy, says to you:</text>
            <text syncTime="304.779" offset="1350696">"So the rules, which would have the force and effect of law, are to be developed first in the minds of the administrators of various programs, and then written in regulations and orders issued by them? "</text>
            <text syncTime="313.285" offset="1384656">Attorney General Kennedy: "That is correct, Senator".</text>
            <text syncTime="315.321" offset="1392806">The point is that there was a great focus on the breadth of the authorization by the Congress to the regulatory agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.426" offset="1433243">We submit in the first instance that the normal rule that contemporaneous regulations adopted pursuant to a broad authorization like this are entitled to great deference has particularly strong application here, where there was such a strong focus on just what those rules and regulations were going to say, where it was a hot issue when it occurred, when there was a debate as to what the scope of those regulations could say.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.296" offset="1548705">It's also important, we think, to express the fact that these impact regulations have been ratified by the Congress on a number of occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.234" offset="1588515">In 1966 Senator Ervin and others who had been serious critics of the 1964 Act focused on the impact regulations and were concerned about them.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.692" offset="1626341">There was an amendment--</text>

            <text syncTime="905.950" offset="3755320">We also think that it's appropriate to uphold these regulations on the grounds that they're reasonably related to the purposes of Title VI.</text>

            <text syncTime="934.536" offset="3869736">such as Section 602 of Title VI,</text>

            <text syncTime="961.604" offset="3977988">The federal agencies have to review thousands of programs, thousands of complaints.</text>

            <text syncTime="971.209" offset="4016440">If they were obliged to use an intent standard like that spelled out in Washington v. Davis, it would be very difficult indeed, if not impossible.</text>

            <text syncTime="993.658" offset="4106197">Justice Stevens again, in Rogers v. Lodge quotes an author saying,</text>
            <text syncTime="998.627" offset="4126050">"Racial attitudes often operate at the margin of consciousness. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.014" offset="4139634">It's hard enough for courts to probe what's going on at that level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.383" offset="4153113">We suggest that it would be virtually impossible for administrative agencies conducting thousands of reviews of federal programs, conducting compliance audits, responding to complaints, it would be impossible for them to do any kind of a meaningful job if they had to use an intent standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.677" offset="4226256">It's more than reasonably related to take an impact approach, at least as a first step to look to see whether a prima facie case has been made out and then get into the question of whether there's justification... the kind of analysis that was done in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.937" offset="4291353">We also suggest that it's clear that if Congress had wanted in 1964 to adopt a constitutional standard, they knew how to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.863" offset="4342971">The did so expressly in Title IV.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.898" offset="4355196">If they had wanted to use a clear intent standard, there was language in Title VII dealing with seniority systems talking expressly in terms of intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.521" offset="4397619">We think that if there had been a determination to make that clear a distinction, they could have done so and did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.777" offset="4422696">We also suggest that there should be a heavy burden on those who say that Title VI and Title VII should be interpreted fundamentally differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.800" offset="4458745">Certainly after 1972, when Title VII was made applicable to municipalities, it would be anomalous, we suggest, to have a fundamentally different standard for discrimination in employment under the two titles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.309" offset="4516842">You get the very result that we think is so odd here, that you'd have a finding under Title VII that the City of New York has discriminated in violation of Title VII, but they could still receive funding under Title VI.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.383" offset="4569087">We think that, as I say, there's a considerable burden on the people who suggest that Congress intended in 1964 to have that kind of a result.</text>

            <text syncTime="1254.177" offset="5148274">There were a lot of cases at that juncture... a recent jury selection case where this Court placed great reliance on impact.</text>

          <turn speaker="leonard_j_koerner" startTime="1300.508" stopTime="1623.247">
            <label>Mr. Leonard J. Koerner</label>
            <text syncTime="1300.508" offset="5333638">Chief Judge and other honorable members of this Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.810" offset="5346804">At the outset we note that, while we did not raise the issue of whether there's an implied right to sue under Title VI because we weren't aggrieved by the lower court decision since we had won on that issue, it is before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.303" offset="5408767">And we recognize that in Cannon this Court indicated there probably is an implied right, but it took pains to distinguish Title IX from Title VI on the ground that at the time Title IX was enacted the legislators assumed that there was a private right, and not whether or not in fact under Title VI there was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.614" offset="5485985">We will not discuss it in depth except to call to your attention that particular issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.185" offset="5504270">What is conspicuous about the Petitioner's argument, both in the briefs and on oral presentation, is the absence of any of the legislative history at the time of the enactment in 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.309" offset="5556829">We do not disagree that some of the regulations after '64 have in effect stated it, but our position is that a regulation which makes impermissible that which the legislative history intends to be legal is a regulation that is illegal and has gone too far and is not reasonably related.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.538" offset="5625687">In 1964 when President Kennedy was addressing the legislature, he asked them to pass laws that would make illegal what was formerly not being enforced under the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.679" offset="5678246">Each of the floor leaders both in the House and the Senate made clear and unambiguous statements in support of Title VI, which was a general funding provision, that the whole purpose of that particular title was to establish a mechanism to enforce the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.990" offset="5751493">Prior to 1963, with the exception of Brown against the Board of Education, each of the courts, including this Court, was troubled by the breadth of the constitutional clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.381" offset="5801126">Indeed, despite the Court's decisions and appellate courts' decisions, there was some question whether the equal protection clause was being enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.887" offset="5835085">As a consequence, Hubert Humphrey and Emanuel Celler, the floor leader, both felt the need to pass Title VI, so that if a particular entity is violating the Constitution, that entity will not be eligible for federal funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.532" offset="5901645">A peculiar anomaly existed where you had entities that were not state entities, and therefore not subject to the state action exception under the equal protection clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.154" offset="5948143">So if an entity was not a state entity and received funds, there was some doubt on the executive level whether they could cut off the federal funding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.844" offset="5982938">Hubert Humphrey mentioned the different areas which the Title VI legislation was supposed to involve.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.183" offset="6008329">One was the distribution of food, the distribution of welfare benefits, the allocation of funding to segregated facilities in the South despite this Court's decision in Brown against the Board of Education.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.638" offset="6054096">And in particular what was most galling was the allocation of funding to hospitals which were operated on a segregated basis, but apparently under the law, even though in violation of the Constitution, could receive federal funding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.112" offset="6108012">The particular case which was among the cases which motivated the Title VI legislation was Simkins versus Moses Cone, which is cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.968" offset="6143434">In Simkins, it was a challenge to the Hill-Burton Act, which was ultimately found unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.872" offset="6167049">But what troubled the Court in Simkins, where cert was denied by this Court, was whether there was sufficient state action for which the Court could apply the equal protection clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.228" offset="6204456">It did conclude there was sufficient state action, but in another case where you didn't have the sufficient state action the Federal Government would be powerless to cut off the federal funding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.767" offset="6242595">The legislation was clear and unambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.702" offset="6254403">More importantly, the cases, which the legislators are presumed to know, at the time of the enactment all support our construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.308" offset="6288780">There was Akins, there were jury selection cases, there were the desegregation cases, Wright against Rockefeller.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.331" offset="6316887">Each case dealt with purposeful discrimination where it was incumbent upon a plaintiff to show that the actions of the government intended to treat one group differently from another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.722" offset="6362445">And that is why Title VI was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.590" offset="6373939">It was precisely for that reason, to set up a mechanism by which you can stop the federal funding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.994" offset="6399539">Reference has been made to the fact that, with respect to the regulations, why delegation was given because the President was required to review each of the regs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.766" offset="6442589">The reason that the President was given this authority was so that the regulations would have a harmonious view of what constituted constitutional violation, and it was hoped that one agency wouldn't cut off funds on a different interpretation of the Constitution than another agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.662" offset="6510194">And indeed, it was contemplated by the legislators that the constitutional definition of the equal protection clause would be an evolving definition, and that what was a violation at one point may not be a violation later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.421" offset="6569230">But the only purpose of Title VI was to conform its standards with respect to the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.825" offset="6594830">We believe that the majority opinion in Bakke supports this conclusion, and while it is true that Bakke--</text>

            <text syncTime="1627.433" offset="6641328">--Well, insofar as the legislative history with respect to Title VI.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.270" offset="6656688">There were at least five judges that commented on the legislative history, and as to the five judges there was a structured approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.257" offset="6688558">The first issue was, what was the scope of Title VI.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.709" offset="6702350">The second issue was, assuming that Title VI was a constitutional scope, whether or not reverse discrimination would be inconsistent with the equal protection clause through Title VI.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.116" offset="6748012">So I am talking only about the majority opinion insofar as it analyzed the scope of Title VI.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.937" offset="6771314">I recognize that there were different opinions with respect to whether reverse discrimination is within the ambit of Title VI.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.110" offset="6800048">Petitioners have cited Title IV in support of their position because they claim that there Congress made reference to the Constitution and therefore the failure to make reference to the Constitution in Title VI is significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.851" offset="6855010">Title IV, to the contrary, supports our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.321" offset="6868803">In Title IV the Attorney General is given the authority to investigate and prosecute claims of desegregation upon claims of individuals who are alleging constitutional violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.129" offset="6916032">But that title assumes a constitutional standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.747" offset="6930556">The reference to the constitutional limitation is in the context of what remedy the Attorney General can seek under Title IV, and in that respect he is limited to the extent that he cannot seek a remedy of busing and he cannot seek any other remedy that'll go beyond the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.293" offset="7000773">If it wasn't for the purpose of limiting the Attorney General's jurisdiction, there would have been no reference to the Constitution and the constitutional standard would have been assumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.331" offset="7044868">In addition, Petitioner claims that you have an anomaly in that municipal corporations were excluded from Title VII and that there is therefore a different test, in that if they discriminate they are subject to a less stringent standard under Title VI than Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.293" offset="7112786">That's specifically what Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.395" offset="7125116">If indeed it was intended to have the same standard both under Title VII and under Title VII, there would have been no reason to exclude governmental entities from Title VII, and those entities were not included until 1972 after a great deal of debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.606" offset="7197945">In addition, with respect to municipal corporations, they were immune from suit under 1983 under Monroe versus Pape, which was familiar to the legislators in Congress at the time of enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.366" offset="7249041">Can it be said that it is likely that Congress, without anything in the legislative history, would have made municipalities subject to an impact standard with the resultant potential loss of federal funding, after they had been immune under 1983, without any comment to that effect in the entire legislative history?</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.197" offset="7336394">And the answer we believe is that it would be very unlikely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.082" offset="7351859">The 1965 amendment which the Petitioners refer to was an amendment that contained many different pieces, one of which was to establish an intent standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.456" offset="7397416">But the proponent of that amendment, Emanuel Celler, indicated that he was putting it in only to clarify what he believed was already there, a constitutional standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.764" offset="7438585">More importantly, there were other factors within that amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.299" offset="7452796">That amendment contained different procedures for Title VI.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.584" offset="7465857">It allowed an entity receiving federal funds to waive the receipt to be beyond the jurisdiction of the agencies enforcing Title VI.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.607" offset="7498040">And finally, it restricted the ability of the agencies, even where there was a violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.677" offset="7518311">So when that amendment failed passage both in the House and the Senate, the reason for its failure was unclear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.247" offset="7548509">And as this Court has remarked many times, any reason to attribute to its failure would be sheer speculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.001" offset="7575572">Again, the only thing that supports the Petitioners' position are the regulations that were passed subsequent to 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.091" offset="7611934">Indeed, there is doubt as to whether those regulations were enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.828" offset="7630847">The only case commenting on the regulations was Brown against Weinberger and the comment generally was that the agencies hadn't enforced it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.851" offset="7667000">And if you review the cases we set forth in our brief after '64 and before this Court's decision in Lau against Nichols, you will see consistently that the courts applied an intent standard and therefore they did not believe the regulations could change the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1952.178" offset="7940241">The impact refinement was a judicial gloss put on by this Court in Griggs against Duke Power solely with respect to one portion of Title VII with regard to testing, where the language indicated that it would be illegal to use a competency exam unless you can show that the exam wasn't being "used to discriminate".</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.460" offset="8033446">The term "used" was defined to create an impact standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.597" offset="8049955">It's also interesting to note that the rest of Title VII has been construed to have an intent standard with respect to disparate impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.703" offset="8086422">So we're talking about the comparison of one isolated section of Title VII, which doesn't result in the calamitous loss of federal funding, with the entire Title VI jurisdiction with the administrative procedure which contemplates both voluntary compliance and a cutback, if that doesn't work, of federal funding.</text>
