            <label>Mr. James T. Winkler</label>
            <text syncTime="58.271" offset="380889">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="61.114" offset="392279">This case is before the Court pursuant to writ of certiorari pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Section 1254.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.830" offset="419133">Respondents, the Operating Engineers Trust Fund, filed a Complaint for fringe benefit collection pursuant to Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.092" offset="460197">The District Court on cross motion for summary judgment granted motion for summary judgment for respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.027" offset="483916">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.931" offset="499590">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in this decision passed on the issue of the enforceability of minority pre-hire agreements and noted in its decision the conflicting decisions of the various circuits and that adopted what it called to be a middle ground between the decisions of the Eighth and Tenth and the... on one hand which state that 301 actions are different than unfair labor practice actions and the conflicting opinion of the Fifth Circuit which adopted the NRLB position that the minority pre-hire agreements are unenforceable unless the union represents the majority of the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.398" offset="665415">The Ninth Circuit adopted what it called a middle ground, that there has to be a notice of repudiation; until then minority agreements are fully enforceable and that the issue of coercion in obtaining the pre-hire agreements is not applicable until that notice of repudiation.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.264" offset="748902">Now, the department interpretation in this case involves an interpretation of Section 8(f) of the Act and this Court's decision in Higdon.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.290" offset="789026">Higdon involved an unfair labor practice matter, and therefore it is important to try and figure out what effect an unfair labor practice context will have in a Section 301 litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.612" offset="850257">And in view of that, it is important to look at this Court's decision in Howard Johnson, which said that the basic policies in an unfair labor practice context cannot be ignored in a Section 301 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.219" offset="908667">In Howard Johnson it involved a Burns successorship issue... excuse me, it involved an attempt by a union to apply the contract of a predecessor to a successor, and then Burns was not allowed in the Section 8(a)(5) context.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.439" offset="1013575">This was again attempted in the 301 context in Howard Johnson, and this Court would not allow that.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.624" offset="1046280">Now, in order to understand the Board's position in Section 8(a)(5), you have to go back to the Board's position in R.J. Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.993" offset="1095808">The Board's case... the case of R.J. Smith was commented extensively by... upon extensively by this Court in Higdon.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.633" offset="1134365">In R.J. Smith it involved an employer which had not complied with the pre-hire agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.424" offset="1165503">According to the administrative law judge before the Board, the administrative law judge said that there's... noncompliance had been concealed from the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.233" offset="1200716">And that's a very important point.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.812" offset="1207090">Despite this active noncompliance by the union, the Board reviewed legislative history and decided that because there was no majority status, that the contract was unenforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.835" offset="1271142">And it is important to note that it did review legislative history and in the... in its interpretation of Section 8(f) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.880" offset="1311371">It noted that there are certain provisions that... there are certain exceptions in Section 8(f) that Congress intended to allow... excuse me... Congress intended to allow for employers to have a steady access of... a steady supply of workmen from the labor organization and to... excuse me... the provisions that Congress wanted to allow in enacting Section 8(f), it wanted to allow employers to have two benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.984" offset="1495795">One was to give the employers an opportunity to have workmen provided by the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.497" offset="1521813">Because employers often go from job site to job site in the construction industry, they don't necessarily have their stable complement of employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.604" offset="1554205">And secondly, pre-hire agreements would allow employers the opportunity to make bids based on a predetermined cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.927" offset="1591508">Now, because of these two benefits, Congress allowed pre-hire agreements to be not unlawful under Section 8(a) and 8(b) of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.986" offset="1643753">But the Board noted that the Section 8(f) language itself showed the limits of its effect, and it noted the proviso to Section 8(f) which stated that an election may be called upon by any... by anybody and it would not despite the existence of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.711" offset="1738630">Now, normally, elections cannot be obtained when there is an existence of a contract in the... in any... excuse me... in any other industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.705" offset="1778649">Now, it is very important to note that right after noting this intent of the proviso, the Board then stated that, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="420.734" offset="1830790">"Thus, the proviso constitutes a statutory safeguard against just the sort of irresponsibly imposed minority union representation which this record reveals. "</text>
            <text syncTime="430.168" offset="1868510">That's a very important quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.837" offset="1875198">I didn't put that in my brief or the reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.757" offset="1886901">The Board then went on and said, because you can file an election petition, it would be inconsistent with this purpose to not allow an examination of majority status in the litigation of refusal to bargain in cases where the employer is refusing to comply with the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.358" offset="1969239">So the old issue in R.J. Smith was the retroactive application... was the retroactive enforcement of a collective bargaining agreement, the pre-hire agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.823" offset="2015110">As a matter of fact, the general counsel of the Board argued that you couldn't look back beyond 6 months, the statute 10(b), statute of limitations, because of this Court's decision in Bryant and the usual presumption of majority status that it can only... usual presumption of majority status in collective bargaining agreement can only be attacked within the last 6 months by filing a charge with the Labor Board showing that it was obtained unlawfully because it was a minority union.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.437" offset="2149588">But the Board said that doesn't matter here, because it's not unlawful to enter into an 8(f) agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.586" offset="2182189">Therefore, we can go back beyond the 6 months and look back, way back to the beginning of the agreement to find out when it was, what kind of an agreement it was, and whether or not there is a majority status to support it.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.503" offset="2229836">So the entire purpose of the R.J. Smith decision was to look back and see whether or not it could be retroactively applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.314" offset="2269124">Now, as I pointed out in my brief, the D.C. Circuit denied enforcement and adopted the theory that respondents argue in their brief that you have to actually file for a petition for an election and until that point in time the contract is enforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.602" offset="2346238">The Board did not take the petition for certiorari at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.757" offset="2366822">It waited until the Higdon case.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.336" offset="2373196">And it's important to note in the Higdon case it sort of reached the issue in the back-door manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.643" offset="2394408">Higdon was an 8(b)(7)(c) matter involving unlawful picketing for recognition.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.077" offset="2420112">And it's important to note that the issue of minority status is not at all involved in the issues, the basic element to an 8(b)(c) violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.121" offset="2472357">An 8(b)(c) violation is made up of basically picketing for an unreasonable period of time not to exceed 30 days where the object is recognitional and there has been no petition filed for an election with the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.663" offset="2530453">That has nothing to do with the minority status of a union.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.861" offset="2547276">The issue only comes into effect in an affirmative defense if the Board has said that the literal terms of 8(b)(7)(c) do not apply in a situation where the union is not seeking initial recognition.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.915" offset="2643511">In other words, if it already has a contract or a bargaining history, then it can... then it can picket for recognition beyond 30 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.162" offset="2676426">However, the Board said that they will not allow that affirmative defense where the recognition is not based on majority status.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.331" offset="2717177">Therefore, the issue of majority versus minority status was joined in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.623" offset="2746329">And the Board relied on its R.J. Smith decisions and its decisions under section 8(a)(5) of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.527" offset="2769944">And the D.C. Circuit again reversed, and that's how it came before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.652" offset="2790424">And as is shown by the petition and briefs to the Court by the Board, this Court passed not only on the 8(b)(7) issue but it, in order to reach that issue, it had to go back and pass on the Board's position in Section 8(a)(5), and it commented on the Board's decision in R.J. Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.380" offset="2857297">And it also commented on and passed favorably upon the Board's decision that minority pre-hire agreements are not enforceable unless the union obtains majority support.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.982" offset="2911737">Now, the Board rule is basically that, when a union obtains majority, the pre-hire agreement is enforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.869" offset="2955309">Until then it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.679" offset="2962519">And you have to look both at the R.J. Smith decision and also look to the Board's brief to find out the reasons for its policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.348" offset="2997209">Basically, it limits the purposes of the statute... excuse me, it limits the adaptation of the statute to its purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.513" offset="3065859">In other words, once an employer obtains union members from the union hiring hall, the skilled pool of employees, then the union will normally obtain majority status, and the agreement is therefore enforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.351" offset="3141196">In situations where they do not obtain that... do not use that pool and the union does not obtain majority status, then the agreement is not enforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.032" offset="3183933">Now, it is very important to look at the basic reasons behind the Board's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.357" offset="3225206">This Court and the Board has said that the voluntary compliance of Section 8(f) agreements, of minority Section 8(f) agreements, is not itself unlawful and has said it's all right.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.601" offset="3286228">Now, the reasons for that is not that the voluntary compliance of the pre-hire agreement is itself good for employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.065" offset="3316112">It is important to note that the voluntary compliance of minority pre-hire agreements is in itself inconsistent with employee rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.656" offset="3350489">It's Just because of this accommodation to the particular needs of the construction industry that it has allowed this exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.653" offset="3390404">And that is why the Board said in R.J. Smith that the record revealed an irresponsibly imposed minority representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.853" offset="3427289">Now, you might wonder why did the Board say that when there is no specific findings that any employee was disadvantaged by that.</text>

            <text syncTime="908.611" offset="3782241">In fact, in R.J. Smith for a certain period of time it did make payments in the trust fund on a few of the union employees, but those employees were still the minority.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.699" offset="3822574">There are several things to note about your situation that may seem inequitable at first blush that employers can wait until that point in time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1258.793" offset="5183031">It simply says that that was an unfair labor practice proceeding and this is a 301 litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.651" offset="5206437">And that I think was discussed and resolved in the Higdon decision itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.430" offset="5229529">And also, it goes right back to the Howard Johnson case that says the basic policies in an unfair labor practice case should not be... should also be controlling in a 301 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.706" offset="5282610">Now, the entire line of cases along there, Howard Johnson, were really ignored by the government in its case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.904" offset="5323466">It just gave a blanket statement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1297.936" offset="5339557">And I think that if you look at my reply brief, you will see that the entire history from Lincoln Mill and Howard Johnson on up to Higdon itself says you just cannot ignore the basic policies in unfair labor practice context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.162" offset="5396504">Now the litmus test to be applied here is the basic polices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.319" offset="5413118">And if you look at those Board cases I cite in my reply brief, all 13 of them, you will find that in those cases where the statutory policies were intendedly applied, the contract was enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.376" offset="5469333">When the employer went to the union hall and got union employees, the contract was enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.888" offset="5487410">And when it was... the employer used non-union employees on non-union job sites, the contract was not enforced because that's against public policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.980" offset="5527743">You should also look, I believe, at the Board's Land Equipment case, which I cited in my reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.645" offset="5562434">Respondents also were involved in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.799" offset="5586989">The Trust Funds intervened in the Board proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.628" offset="5598378">Now, in that case the idea of voidability... a repudiation rule was brought up before the Board, and the Board again rejected it specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.343" offset="5637248">And the Board did find majority status in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.619" offset="5658251">The union did... excuse me, the employer did go to the union hall, got employees, and the employers are bound to honor the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.586" offset="5690120">However, it is only bound to honor the agreement that to a point in time when the union first obtained majority status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.068" offset="5720109">The Board disagreed with the administrative law judge in that case, which gave it retroactive enforcement even before that period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.814" offset="5751038">Now, that case was enforced by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and I didn't cite the Ninth Circuit decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.546" offset="5781967">It was just a memorandum opinion at 649 F. 2d 867.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.699" offset="5806626">So what you have here is the Ninth Circuit in an unfair-practice context enforcing this contract back to the point in time when they had majority but not before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.395" offset="5861379">But in the 301 context the same court would enforce that contract all the way back to the beginning because there was no notice of repudiation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.343" offset="5897219">Now, getting to the issue of the Trust Funds involved in this case, whether or not under Section 306(a) there is some special reason that they shouldn't be bound to the same rules by the NLRB.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.433" offset="5961585">Let me just point out one case I cited in my brief, the District Court case of Sorrenton pointed out in the minority agreement, it's really for the employees to decide whether they want the contract and that includes trust fund benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.192" offset="6024592">And the court would be second-guessing those wishes of the employees if they in fact gave them trust fund benefits or put the... put the entire contract into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.452" offset="6089585">And it pointed out also that trust fund payments to benefit... to employees is not necessarily a benefit to them, it may take away from the ability of the employer to give other--</text>

            <text syncTime="1613.508" offset="6601898">It was a federally funded project, and therefore, under the Davis-Bacon Act they had to pay a certain amount, and that amount was the same as the overall union contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="1909.151" offset="7784409">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.931" offset="7787544">Petitioner McNeff has argued from the viewpoint that because a breach of a Section 8(f) agreement before majority status is achieved is not a violation of Section 8(a)(5) of the National Labor Relations Act, that that breach then cannot be remedied by a suit brought under Section 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.081" offset="7864135">However, we have shown in our briefs that Section 8(a)(5) cases and all unfair labor practice cases are government litigation pursued by the government at government expense to enforce rights and duties that are created by statute under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.762" offset="7934875">By comparison, private rights and duties that are created by private agreement have been left to enforcement according to the normal processes of the courts under Section 301 litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.053" offset="7984089">That is a tandem system of handling labor disputes that has served the country well since 1947 when Section 301 was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.421" offset="8025467">There is no reversal involved of any Section 8(a)(5) case in enforcing the contract rights in a judicial action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.637" offset="8070398">Those Section 8(a)(5) cases would be exactly as valid with the enforcement of contract rights in this Section 301 action as they are presently; namely, the government would not issue a Complaint and would pursue litigation as a matter of public policy to enforce a contract when majority status is not shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.970" offset="8151691">We have shown in our brief at least two clear similar circumstances in which... one of which this Court has recognized in the Iron Workers case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.278" offset="8204981">For example, Section 8(e) agreements, the hot-cargo clauses, are not enforceable by picketing, just as the minority agreement in Iron Workers was not enforceable by picketing because of the limitations of Section 8(b)(7).</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.100" offset="8264226">However, those hot-cargo clauses are clearly enforceable by judicial action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.847" offset="8291185">In addition, we have also shown the Pittsburgh Plate Glass decision of this Court, in which it clearly recognizes the established rule of law that nonmandatory subjects of agreement may be included in collective bargaining agreements, and when they are, they are judicially enforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.779" offset="8354924">However, they are not enforceable by government litigation under Section 8(a)(5) cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="2555.768" offset="10370845">When those bids are accepted, the employer is bound contractually to perform by them, and he needs reliable labor costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.860" offset="10403237">Otherwise, he is substantially at risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.391" offset="10413373">Secondly, to the same extent, it is very common in the construction industry that time is of the essence in performing a construction contract once he gets the winning bid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.431" offset="10453601">Therefore, he needs a ready source of labor that he can call on immediately in order to perform the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.039" offset="10484008">It's not common at all for the way construction projects develop and bids are won, the employer normally cannot afford to keep a full staff of workmen on his staff and on his payroll.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.190" offset="10532595">He must have a source of workmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.284" offset="10540955">And he needs that on a reliable, a contractually reliable basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.672" offset="10558509">Now, from the union standpoint, there were also two objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.937" offset="10575541">The unions needed to have some approach to stabilize working conditions in their geographic areas over a period of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.306" offset="10609082">And the legislative history clearly recognizes that they had been doing that by the practices of signing agreements applicable to geographic areas over 1, 2, or 3 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.756" offset="10650878">I would cite the legislative history, since it has been questioned in the reply brief, pages 423 to 25, pages 451 and 52, page 759 and 777.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.189" offset="10696540">Clearly, it was the intent of Congress to validate the practice of signing binding contracts that would stabilize working conditions within an area so that the union and the employer would not have to bid on a project or to bargain on a project-by-project basis after the employees got out on the site where there could be disruption of work at the job site.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.290" offset="10780968">And fourth, the fourth objective is also a union objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.460" offset="10801657">Congress recognized that because of the high mobility and the short... shortness of jobs in the construction industry, that the construction unions did need certain organizing mechanisms that were out of the ordinary for other industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.579" offset="10862156">One of those, they recognized that the unions needed an exclusive hiring hall to refer their workmen out, and they also recognized a need for the 7-day union security clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.323" offset="10905101">Both of those objectives, both of those mechanisms are expressed precisely in the wording of Section 8(f).</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.318" offset="10941046">Now, I refer to those objectives in some detail because they must be examined to recognize that every one of those four objectives of Congress requires a binding contract in order to achieve it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.424" offset="10993500">Congress looked at the existing law at that time and said that, well, they've got to have a binding contract in order to achieve those objectives; right now they have to show majority status before they can sign that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.014" offset="11047835">Now, if they were... if we were to follow that approach, we would have to be ready for the NLRB to conduct elections and every bargaining unit from the construction industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.852" offset="11095273">And clearly, the legislative history says at several places it's not feasible in the construction industry to contemplate having elections in every unit in order to certify the union as the bargaining agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.953" offset="11151593">They said, therefore, because of that, the infeasibility of elections in every unit and because we need these four objectives under the circumstances of the construction industry to be met, we are authorizing the pre-hire agreement, we are validating the practices that have been used by the unions, and we are doing it by enacting Section 8(f).</text>

            <text syncTime="2802.388" offset="11357333">And let me say this about the prospect of a transfer wholesale of the employee representation issues in the construction industry from the Board, where it's been for the last 25 years, into the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.021" offset="11419923">The courts simply do not have the capacity to continue absorbing the additional doses of litigation that they're getting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.454" offset="11457644">The litigation arena is too crowded already.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.327" offset="11473108">And under such a ruling, under 301 cases, both the state and the federal courts would then be involved in litigating majority status issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.561" offset="11510097">It's doubly troublesome to contemplate moving employee representation issues from the Board to the courts for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.586" offset="11542176">If anything, the litigation burden on the courts would indicate that legislatively those burdens should be moved from the courts to administrative tribunals.</text>

            <text syncTime="2949.407" offset="11945402">That's what's before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.217" offset="11952716">It is unenforceable from the standpoint that the government will not pursue litigation at government expense under Section 8(a)(5) to enforce that agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.040" offset="11992004">So that... that would stand completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.007" offset="12003812">And as a matter of fact, I would like to point out in regard to the ERISA Amendment that basically the same government attitude toward the enforcement of these private rights is maintained in ERISA, because while the ERISA Amendment creates the statutory right or obligation to perform the contract, there is also a part of that amendment that says the Secretary of Labor will not initiate litigation to enforce that contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.998" offset="12107779">And so basically, it is simply a situation that the Board has said and ERISA has said that the government is not going to expend its agency resources to enforce this as a matter of public policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.572" offset="12154068">However, under the ERISA Amendment, they did add the provision that entitles the private trustees to recover their costs of pursuing that litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.631" offset="12190326">So in that respect of what the ERISA Amendment did is simply add the statutory obligation that 8(a)(5) doesn't provide for performance here, it adds the statutory obligation but again it leaves the litigation in private hands just as it was under 301.</text>

            <text syncTime="3217.171" offset="13016527">And the only... the only point that Congress saw fit to protect was that enabling employers and unions to step into this vacuum and deal with binding contracts on the basis that met the needs of both parties was the proviso... they didn't want the employers and the unions to stick the employees with something that the employees didn't want.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.974" offset="13119763">And as a matter of fact, in looking at the legislative history on the purpose of the proviso, the clearest explanation I find of exactly what Congress had in mind and what was bothering it on the proviso appears in the... in the Committee Print of the Senate Subcommittee on Labor that was published right at the time the Joint Conference adopted the Senate version of Section 8(f).</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.465" offset="13221640">And that proviso, or that explanation on a section-by-section basis explains the proviso with a more limited purpose even than what we have discussed so far.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.068" offset="13264063">It says this: Agreements permitted by this section may not operate as a bar to a petition for an election sought by a union not party to such agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.051" offset="13303978">You look at the legislative history in light of that explanation, and what Congress was really worrying about when it added the proviso is they... and the legislative history shows clearly they were concerned about sweetheart contracts between corrupt employers and paper unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.152" offset="13376390">I cite the the Committee statement of the legislative history at page 967.</text>

            <text syncTime="3459.916" offset="13987446">They are now arguing essentially that, yes, it ought to be litigated in the... in the courts.</text>

I don't think you're going to... you're going to say that every time you sued on a pre-hire agreement and the employer said... said, sorry, but I am repudiating right now, you're not going to wage a losing battle, you're not going to litigate forever when you know you don't have majority status.</text>
