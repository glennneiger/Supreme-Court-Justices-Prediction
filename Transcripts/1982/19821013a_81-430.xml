            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="153386">We will hear arguments first this morning in Illinois against Gates.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.785" offset="176478">Mr. Biebel, I think you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_b_biebel_jr" startTime="19.878" stopTime="450.526">
            <label>Mr. Paul B. Biebel Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="19.878" offset="232798">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="23.246" offset="246277">This is a search and seizure case.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.615" offset="255786">It involves the question of whether or not probable cause for the establishment of a search warrant can be established where an anonymous letter is sent to a police department and many of the items of that anonymous letter are then corroborated by the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.041" offset="317539">Here, pursuant to a search warrant, the car and the apartment of Lance and Susan Gates were searched and large quantities of drugs were seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.516" offset="359440">However, a motion to suppress was granted by the trial court, DuPage County, Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.920" offset="380965">That suppression was affirmed by the Appellate Court of Illinois and affirmed once again by the Supreme Court of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.340" offset="406669">Certiorari was granted by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.275" offset="418477">The pertinent facts are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.144" offset="429866">On May 3rd, 1978, the Bloomingdale, Illinois Police Department received an anonymous letter which was postmarked May 2nd, 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.702" offset="472184">That letter said that there was a couple living in Bloomingdale, Lance and Sue Gates, who lived on Greenway in the condominiums who made their living off drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.391" offset="518891">Most of their buys, according to the letter, were done in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.212" offset="538222">Sue would drive a car down to Florida; Lance would fly down later and drive the car back.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.449" offset="563090">The letter specifically stated that on May 3rd, Sue would be driving down to Florida and Lance would be flying down a couple of days later to drive the car back.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.125" offset="613873">The letter stated that the car would contain $100,000 worth of drugs in the trunk, and that there are about $100,000 worth of drugs in the couple's apartment in the basement.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.747" offset="660370">Further, the letter said that the Gates brag about the fact that they don't have to work and that they make their money off pushers.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.937" offset="689105">Finally, they indicated that the Gates's were friends with drug dealers who visit their house often.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.657" offset="715959">Upon receipt of this letter on May 3rd, 1978, the case was assigned to Detective Charles Mader of the Bloomingdale Police Department who did several things to check whether or not this letter was accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.916" offset="773010">First of all, he checked with the Illinois Secretary of State to ascertain whether anybody with a driver's license by the name of Gates lived in Bloomingdale, and he checked and he found out that, indeed, a Lance Gates lived in Bloomingdale; however, he lived on Dartmouth Avenue, which was different from the letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.026" offset="837481">The Secretary of State provided a description of Mr. Gates.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.747" offset="852318">He was a male, white, born in 1947, brown eyes, brown hair, five feet, eleven, 220 pounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.151" offset="881889">Because of the discrepancy in the information of the Secretary of State, Detective Mader went further and checked with an anonymous informant who had provided reliable information in the past, which gave him information from financial records which his informant had which indicated that Mr. Gates lived on Greenway, which was consistent with the letter, and that his prior address was on Dartmouth, which would indicate that he had let his driver's license, in effect... he didn't follow it up with the new address.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.491" offset="1015322">Detective Mader then went and checked with the Chicago Police Department who has responsibility for O'Hare field and ascertained that an L. Gates was slated to go out on Flight 245 on Eastern Airlines to Atlanta and West Palm Beach, Florida at 4:15 on May 5th, which would be consistent with the letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.004" offset="1109363">A phone number was given for L. Gates, who had registered.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.558" offset="1127544">Detective Mader then contacted the security office of the Illinois Bell Telephone Company and found out that that phone number was an unlisted number to Lance Gates who lived on Greenway Drive in Bloomingdale, Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.651" offset="1183969">Detective Mader then checked with the Drug Enforcement Administration, and they had an agent out at O'Hare field waiting to watch the people get on Flight 245.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.541" offset="1231512">A man identifying himself as Lance Gates and meeting the description got on that plane.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.529" offset="1251469">Drug Enforcement agents were in Florida when that plane landed and they watched Mr. Gate get off the plane, they watched him stay at the airport for about an hour, and then they observed that he took a cab directly to the West Palm Beach Holiday Inn.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.639" offset="1319910">He was observed entering the room, registered to Susan Gates.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.193" offset="1338091">The record will not reflect what time he arrived, but it had to be about 8:00 o'clock, considering the lapse in time and the delay of an hour in the airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.732" offset="1376230">Within 12 hours, at 7:00 o'clock the next morning, Mr. Gates and an unidentified female left, checked out, got into an automobile with license plates registered to Lance Gates and headed back on the interstate, presumably towards Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.760" offset="1444357">A check of the license plates indicated that the plates were registered to a car other than being driven in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.847" offset="1472674">It was estimated by the drug agents that the driving time from West Palm Beach, Florida to Bloomingdale, Illinois was about 21 to 23 hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.638" offset="1511858">Now, this was May 6th in the morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.590" offset="1523665">In the evening of May 6th, which was a Saturday, Detective Mader went and presented his information to a judge who issued a search warrant for the car and for the apartment based on the anonymous letter and the corroboration of the letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.997" offset="1581344">The search warrant was executed at 5:14 the next morning, which was some 23 hours after the Gates's had left Florida, which would indicate virtually a non-stop trip.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.872" offset="1628782">In the trunk of the automobile were several large bundles of marijuana weighing about 350 pounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.811" offset="1660547">A search of their residence uncovered more marijuana, weapons, ammunition, drug paraphernalia, several scales presumably for the weighing of the drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.885" offset="1708926">The couple also had cocaine in their possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.987" offset="1721255">Both were indicted for unlawful possession of cannabis with intent to deliver and unlawful possession of a controlled substance, and Lance Gates was separately indicted for possession of an unlicensed firearm.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.747" offset="1772351">However, a motion to suppress was granted by the Circuit Court of DuPage County, Illinois by Judge William Hopf who indicated that neither prong of the Aguilar or Spinelli test were met here.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.555" offset="1819580">There was no indication in the letter of the basis of the knowledge of the letter writer, and there was nothing to substantiate his reliability.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.376" offset="1850823">That was affirmed by the Appellate Court of Illinois Section District in 1980 where that court, admittedly disagreeing with several state and federal cases, held that corroboration by the police can only be used to satisfy the veracity prong of Aguilar and Spinelli and cannot be used to satisfy the basis of knowledge prong.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.074" offset="1945595">And since there was no basis of knowledge indicated,--</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="450.526" offset="1955417">Counsel, where did all this prong lingo come from?</text>
            <text syncTime="455.847" offset="1976733">Is that in Aguilar itself?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_b_biebel_jr" startTime="457.965" stopTime="475.260">
            <label>Mr. Paul B. Biebel Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="457.965" offset="1985197">--Aguilar just set out at the end of the opinion the two steps that have to be utilized when informants are used.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.536" offset="2015499">I think it was explicated in the Spinelli case, and certainly there's been a great deal of comment by courts and a Law Review article since about the two-prong test and how it's described.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="475.260" stopTime="481.597">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="475.260" offset="2054369">You think Aguilar and Spinelli intended to cover the whole waterfront insofar as probable cause and warrants--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_b_biebel_jr" startTime="481.597" stopTime="815.646">
            <label>Mr. Paul B. Biebel Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="481.597" offset="2079760">We would certainly contend not so, Your Honor, and that's the basis of our case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.132" offset="2097837">If Aguilar and Spinelli... we would argue that Aguilar and Spinelli ought to be carefully re-examined by this Court in view of the fact that it's overly formalistic and it's confused courts and police officers and prosecutors.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.774" offset="2144439">But beyond that, I don't think that Aguilar and Spinelli was meant to apply to a situation such as here where you have an anonymous letter writer who volunteers information.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.481" offset="2191250">I think there's a distinct difference between that and a police informant where there may well be ulterior motives by a police informant to lie.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.353" offset="2226777">The Appellate Court of Illinois, taking this formalistic approach, said we're sorry, but the corroboration of the police can only go to veracity and it can't go to the basis of knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.930" offset="2281007">And so there wasn't any facial indication of basis of knowledge on the affidavit for a search warrant; it had to fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.251" offset="2306294">The Supreme Court of Illinois affirmed the appellate court but didn't go quite as far.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.369" offset="2326774">In an opinion by Mr. Justice Ward over dissents by Mr. Justices Moran and Underwood, they held that neither prong was met.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.391" offset="2358852">They didn't feel that the corroboration in this case of what they described as clearly innocent activity was sufficient to meet either prong.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.347" offset="2398767">However, they didn't get to the question of whether or not corroboration can be used to supply the basis of knowledge prong.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.353" offset="2426770">The dissents, however, said in that case that every detail of the letter was corroborated, like Draper versus the United States, and consequently, both prongs were satisfied and probable cause was properly granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.613" offset="2483822">It is our contention in this case, Your Honors, that probable cause here for the issuance of a search warrant was properly shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.950" offset="2517154">The probable cause standards enunciated by this Court in cases such as Draper, Brinegar, Carroll, is whether the facts and circumstances are such as to warrant a reasonably prudent man to believe that a crime has been committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.395" offset="2578908">And when search warrants are involved, the question is whether or not the items are probably present in their location.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.799" offset="2608478">Since probable cause requires less evidence than is required to justify conviction, hearsay can be used to establish probable cause as long as there is a substantial basis for crediting the hearsay, as this Court has enunciated in Jones, Rugendorf, Harris and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.844" offset="2680681">Here, the hearsay evidence supplied by the anonymous letter writer, coupled by the corroboration of the police of the details of the letter, were sufficient to warrant a reasonably prudent man in believing that the drugs were probably located where the anonymous letter writer said they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.190" offset="2762078">This letter described a classic drug run rather than an ordinary social or business trip.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.927" offset="2793007">And the predictions of the letter are exactly what occurred--</text>
            <text syncTime="663.629" offset="2807845">Lance Gates flew down to Florida, a place that the Drug Enforcement Administration has identified as a major port of entry of illegal narcotics into the United States; a point that this Court can take judicial knowledge of, as it did in Carroll with the role that Detroit played with regard to illegal liquor during prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.792" offset="2888511">He stayed less than 12 hours in Florida, turned around in the automobile that his wife apparently had brought down there and drove back virtually non-stop to Bloomingdale, Illinois, arriving at his apartment in the early morning hours of a Sunday.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.539" offset="2963535">The letter was correct, therefore, not only in its conclusion that the Gates were running drugs, but also in the specifics of the trip.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.495" offset="3007316">Now, the Supreme Court of Illinois has gone off and said that this was clearly innocent activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.167" offset="3038036">We would like to note that that should not make a difference as long as that activity, along with the tip itself, is enough to supply probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.373" offset="3078787">Certainly, in the Draper case which I'll make reference to in a minute, you had clearly innocent activity which, combined with a tip, was judged to be enough for probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.748" offset="3116299">Furthermore, there is an absence of an apparent motive to lie in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.902" offset="3140958">With police informants who are often either paid or receive some sort of leniency or protection or perhaps pressure to produce information by the police, there are oftentimes those pressures to lie.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.577" offset="3199682">Here, the anonymous letter, however, volunteered the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.196" offset="3218072">And therefore, it should be given credence like a citizen informant and presumed to be credible.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.433" offset="3243045">Consequently, because of the detail of the letter which indicated specifically the time that they would go down to Florida and how they would come back, which proved to be true, because of the absence of an apparent motive to lie, because of the extensive police corroboration in this case which took in three police departments, post office, financial records, because of the inherently suspicious nature of the trip, which was a short round-trip staying less than 12 hours in an area known to be source of narcotics, because of the issuance of a search warrant--</text>

            <text syncTime="818.081" offset="3425693">--It occurred in May, Judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.381" offset="3430813">All taken together, all these factors taken together we believe amply justify the judge's determination of probable cause, particularly when you view that preference ought to be given to search warrants as opposed to warrantless searches, as this Court has often said in cases such as Ventresca.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.494" offset="3511270">I might note that probable cause has been found by this Court in cases with less evidence than presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.017" offset="3541363">In Adams versus Williams, an opinion of this Court, 1972, a policeman in Bridgeport, Connecticut in the early morning hours was told by an informant, who had only given information on one prior occasion and that had to do with alleged homosexual activity in a railroad station which did not result in any arrest because it had been unsubstantiated... that person told the police officer that the defendant was sitting in a specific location in an automobile; that he had a gun in his waist and that there were substantial amounts of drugs in the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.004" offset="3677304">The police officer went up to check the man, asked him to open the car door.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.642" offset="3699874">He simply rolled down the window.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.177" offset="3710010">The policeman then reached in and found a gun in the man's waistband, precisely where the informant said it would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.414" offset="3738953">On the basis of this, he then had a warrantless search of the automobile and the man's person and found heroin... substantial amounts of heroin, both on his person and in the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.424" offset="3790989">This Court, in an opinion by Mr. Justice Rehnquist, said that when we're dealing with probable cause we're dealing with probabilities; we're not dealing with technicalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.231" offset="3838219">And since the gun was found precisely where the informant said it would be, then it predicted... was reasonable to corroborate the reliability of the informant that drugs would be in the car as well as the gun in the man's waistband.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.359" offset="3910735">The theory of Adams was premised upon Draper versus the United States where a reliable informant precisely described the attire that Mr. Draper would be wearing, that he would be carrying a tan zippered bag and that he would be walking quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.421" offset="3990983">He also indicated that Mr. Draper would be getting off a train from Chicago in Denver, and he would be carrying heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.462" offset="4027136">The police watched the train for two days.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.164" offset="4041974">The second day they saw a man meeting that description get off the train, carrying a brown zippered bag and walking quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.353" offset="4074784">On the basis of that information, they stopped the man, they searched him without a warrant and they found three ounces of heroin on him, as the informant said they would.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.126" offset="4117833">This Court found there was probable cause in that case because the preciseness of the description in Draper gave support to the truthfulness of the statement that Draper was carrying heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.235" offset="4174258">We contend that this case is stronger than either Adams or Draper because here there was extensive police corroboration of activity that was less innocent than either Adams or Draper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.395" offset="4230891">In Adams, the man was sitting in a car; in Draper the man was simply getting off a train and walking away quickly, carrying a bag.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.482" offset="4259313">Here we have all the earmarks of a trip to obtain drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.119" offset="4277807">Lance Gates flew down to Florida, stayed 12 hours, drove his car non-stop back to Bloomingdale, Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.707" offset="4308214">Because the anonymous letter writer in our case was precisely correct in the way the trip would go down, in the days... concerning the days that the trip would take, it was, we believe, a justifiable decision by the court that this would indicate that the further allegations of the anonymous letter were true, too, and that is that they were carrying drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.876" offset="4420854">And, in fact, that was the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.876" offset="4424824">Probable cause should therefore be granted in this case, as it was in Adams, as it was in Draper, which I said were both warrantless cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.517" offset="4467352">If there is a question in favor or not in favor of a case if a warrant has been issued, then preference ought to be given to the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.872" offset="4500788">However, the difficulty arises in cases such as this because of the application by the lower courts of the two-prong Aguilar and Spinelli test to a situation involving other than a police informant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.065" offset="4561602">Here we have an anonymous letter writer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.584" offset="4571633">Because a hearsay declaration is unknown to a magistrate or a judge who is required to determine probable cause for a warrant, the two-prong test was established to require police to state to the judge first of all, the basis for why they believe that the informant has veracity, and secondly, what information the informant has to indicate that he believes that a crime has been committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.520" offset="4691378">But according to some courts, including the Appellate Court of Illinois in this case, when information comes from other than a police informant... in this case, an anonymous letter writer, volunteering information... the information is per se defective if there are not enough... there isn't a basis for the knowledge facially indicated on the request for a warrant or on the letter, and there are not enough facts to permit self-verification, as this Court utilized in the Spinelli case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.924" offset="4828991">The appellate court citing Judge Moilan, who is often cited in this area in his case, Stanley versus the State, an intermediate appellate court in Maryland, 1974 opinion, that police corroboration, though relevant in determining veracity, cannot be used to satisfy the basis of knowledge prong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.357" offset="4914777">We respectfully contend that that conclusion finds no support in the opinions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.261" offset="4938392">It reduces the standards of determining probable cause to ones of form over substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.331" offset="4962633">And furthermore, it avoids the mandate of this Court in Ventresca that Fourth Amendment issues ought to be considered in a common sense fashion rather than an over-formalistic fashion because search warrants, requests for search warrants are often drafted by non-lawyers in the midst and in the hiatus of criminal investigations, which is just exactly what occurred here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.613" offset="5055838">The police really had a very short time in order to whether or not this information was reliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.684" offset="5080080">We find it ironic that under the appellate court opinion, which has accepted the Moilan theory, that a basis for knowledge can be obtained by non-corroborated statements in a letter, but cannot be supplied by the kind of extensive corroboration seen in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.078" offset="5157611">If the appellate court theory is maintained here, then an anonymous letter which does not supply sufficient facts to indicate a basis of knowledge can never be utilized for the determination of probable cause because the corroboration by the police simply can't be used to bolster the basis of knowledge prong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.142" offset="5237859">It simply defies common sense, because corroboration can be utilized not only to show the veracity of a declarant,... and certainly this Court has said that... but also to indicate that there are enough verified facts to justify a finding that the letter was not based on conjecture or on rumor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.322" offset="5322601">In the Draper case, certainly, the self-verifying facts only became verified because the police corroborated what occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.078" offset="5357605">They saw that the man had the same clothing as the informant said, that he was carrying a bag as the informant said, and that he would be walking quickly.</text>

            <text syncTime="1695.717" offset="6936237">Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.435" offset="6947104">This case involves the question of whether the search warrant naming the defendants, their home and an automobile, based upon an anonymous letter and absent any exigent circumstances, with no police observations of any criminal activity, informed the issuing magistrate of some of the underlying circumstances from which the anonymous tipster concluded that the narcotics were where he or she claimed they were, and some of the underlying circumstances from which the magistrate could have concluded that the tipster, whose identity was unknown, was credible or his information reliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.993" offset="7109272">I start off, if I may, with that statement and couch it in the terms of the Aguilar case because I believe in our opinion, our feelings and our theory from the trial court up until today have been the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.403" offset="7162979">We have read the opinions of this Court in Aguilar and Spinelli.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.372" offset="7178862">We have postulated them to both the trial judge, the Illinois Appellate Court and the Illinois Supreme Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1785.391" offset="7294950">As stated in Spinelli, Draper was a suitable benchmark for a comparison in terms of the two-pronged or two-basis test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.647" offset="7327969">In Draper, however, we had, as the court stated, a reliable informant with a past track record, compared to the Gates case, there was an anonymous letter which I described as written in the third person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.538" offset="7375512">The letter writer stated facts and conclusions, talked about the trip to Florida on May 3rd by Mrs. Gates, talked about him flying down, and was incorrect in terms of the corroboration that my opponent suggests because the letter writer, the anonymous tipster, said she would fly down... or drive down, rather, leave the car to be loaded with drugs and fly back immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.670" offset="7472060">When the police, the DEA, watched Susan Gates into the room, they saw her get into the car with Mr. Gates the next morning, contrary to what the letter writer said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.128" offset="7517827">The letter write said she'd leave the car and fly back immediately; contrary to that, she got in the car.</text>

            <label>Mr. James W. Reilley</label>
            <text syncTime="1955.753" offset="7976328">My answer to that, Your Honor, is specifically this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.288" offset="7986464">That this Court has said that the probable cause standard for a search warrant, now, for a search warrant as opposed to an emergency on the street as in Adams versus Williams where there was perhaps a danger to the police officer or to society because of a gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.596" offset="8039753">Specifically, this Court said that hearsay can now be the basis for a search warrant, as opposed to the direct observations of an officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.869" offset="8068802">In addition, the Fourth Amendment commands require that a magistrate be neutral and detached and not be a rubber stamp for the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.772" offset="8096387">So keeping that as the guideline that we're going to use hearsay and not direct observations of the swearing police officer who stands before the magistrate, there must be some guideline or some test to protect the citizens and their Fourth Amendment rights from unreasonable searches and, of course, the police to ferret out crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.650" offset="8163887">Keeping that as the basis, Your Honor, my answer to your question is no, this does not establish probable cause because the judge who signed the search warrant had absolutely no way to know whether the letter writer had a grudge, picked up this information in a neighborhood bar, as this Court has said on occasions, gossip in the underworld, that type of conversation.</text>

            <label>Mr. James W. Reilley</label>
            <text syncTime="2033.019" offset="8285409">--Yes, sir, that's true, but there is a way to find out if there's any way to credit that hearsay, and this Court has enunciated that; with either the past track record of reliability or as in Harris, a statement against one's penal interest to add some reliability to it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2050.298" offset="8354477">If you're dealing with a police informer, a knowledgeable police officer can have his affidavit drawn in such a way that to the extent he truthfully can he puts forth the requirements set forth in the cases of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.688" offset="8408080">But when you're dealing with an anonymous tip, you can't say well, you really ought to have said a little more on this subject.</text>

            <text syncTime="2072.294" offset="8442457">And you're saying, in effect, you can't act on it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2079.984" offset="8473282">I certainly do not say that they do not have a place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.436" offset="8483104">However, I will say that the anonymous tip in this case, even with the corroboration, contrary to my opponent's view, I do believe that this Court has stated that the corroboration of what an anonymous person says, or what a reliable says, the corroboration itself cannot give the court or the issuing magistrate the ability to find out where he found that information out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.432" offset="8571084">Whether he heard it... corroboration, or even a reliable informant could fabricate out of the whole cloth, as this Court stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.336" offset="8598669">Could lie in detail or lie generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.971" offset="8609223">So we don't know just by corroboration of facts subsequently... in fact, if we use the corroboration approach of my opponent, the corroboration was not specifically as the letter stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.113" offset="8653735">As a matter of fact, the letter writer did not give the specific address of the Gates's; he gave no physical description... he or she gave no physical--</text>

            <text syncTime="3469.695" offset="14032139">To clarify what Mr. Justice Stevens and Mr. Justice White asked me when I was up the last time, that is, we agree with Nathanson that the conclusory assertion standing alone of criminal activity is not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.268" offset="14086369">But here, as I've pointed out, there's been much more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.287" offset="14098490">The type of detail that is in this letter, indicating specifically that Susan Gates would leave on May 3rd, that Lance Gates would leave a couple days later, which proved to be true, indicated that the information had to come from somebody who was intimately connected with this criminal enterprise, as this Court said in Spinelli.</text>

            <text syncTime="3503.749" offset="14168289">Mr. Biebel, may I ask you another question about the possible distinction between the car and the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.420" offset="14190963">In your brief you made the point that one of the corroborating circumstances tending to support the conclusion that the drugs might have been in the apartment was the fact that the informant said that the woman would go to Florida and leave the car and come back before the husband left, so that the apartment would not be unattended for a long period of time, indicating probably concern about what was in the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.435" offset="14279048">But yet, when they verified the facts, that scenario did not take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.970" offset="14297229">Instead, she stayed in Florida until he came down there and they did in fact leave the apartment unattended, which would seem to undermine the basis for the suspicion that goods were in the apartment during that interval.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.628" offset="14347802">So I would think there would be less basis for your conclusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="3557.282" offset="14382493">But there was only a two-day stretch that the apartment was left unattended--</text>
