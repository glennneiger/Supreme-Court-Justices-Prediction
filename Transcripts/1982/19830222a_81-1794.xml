            <text syncTime="66.455" offset="406003">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="72.260" offset="429304">The issue in this case is whether a state criminal defendant is entitled to federal habeas corpus relief on the grounds that his assigned appellate counsel failed to raise every non frivolous issue requested by the Defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.971" offset="496073">The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that he is and created a pro se rule that appellant counsel is automatically ineffective if he fails to raise an issue that meets two tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.945" offset="544034">One, it has some possible merit, however slight; and, two, it was requested by the Defendant on a very generous construction of the term "request".</text>
            <text syncTime="113.320" offset="593562">That decision is wrong for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.155" offset="604847">It upsets state convictions without any showing of prejudice to the Defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.390" offset="625745">It is not required by any principle or constitutional law or sound judicial administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.794" offset="651449">It undermines rather than promoting effective assistance of appellate counsel, and it is an unmanageable, unworkable rule that requires courts to probe the attorney client relationship after the fact and distinguish requests that would trigger the rule from suggestions or discussions or things mentioned in passing that would not.</text>

            <text syncTime="154.061" offset="756461">The question presented in the cert petition is whether the 6th and 14th Amendments require assigned defense counsel to raise every non frivolous issue requested by the Defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.688" offset="811005">What I would like to ask is whether the questions, whether the Respondent, in fact, asked his lawyer to raise the issues and whether they were non frivolous are questions before us?</text>
            <text syncTime="181.097" offset="864608">The briefs talk about them a lot but it was hard for me to understand that those questions were properly here.</text>

            <label>Ms. Miss Barbara D. Underwood</label>
            <text syncTime="188.667" offset="894910">Well, the question... whether a particular question is non frivolous, being a question of law, it seems to me, is necessarily before this Court and the predicate for determining whether the rule stated by the Second Circuit is... was appropriately announced in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.400" offset="993862">The question of whether a request was made is in part a factual question and while that matter is discussed at some length in the brief, it is unnecessary for this Court to explore the intricacies of the attorney client relationship and decide whether a request was made in the ordinary sense of that term.</text>

            <text syncTime="239.950" offset="1100024">Yes, except for this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.519" offset="1106293">The Second Circuit gave a particular meaning to request, and it would be misleading to understand the Second Circuit rule as applying only to that case in which there was a square conflict between attorney and client in which an explicit request was made and that request was refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.262" offset="1169301">The Second Circuit's definition of request for purposes of its rule encompasses much more.</text>

            <text syncTime="288.231" offset="1293121">Well, since so much seems to turn on this, Miss Underwood, could you briefly summarize what, in fact, did happen?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="miss_barbara_d_underwood" startTime="294.602" stopTime="607.365">
            <label>Ms. Miss Barbara D. Underwood</label>
            <text syncTime="294.602" offset="1318616">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.204" offset="1321020">What the record shows is that before appellate counsel was appointed, the Defendant drafted a pro se brief which included a number of issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.713" offset="1383087">After his appellate counsel was appointed, he sent that brief to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.950" offset="1403985">There was some correspondence between Defendant and counsel in the course of which a number of issues were discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.489" offset="1442228">The record includes a letter from counsel to the Defendant which says, I have considered these various issues, and I believe that none of them are supported by the record, however, here are seven more issues which I am thinking about raising.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.582" offset="1502518">And ultimately counsel filed a brief which included three issues from counsel's list of seven.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.354" offset="1533656">He also filed Defendant's original pro se brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.140" offset="1552778">Defendant drafted another pro se brief which included some more of the issues from counsel's list and those too were before the Appellate Division.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.829" offset="1587573">So, there was much discussion between attorney and client about issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.548" offset="1602411">That is what the Second Circuit found to constitute a request.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.802" offset="1619443">I should say that the record is sufficient to show that the Defendant... That counsel's performance satisfied both the farce and mockery standard for effective assistance of counsel and the more demanding standard of reasonable professional competence.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.531" offset="1706378">The District Court, the Second Circuit, and this Court have before it all these various briefs, which are in the Joint Appendix and that excerpt from the attorney client correspondence that I have described, all of that is sufficient to show that counsel painstakingly reviewed the issues and made a reasonable selection of them, giving attention to Defendant's concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.214" offset="1797075">If this Court were to find some possible merit in the Second Circuit's pro se request rule, it should, nevertheless, reverse rather than remand in this case because of the extra ordinarily broad notion of requests that satisfied the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.956" offset="1860083">A hearing in the District Court would be necessary, which is what this discussion about the record suggests, only if this Court were to adopt the extraordinary rule that the omission by counsel of any issue mentioned in communication between attorney and client raised a rebuttable presumption of ineffective assistance and then a hearing would be necessary to permit the state an opportunity to rebut the presumption and inquire into the nature of communications between attorney and client and discover why particular issues were or were not raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.512" offset="1990277">But, since it is our position that that rule in not what the Constitution requires, no further exploration of the facts is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.633" offset="2026744">The Second Circuit's rule requires counsel to suppress professional judgment and simply transmit arguments to the court instead of submitting a brief that counsel believes would be most effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.762" offset="2095289">The Second Circuit suggested that this was a natural extension of Anders, this Court's decision in Anders, but, in fact, this decision... and this situation is totally different from the situation in Anders... that governs the situation where counsel finds no meritorious issues and his professional judgment would lead him to withdraw the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.841" offset="2183583">In that case, this Court held that counsel must set forth the possible issues any way even though he regards them as lacking in merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.297" offset="2221408">The Anders defendant doesn't lose the benefit of professional judgment because counsel's professional judgment would be of no benefit to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.851" offset="2251606">By contrast, in a case like this one, where counsel has a strategy for effective presentation of the appeal, then the Second Circuit rule would suppress that strategy and require counsel to replace it with a laundry list brief, with a brief simply listing what may well be a large number of issues which, in counsel's judgment, would render the brief less effective rather than more.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.334" offset="2349617">Such a list of issues which Anders, in fact, requires may be better than nothing which is what the Anders defendant would otherwise get, but it was not better or more effective than a carefully constructed presentation based on reasonable, professional judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.694" offset="2418998">The selection of issues for appeal is plainly a strategic judgment, the sort of strategic judgment appropriately assigned to counsel, and not one of the small number of decisions that are appropriately reserved for the Defendant personally.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.607" offset="2506665">The number of colorable issues that could be found in combing a record is potentially infinite.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.075" offset="2528504">It is counsel's job.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.813" offset="2547521">It is quintessentially the job of counsel to shape that raw material into a form that is easily digested by the appellate court.</text>

            <text syncTime="613.000" offset="2592243">Suppose you had a case in which there was a clear request and a clear refusal by the lawyer for tactical reasons.</text>

            <text syncTime="635.099" offset="2680641">I would say that the omission of a particular issue might well constitute ineffective assistance of appellate counsel either because that issue was itself so strong that any reasonable lawyer would raise it or because the client's particular reasons for wanting that particular issue raised were so compelling that they ought to overcome whatever strategic judgment the lawyer might otherwise make.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.314" offset="2781474">My objection rather is to this pro se rule that makes a request dispositive of the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel without the sort of case by case inquiry that seems to me most appropriate for adjudicating claims of ineffective assistance by counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="711.327" offset="2985542">Neither of those documents squarely address the issue of the selection of issues for appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="912.157" offset="3788860">Would that be a ground for not applying the waiver principle then in your view?</text>

            <text syncTime="921.113" offset="3824700">Well, I would say that in the ordinary case that would constitute a waiver; that is that reasonable strategic judgments of a lawyer do, in fact, bind the client and they bind him not only on the direct appeal but also for the purposes of making the procedural waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.890" offset="3895753">However, the fact, if it were a fact, that there was this kind of difference of opinion, might well constitute cause for avoiding that waiver principle in a particular case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1236.497" offset="5086205">The rule is not an effective... a necessary or effective way of providing equality to indigent defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.786" offset="5123403">First, the Constitution does not require the state to make the relationship between an indigent defendant and appointed counsel identical to the relationship between a paying client and retained counsel and, in any event, that could not be done.</text>

            <text syncTime="1276.157" offset="5244821">It is expensive to change lawyers after one lawyer has already spent a great deal of time on the case, and it is expensive to ask one lawyer to research and write on a large number of insubstantial issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.315" offset="5297483">Many paying clients lack the complete control over counsel that the Second Circuit seems to assume they have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.819" offset="5323501">Indeed, in the wake of the Barnes decision, the Second Circuit decision in this case, our office has received habeas corpus petitions from paying clients who claimed that their retained counsel failed to raise certain issues that they requested and asking for the same right that indigents have under the Barnes decision below; that is to say that at least some paying clients lack the kind of control the Second Circuit rule would give to indigents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.638" offset="5438754">There obviously is a wide range of control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.507" offset="5450247">There is a wide range of paying clients, and the amount of money somebody has available to him is very likely to affect the kind of control he has over his client as well as the kind of... over his counsel as well as the kind of counsel he gets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.902" offset="5519838">And, in any event, the constitutional guarantee at stake here is a right to effective counsel, not a right to any particular form of attorney client relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.609" offset="5562678">The right is not meant to provide indigents with equal control or equal opportunity for self expression or any other of a variety of possible forms of equality that indigent defendants might like to have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.501" offset="5614192">It is to provide them with an equal chance for meaningful appellate review of their convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.671" offset="5638956">A breakdown in the attorney client relationship might operate to prevent meaningful, effective appellate review, but there is no suggestion that that happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.694" offset="5678976">Where counsel has consulted with the client and paid attention to his concerns and ultimately made reasonable, strategic judgments about how to frame the appeal, the constitutional right to counsel on appeal is satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.405" offset="5745849">There is... The Solicitor General has suggested that there may be a problem about state action in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.915" offset="5803945">I think it is clear that there is enough state action in holding a convicted defendant in custody to require that the procedures by which the conviction is obtained and upheld satisfy constitutional standards and that includes the requirement of effective assistance of counsel at trial and on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.459" offset="5878029">But, again, that right, that constitutional right, is a right to meaningful counsel to effective appellate review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.299" offset="5905405">In fact, this Court has held that that applies... that that may be limited only to the first mandatory appeal and not to subsequent discretionary appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.838" offset="5947619">But, in this first mandatory state appeal, the requirement is of meaningful counsel and that requirement was satisfied here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.931" offset="5999968">The omission of an issue then could well amount to ineffective assistance of counsel, but that judgment shouldn't depend on whether or not the defendant made a request.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.070" offset="6044481">In fact, it would be peculiar to penalize the defendant too ignorant to make a request.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.374" offset="6069767">It should depend on whether the issue was sufficiently substantial so that reasonable counsel would have necessarily raised it or on whether the particular request was sufficiently weighty that reasonable counsel would have acceded to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.770" offset="6143328">Neither of those kinds of omissions is shown by this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.576" offset="6182512">On appeal the defendant is entitled to effective assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.528" offset="6194319">The proper standard is not the pro se rule set forth by the Second Circuit, but a flexible standard of reasonable, professional competence applied on a case by case basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="3325.146" offset="13440791">A few brief points, if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.998" offset="13456256">First, there is no suggestion here that there was a failure of communication or a lack of participation by the client.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.538" offset="13490424">The only question that this case is about has to do with ultimate control, not participation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.692" offset="13518949">Second, every point that the Second Circuit said should have been presented, was, in fact, before the state appellate court in the form of a pro se brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.900" offset="13559805">So, there is no denial... no total denial of access here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.452" offset="13578091">Third, though an attempt has been made to distinguish between strategy at trial and strategy on appeal, it is perfectly plain that there are important strategic judgments to be made on appeal as well as at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.027" offset="13628350">There was one particularly salient one here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.813" offset="13639531">The client was concerned about the fact that a particular medical record, having to do with... by which he wanted to impeach the complaining witness, did not get into evidence.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="3384.269" offset="13677356">So, your position would be the same, though, wouldn't it, if the client himself had not filed a letter with the appellate court?</text>
