            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="8.713" offset="127334">Well, this case comes to us by way of certiorari to the -- to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.471" offset="158368">It's an antitrust case that centers in Section 2(a) of the Clayton Act as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.661" offset="195148">The case doesn't lend itself very well to description from the bench.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.829" offset="215837">I think it suffices to say that the petitioner is a Louisville Kentucky brewer which sold its beer to the respondent, the sole wholesale distributor for petitioner's beer in Evansville and Vanderburgh County, Indiana, at a higher price than the petitioner charged its only distributor in Henderson County, Kentucky, just across the Ohio River.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.618" offset="322939">Under Indiana law, brewers were required to sell to all Indiana wholesalers at the same price and wholesalers were prohibited from selling to out-of-state retailers and retailers could not purchase beer from out-of-state wholesalers.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.111" offset="392947">The respondent distributor sued the brewer, alleging price discrimination that violated the Act and the trial court held that the distributor had established a prima facia case.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.052" offset="444670">That court rejected the brewer's defense that it was merely meeting competition in Kentucky and hence was immune from liability and the Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.083" offset="492839">In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we reverse that judgment and remand the case for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.128" offset="520947">We do hold that competitive injury was shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.695" offset="535262">The defense of meeting competition, however, is not defeated on the theory that the price difference resulted from increases in Indiana rather than decreases in Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.083" offset="584790">The standard governing the requirement of a good faith response is the standard of prudent businessman, responding fairly to what he reasonably believes is a situation of competitive necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.878" offset="644036">The trial court did not address the crucial question whether the Kentucky prices remained lower than the Indiana prices in response to competitor's prices in Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.108" offset="672875">And for that reason we reverse and remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.144" offset="701088">The decision is by unanimous court.</text>
