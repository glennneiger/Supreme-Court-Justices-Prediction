            <text syncTime="59.805" offset="375433">The issue before this Court is whether a municipality is obligated by the Constitution to reimburse a hospital for the cost of medical treatment rendered to a person suspected of a crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="76.095" offset="440635">On September 20th, 1978, the Revere police were called to respond to a reported burglary at a dwelling house in Revere, Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.653" offset="482849">The police arrived at the scene, observed an individual leaving the home with a suitcase and a pillow-case, and this individual was later identified as one Patrick Kivlin.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.930" offset="531959">As a result, the police sought to detain him, and Mr. Kivlin attempted to flee.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.487" offset="562156">After repeated warnings and a warning shot, Mr. Kivlin was shot by a police officer for the City of Revere.</text>

            <text syncTime="858.939" offset="3571985">Suppose Mr. Kivlin, the suspect, had had a gun, and in the circumstances of this case had fired a shot that hit that bystander prior to the time that the policeman felled Mr. Kivlin with his bullet.</text>

            <text syncTime="916.167" offset="3800922">I would like to address a threshold issue for a moment, that is, Massachusetts General Hospital's challenge to the jurisdiction of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.772" offset="3851286">According to Massachusetts General Hospital, only State law issues are involved in this case, and there is... or at least there is an independent and adequate State law remedy to support... State law grounds, excuse me, to support the judgment below.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.780" offset="3919309">This view rests on a single premise that the opinion below was based upon a State created implementing rule, a matter of State law, and that what the Supreme Judicial Court did was merely create a so-called implementing rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.539" offset="3998408">This viewpoint distorts the clean language of the opinion below as well as the State law precedents relied on by the Supreme Judicial Court in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.987" offset="4040204">The language of the opinion could hardly be plainer.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.250" offset="4065177">After rejecting all forms of State law contractual recovery, the court below held and I quote:</text>
            <text syncTime="990.669" offset="4098927">"We hold that the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment embodied in the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution requires that Revere be liable to the hospital for the medical services rendered Kivlin during his first stay. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.413" offset="4165905">Later in the opinion, in its section entitled "Eight Amendment", the court characterizes the position of the hospital as follows:</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.155" offset="4228808">"The hospital argues that the prohibition against deliberate indifference to the medical needs of prisoners contained implicitly in the Eighth Amendment compels a government agency, or division responsible for supplying those medical needs, to pay for them. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.446" offset="4294009">In response to this assertion, the Supreme Judicial Court responded with two words, "We agree".</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.241" offset="4321177">The opinion below that Revere must be liable to the hospital is clearly a matter of Federal law and is clearly derived in the minds of the Supreme Judicial Court from the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.920" offset="4387841">There can be no independent and adequate State law ground to support the judgment below since the Supreme Judicial Court held in the first part of the opinion that it would be illegal for Revere, under the circumstances of this particular case, to pay Massachusetts General Hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.554" offset="4474463">Under the law of the Commonwealth, Massachusetts has strict rules against allowing any form of contractual recovery against a municipality unless the prerequisites to a valid contract are in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.139" offset="4540710">Therefore, the phrase that Mass. General uses in this context, its implementing rule, is simply a polite way of trying to reintroduce its theory of an implied contract, implied contract that requires that Revere pay the bill of Mass. General.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.177" offset="4640916">This theory was rejected by the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.971" offset="4660037">Therefore, there is no State law ground upon which to rest the judgment below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.110" offset="4684592">Rather the judgment below clearly rests upon the Supreme Judicial Court's erroneous interpretation of the United States Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1626.410" offset="6641895">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.673" offset="6682855">The initial question in this case is in fact the question of jurisdiction and the question of standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.233" offset="6705112">The Petitioner, of course, has the burden of establishing that jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.730" offset="6727159">Nonetheless, the Petitioner comes to this Court arguing now that the hospital lacks standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.508" offset="6762267">The hospital suggests to the Court that on the basis of that allegation and that argument, the Court should properly dismiss the writ of certiorari, accepting the Petitioner's claim that there is no standing in the Federal sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.548" offset="6834365">I suggest that the resolution ought to be to dismiss the writ and not to reverse the court below, because, of course, the State court is freer to fashion a broader rule of standing than the Federal court would be.</text>

            <text syncTime="1697.039" offset="6924331">By citing Barrows against Jackson, they simply followed or intended to follow the Federal rule of standing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1703.130" offset="6948677">I think in order to determine what the court in fact did, Justice Rehnquist, we might look very closely at that footnote 7 on page 26 of the Appendix to which my Brother has already referred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.017" offset="6992249">The footnote consists of two, and only two paragraphs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.452" offset="7006042">The first paragraph acknowledges that there may be a question of standing but finds it waived, clearly as a matter of State law, citing the applicable State rule of appellate procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.118" offset="7052645">My Brother construes the second paragraph as a decision on the Federal question of standing, and I firmly disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.256" offset="7089216">The second paragraph starts out,</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.084" offset="7096530">"Furthermore, standing to litigate constitutional issues is sometimes granted to persons. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.409" offset="7121817">The court is making clearly the observation that it would not be unheard of, as a matter of jurisprudence, for a third party to have standing in a case like this, but I find nothing whatsoever in that paragraph that suggests that the Supreme Court purports to decide or in fact has decided that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.292" offset="7197363">Indeed, the two references in the paragraph to which my Brother has already referred, the two Federal references, are preceded by a C cite and a CF cite, and I suggest that is not the way that the court would have decided the Federal issue, if it purported to do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="2722.624" offset="11026705">I would like to address, at least briefly, some questions that were raised by the Court in the City's argument, the question of other obligations that might exist for the provision of care by the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.274" offset="11093265">My Brother made a reference to a State law, by which I assume he meant the patient's bill of rights in Massachusetts... Massachusetts' general law is Chapter 111 Section 70(e)... which in fact did not become effective until the year following the events that gave rise to this case and, therefore, as at least a technical matter, has no bearing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.467" offset="11186052">But I would like to read the first words of the relevant section of that part of the statute that talks about the right of a hospital patient.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.339" offset="11221578">It gives the hospital patient the right to prompt lifesaving treatment, not emergency treatment, prompt lifesaving treatment in an emergency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.428" offset="11265882">Clearly the State Legislature in that statute has cut out a much more circumscribed area of medical care than my Brother would have suggested, I think, in his argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.408" offset="11317814">In our brief, we have also cited relevant sections from the Medicare Hospital Manual at footnote 58 on page 34 of the brief, where the Federal government, at least an agency of the government, very clearly takes the position that medicare payment may not be made for services provided to prisoners because the State or other governmental agency is already responsible for their medical care.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.052" offset="11440380">In general, the position of the hospital is, first, that the Court ought not reach the merits because it should find that the State Court was free to have decided the case under State rules of standing, but that, as argued by the Petitioner, this Court ought not to proceed to decide this case, the standing question on the merits, should accept the allegation of Petitioner, and should dismiss the writ for lack of standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.052" offset="11592413">But if the Court were inclined to go further, we suggest, first, that the decision is not a constitutional decision, but is an implementing decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.329" offset="11625536">While the State Courts do not have the authority to misinterpret the Constitution, they should clearly be allowed the authority to craft a remedy that might be somewhat broader than a Federal Court could do in seeking to protect the underlying constitutional rights, in order to protect in advance and make it unnecessary for a prisoner later to bring an action for damages, clearly a less satisfactory alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.084" offset="11732534">Finally, insofar as there may be some disagreement among Members of the Court, or some uncertainty in the mind of the Court as to the exact basis of the decision on either point, whether State or Federal, the hospital suggests in conclusion that that it would be more appropriate to ask the State Court what was intended than to presume to tell it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2963.121" offset="11988638">So that it is clear that what the court below did was to base its ruling on an erroneous interpretation of the Federal United States Constitution, and not any sort of State law implementing remedy.</text>
