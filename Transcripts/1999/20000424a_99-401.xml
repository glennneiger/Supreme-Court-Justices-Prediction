            <text syncTime="76.004" offset="446560">This case presents the question of whether the State of California can force political parties to choose their nominees for public office through a blanket primary system which is expressly designed to produce more moderate nominees than those that are favored by the parties themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.531" offset="504656">Under California law, the only means by which a party can nominate his candidates for the ballot is through the blanket primary system.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.752" offset="533600">The blanket primary makes the issue of party affiliation and ideology irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.858" offset="553975">It allows any voter to cross party lines and to vote in several different party primaries at the very same election.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.331" offset="579889">It is a wholesale assault on the party... political parties' First Amendment right to choose the standard-bearer who best represents the party's ideology.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.425" offset="616251">This case is a direct descendent of this Court's decision in Tashjian, which held that Connecticut could not enforce a closed primary law on a party that sought to open its primary to Independent voters.</text>

            <text syncTime="143.086" offset="714890">In California... to begin with the open primary, the generic open primary exists in a State where there is no party registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.108" offset="746968">Voters come to the polling place, if they're registered they go into the polling place, and in a classic open primary State I believe that they are given the ballots of any political party and they make a choice of which party that they vote in.</text>

            <label>Mr. George Waters</label>
            <text syncTime="180.568" offset="864832">I don't think so, Your Honor, and I think that there are quantitative and qualitative decision differences here between an open primary and a blanket primary, and if I could go into that, I think the qualitative difference is that suggested by Justice Powell in his dissent in the LaFollette case, which involved another issue, but in which Justice Powell discussed at some length the issue of the validity or the constitutionality of open and closed primaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.795" offset="973711">And Justice Powell's position there was that what the First Amendment guarantees to the parties is the right to have... to limit their nominating process to voters who affiliate with the party.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.987" offset="1018537">He said the question presented in that case, which dealt with Wisconsin, an open primary State, was whether there was an act of affiliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.059" offset="1046749">What Justice Powell said is, when a Wisconsin voter chooses the ballot of a Democratic or Republican Party, that in itself is an act of affiliation because that voter is choosing to limit him... hisself or herself to the nominees of one party.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="241.994" offset="1110488">But isn't that just a matter of degree, because... simply because the decision can be made on the spur of the moment when the voter gets to the polls?</text>
            <text syncTime="249.952" offset="1142357">The only right that the voter has in the open primary State that the voter does not have in the blanket primary State is the kind of mix-and-match right.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.005" offset="1182586">If the voter who has traditionally been either not registered, or registered as a Republican, takes a Democratic ballot in the open primary State, there's no more affiliation between that voter and the party than there is the voter who under the blanket system chooses to vote for... in the Democratic primary for Governor and the Republican primary for State Treasurer.</text>

            <text syncTime="287.137" offset="1291046">I think that the history of the American regulation of political parties is distinct, and what we have is a history where the Government in virtually every State has operated to try and make it easy for people to affiliate with a party, but in States that have party systems, and California has a party system, Proposition 198 itself, when you register to vote, it's in Proposition 198 you actually state that you affiliate with a political party.</text>

            <text syncTime="353.065" offset="1554779">And in a case in a State in which the State law is, well, you can't require a 30-day affiliation, you can't require anything more than the instantaneous affiliation, isn't the sense of affiliation just as ephemeral there as is the sense of affiliation between in a blanket primary State the fellow who walks in and says, I guess I'll vote for a Democrat for Governor and a Republican in the Treasurer's race?</text>

            <text syncTime="3323.000" offset="13434537">--That's correct, also.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.820" offset="13437776">I mean, there were no political parties, and people came to the polls and elected the candidates they wanted for office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.731" offset="13469437">In sum, if I may, if this Court were to accept the petitioner's argument that just allowing outsiders in were to severely burden the party to the degree that it's unconstitutional, this total party autonomy approach, it would in California, as Professor Eugene Lee has pointed out, decrease voter turn-out again, it would increase alienation with the parties and the party leadership, something that's already there, it would increase the Independents getting a larger registration, and it frankly would weaken the two-party system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.984" offset="13598481">More importantly, as Justice O'Connor asked earlier, it would jeopardize all of the open primaries across the country, and primaries that allow same-day registration and States that don't even require recordation, or allow people to maintain their party affiliation in private.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.328" offset="13671833">Ultimately, the thrust of that argument is down the slippery slope that even primaries themselves could not stand up against that argument of total party autonomy.</text>
