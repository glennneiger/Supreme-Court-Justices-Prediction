            <text syncTime="372.317" offset="1626524">You...  you mentioned a moment ago, quite correctly, that under any reasonable suspicion rule, some innocent people are going to be stopped or are liable to be stopped under that rule, and we accept that.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.297" offset="1670514">That's...  Terry...  Terry starts on that premise.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.897" offset="1680858">The...  the trouble is how high is the risk that...  that innocents are going to be stopped or...  or how many innocents are going to be stopped in relation to the...  to the whole?</text>
            <text syncTime="399.067" offset="1733521">That...  that seems to me the tough question.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.501" offset="1743239">And the reason it's a tough question here...  I'd like you to comment on it...  is that it seems to me that if we accept your premises, where in the high crime area a clearly identified police officer arrives...  and in fact, in this case arrived as...  I guess in a convoy of...  of four cars...  it seems to me that anyone in his right mind is going to want to get out of the way fast.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.705" offset="1852117">If I were standing on that corner, I don't know whether I would run or duck into a...  an alleyway or what, but I would want to get out of the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.417" offset="1886912">And therefore, it seems to me, on your premise, there are going to be a substantial number of quite innocent people who, recognizing the spot they are in, are going to go on and get just as far away from the police and any shoot-out or whatnot that may occur as they possibly can.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.000" offset="1957234">And it raises the specter of simply too many innocent people getting picked up on your rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="476.798" offset="2044483">Here the governmental interest is a police officer who's on the scene, sees an individual look at him, and take flight.</text>

            <text syncTime="1549.405" offset="6334938">The purpose of the Terry stop is to resolve ambiguities, and in United States v.
