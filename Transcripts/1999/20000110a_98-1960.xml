            <text syncTime="296.508" offset="1325587">There are three circuits that have adopted a restrictive interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.335" offset="1340947">Justice Scalia, to get back to your question, we think that a permissive interpretation of the FAA's special venue provisions is not only supported by the language of these provisions, and although it may be possible to read them otherwise we do think that the most natural reading is a permission to use different venue statutes, but you also have to look at the context in which these provisions were enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.807" offset="1462782">As we indicate on page 14 of our opening brief, where Congress has intended special venue statutes to be restrictive, it has frequently, though not always, used explicitly mandatory or restrictive language.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.193" offset="1520356">Moreover, permissive interpretation is consistent with the structure of the Federal Arbitration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.128" offset="1548046">If a restrictive interpretation is adopted, the Federal Arbitration Act would not provide enforcement of arbitrations that are conducted abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.231" offset="1588484">However, as this Court indicated in the Scherk case, the FAA as originally enacted was intended to apply to such arbitrations.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.556" offset="1625786">As a consequence, a restrictive interpretation would create a gap in the venue created by the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="477.890" offset="2051164">Under respondents' interpretation the parties can only agree to a venue if that pertains to an application to vacate and it is in an arbitration agreement, because that is the only type of forum selection clause that is specifically referred to in the FAA, so they would construe, for example, sections 10 and 11, which do not contain any specific language concerning forum selection clauses, to exclude such clauses.</text>

            <text syncTime="981.714" offset="4066459">As every court of appeals that has considered the question has concluded, they must be interpreted in tandem so that they are either all restrictive or all permissive, and in our view, since section 9 is clearly permissive, sections 10 and 11 have to be construed as being permissive as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.643" offset="4134168">Now, this interpretation is also supported, as I said earlier, by the structure of the act, by the venue gap that would result, and also by the unexplained distinction that would be created by a narrow interpretation between sections 9, 10, and 11, and the Federal Arbitration Act's other special venue provision in section 204.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.777" offset="4214730">We also think that a permissive interpretation is independently supported by the presumption that special venue statutes are supplemented by the general venue statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.444" offset="4257362">This presumption, which courts and commentators have found implicit in this Court's decision in Suarez, is based upon Congress' historical practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.939" offset="4291321">Historically, Congress has used special avenue statutes in order to expand, not restrict, the venue available under the general venue statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.999" offset="4331550">Moreover, as I indicated before, where Congress has intended a special venue statute to be exclusive, it has normally used explicitly restrictive mandatory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.026" offset="4375644">This suggests that, in the absence of such restrictive or mandatory language, the special venue statute should be interpreted to be supplemented by the general venue statute, and this presumption is supported by important pragmatic consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.988" offset="4435517">There are hundreds of special venue statutes in the U.S. Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.813" offset="4454848">If all of these venue statutes were interpreted restrictively, then the general rules that section 1391 attempts to create would be subject to a patchwork of arcane and perhaps unintended exceptions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1326.814" offset="5446874">As I have already suggested, I think that the value or the benefit of that rule is significantly undermined by the fact that there is concurrent jurisdiction in the State courts for Federal arbitration proceedings.</text>

Cone, the Federal Arbitration Act does not provide for independent Federal subject matter jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.094" offset="5807990">As a consequence, a case that was between two parties resident from the same State, or that otherwise did not satisfy diversity jurisdiction, could not be brought in Federal court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1431.747" offset="5866609">As a consequence, some actions at least to vacate, modify, or correct arbitration awards will have to be brought in State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.101" offset="5915928">Now, there is another problem with respondent's interpretation as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.473" offset="5937453">According to their interpretation, in 1925, when Congress passed the Federal Arbitration Act it intended to exclude application of the general venue statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.313" offset="5980817">At that time, however, the general venue statute basically provided only for venue in the residence of the defendant, and respondent has failed to suggest any reason why Congress would have wanted to prevent applications to confirm or to vacate or modify to be brought in the residence of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.602" offset="6058035">Finally, Your Honors, I would suggest that their interpretation would complicate the arbitration process itself, because it would make parties less likely to reach compromises and accommodations in the arbitration process when they are determining where the location of the arbitration should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.734" offset="6138492">That question, as it stands now, is often quite contentious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.825" offset="6158867">If that were given the added significance of determining where future litigation would be conducted, parties would be less likely to reach compromises, and I think that's particularly true for parties such as petitioner, who is from a rural area in Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.258" offset="6220621">He may be willing to agree to accommodate the convenience of arbitrators to conduct an arbitration in another State, at a major airport that has a hub, but he would be unwilling, or at least less willing to conduct an arbitration there if he knew that any subsequent litigation would be conducted there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.061" offset="6303795">In sum, Your Honors, I think that a permissive interpretation is supported by the language of the FAA, by the context in which that language is used, and by the structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.978" offset="6355517">It is also supported by the presumption that special venue statutes are supplemented by the general venue statute, and by the policies of the Federal Arbitration Act and the more reasonable and sensible nature of the rule that it would create.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.379" offset="6417061">If there are no more questions, I would like to reserve any remaining time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="3058.149" offset="12372144">That court has the case, and if that court retains jurisdiction of the case, then that court can handle later proceedings, because these are, again, simply venue provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.037" offset="12411746">But getting back to, I guess, an earlier question I'd like to complete the answer to, and that is, why can't we just assume that the general venue statutes... why can't we just apply this liberally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.656" offset="12470155">Well, first of all, venue is not something that you simply apply liberally out of some overriding policy consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.779" offset="12494710">You have to look at what is intended, and you have to apply it as it was written, and second, the section 10 and 11, particularly in contrast with section 4, simply cannot be read to leave that door wide open.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.009" offset="12551657">And I also would point out, as we have in our briefs, that looking at the history of this section, looking at the broad venue provision that Congress rejected out of the New York statute in favor of the very limited provisions, it's clear that they wanted to have this to be a limited venue provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.191" offset="12620307">I'd like... I'd also raise one other practical consideration, and that is, a number of arbitrations in modern day are consolidated, where there may be multiple claims, multiple awards cases, you know, A versus B, C versus D, A versus D, you know, where the arbitrators are trying to make a number of decisions among a number of competing interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.384" offset="12713094">If venue is open, is wide open, what you're going to have is challenges and motions under section 9--</text>

            <text syncTime="3151.412" offset="12745172">Isn't that what 1404(a) is meant to accomplish, though, and district judges, recognizing that one action is better than five, or even two, will say, okay, this is a place of proper jurisdiction and venue, but we're going to transfer to that other so that all the arbitrations will go forward... isn't that a typical use of 1404(a)?</text>

            <text syncTime="3209.202" offset="12976408">--Then presumably any of those cities would be an appropriate forum if the award is made in a number of different places, with different aspects heard in different places.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.121" offset="13020085">In light of the comparison between section 4 and section 9, 10, and 11, also the contrast between 9, 10, and 11, there really is only one reading that can be had of this statute, that the intent of the Congress is clear, and that the default provision for venue, the provision that will apply in the cases where there is not already a pending case, or whether there's not post arbitration agreement, is going to be where the arbitration award took place, where the hearing took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.808" offset="13170759">Congress has determined that that is presumptively a proper forum, and that it simply should not be subject to later litigation as to whether there might be some, you know, arguably better forum for that proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.101" offset="13219974">Treating it like, as though it's an appeal process, it's a review process, where, for example, the arbitrator might be subject to discovery, witnesses might have to be called with respect to allegations of fraud and the like--</text>

            <text syncTime="3286.031" offset="13283713">Your answer that if a motion to compel arbitration is brought in one court, that court could retain jurisdiction, cuts against your now answer that this is like an appellate proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="3300.526" offset="13341705">Answering the question why this Congress would do it, it seems that that's the way they viewed it, that they viewed this as something which naturally ought to flow upstream through the same location, but certainly there are circumstances where that would not necessarily follow, and that would be cases where there is jurisdiction that has been lodged in a particular court, or where the parties simply waive venue objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.421" offset="13449225">But looking at the statute as a whole, and looking at a comparison of this statute with the broader language of the New York statute that served as its model, and that Congress rejected in favor of this very closely delineated provision for venue, it's very clear what Congress had in mind and, as this Court has held, has often held, venue is not something that this Court can simply apply in a way that seems convenient, or any court, but it is a matter of statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3408.109" offset="13771994">Well, Your Honor, we have not had the opportunity to brief that question, but I would add... I would point out that there are what I think several difficulties with a response like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.963" offset="13831448">The first is, I think that it is unfair to require a party like the petitioner, who has objected to arbitration being conducted in a particular place, to force them, whether through a... an absolute rule, as respondent is suggesting, or through a presumptive rule, to litigate post arbitration proceedings in that district.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.970" offset="13919429">The second thing that I would add is that some of the problems that I pointed out about a restrictive interpretation of sections 9, 10, and 11 would also be created by a presumptive rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.090" offset="13971987">In particular, it would burden the arbitration process itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.354" offset="13989019">The prearbitration sparring, in some cases, over where an arbitration should be located would be complicated as much by a presumptive rule as it would be by an absolute restriction.</text>
