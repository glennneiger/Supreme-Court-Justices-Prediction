            <text syncTime="32.803" offset="269544">This reflected a long tradition in both Federal and State law under which firearm type was an element of the offense, of the various offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.926" offset="310086">Firearm type is frequently contested at trial, and is the kind of issue that juries normally resolve.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.764" offset="337462">Based on its reading of legislative history, the lower court in this case found for the first time that, in essence, the jury is a lower level gatekeeper in the sense that it finds facts justifying a 5-year period of incarceration, but opening the door to factual findings by the sentencing court according to the preponderance-of-evidence standard that justify a 30-year sentence, as in this case, or, in the case of a second conviction, life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.968" offset="466193">The section in question, the first part of the section, sets forth elements for the lower level offense in some 83 words.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.990" offset="506318">If you looked at from whoever to 5 years you'll find the various elements, you'll find the Federal jurisdictional nexus, and we submit that Congress, in a very concise manner, instead of repeating all of that wording, simply set forth the concise way of speaking that if the firearm is, and then to give a list of firearm types, then the punishment is of another--</text>

            <text syncTime="149.388" offset="735882">So those are basically the elements, and when Congress amended the law in 1986 to include other firearm types, it simply sets forth the wording that if the firearm is, and in this case in '86 the amendment was a machinegun or a firearm that's equipped with a firearm silencer or firearm muffler, and those were treated as elements of the offense up until basically this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="248.895" offset="1133988">I think this Court indicated in the Jones case about the Federal carjacking law that it characterized the initial part of the statute as describing some pretty obnoxious behavior without saying that it's unlawful, but then you get to the penalty clause and then it's obvious that that's an offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.106" offset="1210788">And this Court first held in the Simpson case back in the post '68 period that 924(c) is an offense and it's not just a sentencing factor for some other crime, because--</text>

            <text syncTime="534.668" offset="2277002">So when Congress enacted this, there's nothing in the legislative record, although we think that legislative history is a... not something that overcomes the doctrine of constitutional doubt or the rule of lenity, but when you actually look at the legislative history, it does not state that these are sentencing factors and not offense elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.402" offset="2387970">You simply have references to the fact that these are mandatory sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.037" offset="2410540">The provision as adopted in 1968 had mandatory... a mandatory sentence for carrying and use of a firearm, and with the 1986 amendment you have a mandatory sentence for machineguns and firearms equipped with silencers, and then over the years you have other amendments which put in short-barrel shotguns and rifles, and destructive devices, and there simply was no legislative history... you'll see two paragraphs of legislative history in the Fifth Circuit opinion, and it in no way makes clear that these are offense elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.145" offset="2558915">The statute is written in a way such that there are 83 words in the first clause which gives the offense elements, and in a very concise way it doesn't repeat all of the Federal jurisdictional nexus.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.690" offset="2633103">It does not... it's not redundant in other words, and it was set forth in a way that there was never any question in the... either in the legislative history or in the way that this law was administered in the Federal courts up until this case was decided that indicated in any way that the firearm types are not offense elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.322" offset="2735607">We think that by making the jury in essence a lower level gatekeeper which finds facts resulting in a 5-year period of incarceration, and then giving it to the sentencing judge to find by a mere preponderance, that those do implicate the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, the Indictment Clause of the Fifth Amendment as well as the Due Process Clause and the right to jury trial and the right to be informed of the nature of the accusation in the Sixth Amendment, and by interpreting the law to mean that these are offense elements, there is no constitutional doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.167" offset="2907075">That resolves the constitutional doubt against an interpretation that raises that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.802" offset="2925570">If you want to go back in history, this long tradition of both Federal and State law under which these are offense elements, as far as Federal law goes we go back to the National Firearms Act of 1934, and for the first time Congress made it unlawful to possess or to receive unregistered machineguns and the short-barreled shotguns and some other types of firearms, and it was an offense element then.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.071" offset="3038628">In the 1968 act, there are various offenses under title I of the act related to machineguns, short-barreled shotguns and other... and destructive devices, and those are invariably elements of the offense, and so if we were to take respondent's position we would assume that Congress simply did not make these elements without any indication that these were nonelements and without any structural provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.625" offset="3172897">In other words, it was not written in a way that these are not elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.827" offset="3185645">In the carjacking case resolved by this Court in Jones, you'll see the same identical structure in this statute as exists with section 924(c), namely that whoever engages in certain action, in that case takes a car by use of a firearm, using intimidation or force or violence, shall be sentenced to a certain amount and, in the case of this statute, whoever uses or carries a firearm in a crime of violence prosecutable in a Federal court will receive a certain sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.666" offset="3332976">And in Jones, as in this case, it says, and if, the and-if clause exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.320" offset="3359620">In other words, with Jones, and if there's bodily injury then the sentence is of a different type, and in this case, and if the firearm is a machinegun or destructive device, then there's another sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1288.919" offset="5294040">So by the same token, here, in 924(c) a properly charged indictment would allege a firearm, to wit, for example, destructive device or machinegun, and it would have some kind of definition that they're hanging their hat on as to which definition of destructive device, for example, is being alleged in the indictment, because the definitions run the course from a rifle over 50 caliber to a grenade or a bomb, or I mean, many diverse kinds of things are called destructive devices, so a properly worded indictment would have this information.</text>

            <text syncTime="3186.947" offset="12886164">In our view, fairly interpreted, Congress did intend the type of firearm used to commit the predicate offense here, the conspiracy to murder Federal agents under section 924(c), to be a sentencing factor for the court and not an offense element to be decided by the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="3217.883" offset="13009880">If the Court may please, I'd like to return to an earlier question by Justice Breyer about why, if firearm is an offense element, that the other types of firearms are not, or why wouldn't you argue that all of these are sentencing enhancements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.963" offset="13086158">I'd like to direct the Court's attention to the second sentence in the statute which refers to a second or subsequent conviction under this subsection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.319" offset="13123669">That was, of course, dealt with in the Deal case, so the second sentence calls the first sentence, refers to being convicted under the first sentence, and that's a statutory provision, and if you want to talk about legislative history, when in 1986 Congressman Volkmer introduced this statute he said that this imposes mandatory sentences for firearms including machineguns, so you get that term, mandatory sentencing, used a lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.402" offset="13239967">In fact, you even have that in '68, when Congressman Poff first introduced that amendment on the House floor for the 1968 legislation, so the fact that it's a mandatory sentence doesn't tell you anything about whether it's simply that the facts that gave rise to that sentence constitutes an element versus a mere sentencing enhancement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.518" offset="13332440">And if we look very briefly at the Almendarez-Torres situation, here we have something that is going to be in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.024" offset="13366504">It's not like it's prejudicial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.392" offset="13371937">The gun has to be in evidence, or there has to be evidence about the gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.694" offset="13393149">It's something that one would not say you want to avoid prejudice when possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.450" offset="13420107">It's got to be part of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.450" offset="13428153">It's something that's contested frequently, where the recidivism is not, and once again it's a traditional element of various offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.156" offset="13462948">Whether it be use of a firearm in a crime, or unregistered firearm, or carrying a concealed weapon, this goes back to common law and early State practice that types of firearms are offense elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.447" offset="13512162">So for all of these reasons we ask the Court to remand the case for resentencing in--</text>
