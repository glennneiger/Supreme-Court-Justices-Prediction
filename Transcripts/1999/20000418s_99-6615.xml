            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="84132">Opinions in two cases named Williams against Taylor are going to be announced today, the first one will be announced by Justice Kennedy.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="8.219" offset="116942">The Williams versus Taylor opinion that I am going to announce is 99-6615.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.913" offset="143691">The similarity in the names presents a coincidence that will do nothing but confuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.999" offset="180054">In this Williams versus Taylor, 99-6615, a Virginia jury convicted the petitioner Michael Wayne Williams of two capital murders, Williams received a death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.622" offset="230522">He later sought a writ of habeas corpus in Federal Court and requested an evidentiary hearing on certain constitutional claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.249" offset="257063">The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in agreement with the United States District Court, ruled that the petitioner was not entitled to a hearing on these claims in his federal habeas action.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.572" offset="302411">The petitioner’s execution was about to go forward and we issued a stay order on the evening of the punishment being carried out.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.481" offset="329996">We then granted certiorari to determine the correct statutory interpretation of the federal statute which controls the question of whether or not the petitioner may receive the hearing on his claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.188" offset="372837">The provision at issue is consist of one sentence in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.598" offset="398437">The sentece is the first sentence in 28 U.S.C. 2254(e)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="84.671" offset="422783">In effect, the sentence says that an evidentiary hearing, as a general rule, is not permitted in a federal habeas action, if the habeas applicant has failed to develop the factual basis of the claim in State Court, and the relevant phrase that we must concentrate upon is "has failed to develop the factual basis".</text>
            <text syncTime="106.239" offset="508988">In this case, the petitioner attempted to present to the United States District Court three claims that had not been a subject of the State Court evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.127" offset="540543">The Commonwealth of Virginia urges that whatever the reason for not developing the claims in the State Court, the fact is, there was no such development.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.319" offset="573353">In this sense, the Commonwealth argues the petitioner has failed to develop a factual basis for its constitutional arguments and as a consequence, the statute (according to the Commonwealth) bars an evidentiary hearing in Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.578" offset="630405">This is a no fault interpretation of the statute, we do not agree with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.083" offset="652452">We conclude that Congress used the word “fail” in the sense of saying that a person has not taken the necessary steps to develop his claims by reason of some omission or fault or negligence on his part.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.390" offset="701667">This is the sense we hold in which Congress has used the phrase “failed to develop the factual basis of the claim”.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.727" offset="726953">Now, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in this case, like every other Court of Appeals which has interpreted the statute, agreed with this interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.678" offset="758823">In our view, the Court of Appeals was not entirely correct however in how it applied the standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.097" offset="780452">We do agree with the Court of Appeals that the petitioner did not exercise the necessary diligence with reference to a claim regarding the prosecution’s alleged non-disclosure of his accomplice’s psychiatric report.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.045" offset="832279">As to petitioner's two other claims which involved allegations of juror bias and prosecutorial misconduct however.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.290" offset="857252">We disagree with the Court of Appeals application of the diligence standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.624" offset="874597">We hold that petitioner was diligent in his efforts to develop the facts underlying these two claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.449" offset="893928">The statute therefore erects no bar to an evidentiary hearing on these matters in United States District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.009" offset="916080">We remand the case for further proceedings and the opinion is unanimous.</text>
