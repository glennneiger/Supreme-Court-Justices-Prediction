            <text syncTime="2779.931" offset="11265134">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.126" offset="11301914">A law such as article 3807 that eliminates a requirement of victim corroboration does not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause because it does not expand the definition of the crime and does not increase the punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.235" offset="11358338">The label of substantive here that petitioner attempts to place on the law is not useful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.249" offset="11382371">It's really beside the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.241" offset="11386342">His emphasis on the fact that this defendant would have been entitled to an acquittal is not dispositive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.934" offset="11409121">In Collins, the Court overruled Kring v. Missouri, and that was exactly the situation in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.638" offset="11431899">A plea to a second degree murder conviction stood as a complete acquittal to a first degree murder prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.363" offset="11458858">And under the first rule in effect the defendant would have been able to go back and be acquitted of first degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.617" offset="11491876">Yet, that law was changed and originally the court in Kring held that that violated the ex post facto to apply it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2865.120" offset="11605875">Unfortunately, Justice Kennedy, this change in the law only went to one manner of obtaining a conviction here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.983" offset="11641297">It was only in cases in which victims testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.015" offset="11653418">The State of Texas could still prosecute people for... under the aggravated sexual assault through other evidence when victims didn't testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.613" offset="11687795">This just went to, I think as the Attorney General of Texas properly stated, a... the history of a lack of confidence in the credibility of these witnesses, and there were two ways in which sufficient credibility could have been introduced to permit admissibility for this testimony to go to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.616" offset="11763863">One was outcry and one was corroboration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.430" offset="11775148">And to look at both of those under State laws are very instructive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.040" offset="11789568">The outcry evidence, for example, if the child had told her mother within 6 months or a year, depending on which law applied, would come before the jury not for the truth of the matter asserted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.319" offset="11846619">It was excluded as hearsay for that purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="2931.776" offset="11872533">So, that has nothing to do with the sufficiency of the evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="3439.051" offset="13901620">Justice Souter, the point you were making is exactly the point that Fenwick's defenders made in the lodging that we filed yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.978" offset="13933281">And they made exactly the point that they viewed changing the minimum evidence as akin to changing the crime itself, as akin to changing the elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.694" offset="13976121">Justice Stevens, I think you're correct that this rule could be limited to crime-specific minimum standards of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.902" offset="14016977">Fenwick itself was a crime-specific treason minimum standard of evidence, and in the... in the Restatement Second, Conflicts of Law, minimum sufficiency of the evidence in the civil area... that's for a particular class of cases... is described as the clearest case where it's substantive, where... where it would be a more generalized rule in the civil context like, you know, a variation of how to say preponderance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.770" offset="14124497">That would not necessarily be substantive in that context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.102" offset="14141842">Justice Kennedy, the citations for requiring acquittal under Texas law are at page 19, note 10 of our reply brief, although I think the same would be required under the Lockhart case which is a Federal case, 488 U.S. 3340 to 42.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.847" offset="14236719">Also, Collins itself makes clear that whether a rule is substantive or procedural for purposes of the Ex Post Facto Clause is a Federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.434" offset="14275067">That's at page 45 of Collins.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.507" offset="14291367">Justice Scalia and Chief Justice Rehnquist, on this 20 years versus 1 year on category three, go back to Miller.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.405" offset="14326998">Miller was a case where the defendant could have gotten the exact, same sentence, and the change in the standard by which you decided what sentence to give was considered an ex post facto change.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.693" offset="14372138">This is a change in the standard by which you decide whether the defendant is guilty and I think would even more clearly fit within the Ex Post Facto Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.046" offset="14409545">Justice Ginsburg, I think Beazell is even stronger for us than the quotation you read.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.281" offset="14434518">Beazell also describes, as in law, different than the joint trial rule in Beazell, a law that would violate the Ex Post Facto Clause would be a change in a law concerning, quote, the quantum and kind of proof required to establish guilt and all questions which may be considered by the court and jury in determining guilt or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.875" offset="14512885">And that's quoted at pages 9 and 10 of our reply brief.</text>
