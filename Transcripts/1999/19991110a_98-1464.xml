            <text syncTime="13.150" offset="195957">We live in an age in which data bases of personal information are widely used in the national economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.326" offset="224692">They are bought and sold, and they're critical to national marketing, yet their dissemination threatens personal privacy and sometimes safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.879" offset="262831">The Driver's Privacy Protection Act is one of a series of laws in which Congress has balanced the benefits to commerce of disseminating personal information against the costs of that dissemination to personal security.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.452" offset="329182">Beginning with the Privacy Act and the Fair Credit Reporting Act in the early 1970's, up until the Financial Services Act that was enacted just last week, Congress has acted on a sector by sector basis as new uses of personal data and new threats emerge.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.706" offset="414132">In this case, Congress heard testimony that, while motor vehicle data bases are of particular value in commerce, their dissemination poses unique risks to personal safety and privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.857" offset="474736">Once disseminated, motor vehicle data bases are things in commerce, just as surely as are data bases that belong to financial institutions, cable operators, health care providers, and Congress may therefore regulate a State's discharge of data into the national economy just as it restricts a State discharge of pollutants or other State activities that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce, like operating airports, or issuing municipal bonds.</text>

            <text syncTime="290.523" offset="1305430">In our view, this is a case that is stronger for the Government than preemption, but the principle that when States act in interstate commerce, when they attempt to regulate an instrumentality or a thing in commerce, or they engage in an activity that substantially affects interstate commerce, Congress has the authority to direct or limit their activities just as it does with respect to anyone else.</text>

            <text syncTime="965.835" offset="4006700">First of all, the information that is being restricted here is not information about how the Government works, or how the Government structures its operations, the type of information that this Court was concerned with in Reporter's Committee, and that would pose a different problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.895" offset="4078903">But the second point I want to make is that the same point...  that is, well, you know, if the people of South Carolina want more protection for their privacy, they can vote, you know, they can elect, I don't know, a different Attorney...  they'd never find a better Attorney General...</text>
            <text syncTime="999.547" offset="4141492">but they could elect a different Attorney General, or they can move.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.409" offset="4152986">They could move to North Carolina, or some State that has a protection that's even stronger than the national legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.413" offset="4177019">But the same could be said with respect to the child labor laws, the surface mining laws that were at issue in Hodel...  the people of South Carolina are, of course, also citizens of the United States, and they have the right to call upon either Government for the protection of their liberties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.194" offset="4248072">That, after all, was the point I think that you made about the double protection of liberty in the compound republic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.699" offset="4274194">And what's particularly significant here is that Congress was asked, in testimony by the Association of State Motor Vehicle Operators, expressly to enact a law that, quote, must apply uniformly on a national basis because of the ubiquity of this information and the ease of accessing this information on computer modems from anywhere in the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.126" offset="4379833">The stalker who killed Rebecca Schaefer could just as easily have come from Nevada or Utah as from California, where she lived, and that's...  I'm not suggesting that when the States ask for something, that makes it constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.015" offset="4435422">In New York, this Court made it clear that if all 50 States agree with the Federal Government that it can do something that violates an independent prohibition of the Constitution, it still adds up to nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.761" offset="4478367">But with respect to legislation that Congress is empowered to enact, the fact that Congress was responding to the State motor vehicle administrators who were asking for a national uniform law, it seems to me does have some significance with respect to the exercise of Congress' authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="3281.813" offset="13270557">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.413" offset="13277035">I'd like to make three points in my 3 minutes, if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.894" offset="13286961">First of all, with respect to the Usery-Garcia point, Judge Easterbrook, writing the majority opinion in Travis, which is the companion case in the Seventh Circuit, found correctly, we think, and for the reasons we articulate in our reply brief at page 8, footnote 6, that this case, in any event, wouldn't be decided differently even under the regime in Usery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.442" offset="13389152">And I commend the Court's attention to Judge Easterbrook's majority opinion and our analysis, which essentially takes off from the Chief Justice's concurrence in South Carolina v. Baker, where the Chief Justice emphasized that the more expansive conception of the Tenth Amendment espoused in Usery recognized that congressional action that, quote, operates to displace the State's freedom to structure integral operations in areas of traditional Government functions runs afoul of the authority granted by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.403" offset="13532930">Justice Scalia's hypothetical, where there was a bar on releasing any information that is in a State record, probably would raise very serious concerns under Usery, but a release in commerce on information that is personal and private that is provided by citizens we think doesn't implicate Usery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.698" offset="13610148">With respect to the...  Justice Kennedy's point and Justice Stevens point about the category of one, I...  if one looks at the environmental laws, for example, that Congress has regulated sludge and solid waste systems that are operated, if not exclusively, overwhelmingly by municipalities, and Congress...  and it has regulated in a way that is different than it regulates other types of environmental issues, and the fact that Congress distinguishes...</text>

            <text syncTime="3421.906" offset="13830935">We have understood that in contrast to this Court's Eleventh Amendment jurisdiction, the Court has always construed its Tenth Amendment jurisdiction to include not only States but subordinate sovereign entities, or subordinate governmental entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.967" offset="13891226">I just want to point out, with respect to South Carolina v. Baker, which is always cited as a statute of general applicability, and perhaps in one sense correctly so, but only in the sense that this is, too, the section that...  the statute that was at issue in Baker, section 310(b)(1) of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act applied only to State and local governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.913" offset="13987043">It denied a tax exemption to unregistered bonds, a tax exemption that only applied to...  ever only applied to State and local governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.729" offset="14026227">The Court pointed out in its opinion that this was part of a general system of law, a general law that did away with...  it tried to address the problem of tax fraud through the use of unregistered bonds.</text>
