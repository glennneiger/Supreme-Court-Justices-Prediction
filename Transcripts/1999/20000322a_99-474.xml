            <text syncTime="14.058" offset="200135">The Massachusetts law challenged in this case is similar to the selective purchasing policies adopted by many States, cities, and private institutions in the 1980's regarding South Africa.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.733" offset="250812">Through the 1980's and 1990's, Congress addressed both South Africa and Burma, but took no action to expressly prohibit to the States or individuals the right to make choices about their vendors taking into account matters involving a foreign country.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.545" offset="326045">We think that Congress has not expressly denied to us the right to make this choice, because it believes, as we do, that these laws serve important national and local interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.735" offset="366796">There is a national interest in vigorous debate over important questions of foreign policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.372" offset="385395">There is a local interest as well, the interest in disassociating States and State tax funds from the indirect support of brutal regimes abroad.</text>

            <text syncTime="71.494" offset="429803">Mr. Barnico, would you take the same position if Massachusetts decided it didn't like another State's death penalty policy and wanted to discourage it and said, we're not going to let anybody spend State money to buy anything if the seller has anything to do with the other State?</text>

            <text syncTime="96.561" offset="530113">Not if the law regulated our citizens in that way, but if it were expending our own funds, as it is in this case, we would consider that to be proprietary as well under our definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.286" offset="581000">We quickly add that we don't think it would be a usual case at all, given the comity and respect each State ordinarily shows each other.</text>

            <text syncTime="125.313" offset="645157">It said that Wisconsin is not going to buy from anyone who has violated an NLRB order and they said, we're just expending our own money, and this Court said, you may be spending your own money but that's... what they said was, tantamount to regulation.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas A. Barnico</label>
            <text syncTime="144.424" offset="721539">Well, we think there, and the difference with Gould and this case, is the fact that the Court saw a nexus between the regulatory scheme imposed by Federal law and the State action that was at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.748" offset="770858">To give the Court an example of what might be closer to Gould than our case would be if Massachusetts had somehow tied its purchasing decisions to violation of the Federal ban on new investment in Burma.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.222" offset="820804">There, there might be more of a nexus between the regulatory scheme on the one hand... we think it was the close connection between the Wisconsin scheme on the one hand and the Federal complete scheme of regulation of the labor field that made the Court decide that we were regulatory in nature.</text>

            <text syncTime="232.996" offset="1075863">That really is the heart of our case, that absent the force of enacted law through the Supremacy Clause, such a choice by a State should not be displaced by the Foreign Commerce Clause or the dormant foreign affairs power.</text>

            <text syncTime="265.580" offset="1206162">At some point the differing policies becomes to the attention of Congress, and Congress, which has the preeminent voice in foreign affairs, would decide whether the national interest requires a rule of uniformity, but absent that action, or absent some question of a treaty, the States would be free to act indirectly in this way.</text>

            <text syncTime="304.307" offset="1361121">Well, if I might address both of those points, Your Honor, the first is on the question of the proliferation of these laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.627" offset="1390378">We have to keep in mind that we're acting against our own economic interest here.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.281" offset="1408977">Massachusetts is paying the price, bearing the burden to speak out on this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.601" offset="1434263">Since that's the case, our principle will be limiting, because it will limit those instances in which a State or local government which is to act against its own interest and act in the way that's challenged here.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.993" offset="1479821">Furthermore, Congress will be aware, presumably, in the event that a controversy arises due to the conflicting actions of the States as you mentioned, and it's also worth noting, finally, on the proliferation question, that even at high tide in the eighties with South Africa it was 20 States, approximately 100 cities, so I think the parade of horribles that's raised by the other side here about the numerous jurisdictions isn't realistic.</text>

            <text syncTime="424.067" offset="1840102">That is, the inference that the field has been occupied by the Federal action, that the Federal action here must be read in light of the experience of the 1980's.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.323" offset="1881166">Our point is that Congress knew well that State and local actions of this type were enacted throughout the country in the 1980's.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.528" offset="1913976">Then, when the question of sanctions against Burma arose in 1996, it acted against that backdrop.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.615" offset="1942293">It had tolerated these types of laws and, in fact, and we think this very interesting evidence, in 1993, when Congress repealed the sanctions against South Africa, it merely encouraged the States to act as to their own laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="2774.532" offset="11241989">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.054" offset="11284099">Chief Justice Rehnquist, I'd like to follow up on your suggestion and talk first about the Foreign Commerce Clause, because I think that what... the effect of what Massachusetts has done here in many ways exemplifies precisely what the Framers of the Constitution were trying to accommodate and to accomplish and avoid in enacting the Foreign Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.920" offset="11375527">The problem that the Framers were addressing was first and foremost the refusal by States in the Union under the Articles of Confederation to honor debts that they owed to British sympathizers and British citizens notwithstanding the treaty of 1783, and what Massachusetts has done here, and the purpose therefore in the clause, was to keep other States and the Union from being held accountable for decisions and unilateral actions for which they didn't have the responsibility, and what Massachusetts has done here is precisely the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.180" offset="11540621">The United States has had for a long time, at least since 1990, a policy with respect to Burma... and I want to emphasize here that this is a case about means, not goals with respect to the Burmese regime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.674" offset="11594538">We have had a policy that has emphasized in resolutions, in executive orders, in the Federal Burma Act, and in the President's 1997 executive order, the importance of a coordinated, multinational effort, because in the view of the national Government it's the only way we can have an effective voice with respect to Burma.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.670" offset="11682518">But Massachusetts, by choosing to extend sanctions to foreign companies, has created a considerable source of irritation with our trading partners and our allies, and has directly hampered our efforts to achieve multilateral action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.715" offset="11754721">Instead of our conversations with the EU and ASEAN and other countries that had been taking place about what to do about Burma, our conversations now are what to do about Massachusetts, and we have been treated to the spectacle of delegations of EU officials and other foreign officials writing to and visiting along with our trade representatives, Boston, Massachusetts in order to decide what the best means is to accomplish reform in Burma, and I think that that's just what the Framers were trying to avoid in enacting the Foreign Commerce Clause.</text>

I'm quoting now from many, many opinions of this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.277" offset="12144990">The test is, stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress, and I've pointed out one of three ways, and I will elucidate the other two, if I may, in which what Massachusetts has done has interfered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.488" offset="12213849">Now, Justice Scalia, your point, if I recall it, was that, well, that's fine, we were really concerned about it and we gave Congress the power to say, no, we don't like that, you can't do that, and I have... I think that's incorrect for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.248" offset="12276856">First of all, the Foreign Commerce Clause of its own force preempts State laws surely... and this Court has decided it many times... that discriminate on their face against a particular country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.376" offset="12349372">That was a principle that was elucidated as... by this Court as far back as Cooley v. Board of Wardens, where the Court pointed out that one of the main objects of the Constitution was, quote, preventing discriminations favorable or adverse to commerce with particular foreign nations that might be created by State laws, and I know that there is considerable uncertainty about the scope of the operation of what has been called the dormant Foreign Commerce Clause, but in essence the scope, the preemptive scope of the Commerce Clause itself, absent positive legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.584" offset="12506211">But there has never been a question from the start that... with respect to a law like this that singles out and punishes and sanctions commerce with a particular foreign country, that there is preemption by the Foreign Commerce Clause of its own force.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.895" offset="12579459">Now, secondly, it would be a regime that would be highly inimical both to the national Government and to our States and the Federal system to require Congress or the Federal executive to expressly keep track of and preempt each one of these actions, and I'd like to just explain--</text>

            <text syncTime="3161.994" offset="12791886">In fact, I mean, our position is that at least with respect to Burma, where there is one voice, and the voice has spoken, and the voice has spoken quite clearly with respect to means, it is preempted in any event, either by operation of the Foreign Commerce Clause or by the Federal action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.705" offset="12862730">But if I can just go to the point, Justice Scalia's point about what's so bad, what would be so bad about requiring the national Government to act, I would just say first of all, with respect to the national Government's ability to regulate foreign commerce and conduct foreign affairs, it is well-known that... first, that effective diplomacy often, probably usually requires that things be done and not be done publicly, and expressly, and the Austria example that I think Justice Breyer gave is, I think we are being treated to a vision of that point precisely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.859" offset="13003269">Secondly, as this Court recognized in Curtiss-Wright, and as the IEPA statute recognizes, fast action is required by the time... the problem may have festered and come to a head by the time the national Government can go through the processes necessary to preempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.840" offset="13079233">And I also would say with respect to Federalism and the comity that our system requires, that it is a wholly unnecessary irritant that would constantly come up in the context of our political system if, in the area of foreign affairs and foreign commerce, the national Government in order to pursue its... the objectives that the Constitution gives it, were required to single out, now, Massachusetts, we... you know, we preempt what you have done, and the Village of Takoma Park, we preempt what you have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.477" offset="13209741">The question was raised earlier about the South Africa sanctions which is, so far as we know, since the beginning of the Republic, the only instance, and not only the amicus brief citing the petitioner, but all of the scholarly articles that are cited in those briefs, we reviewed, and there are not instances of Governments acting in their procurement capacity to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.544" offset="13314022">But in the South Africa example, I think it's important to recognize first that in 1986... the South Africa case was decided by the Maryland Court of Appeals in 1989, and I believe it's the only decided case... that the... there was a congressional resolution, the national Congress, explicitly allowing States to do this, and there was a provision in the South Africa law that was passed that granted an exemption to States engaging, and localities engaging in procurement with Federal dollars from the general Federal rule that required that the lowest bidder, the lowest responsible bidder get it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.657" offset="13498446">So I think the South Africa example, to the extent that it consists of the only precedent that we have, is highly distinguishable, because here, in addition to the point I made about the frustration of the national Government's objective to pursue a multilateral strategy, the Massachusetts law is also inconsistent, and therefore frustrates the objectives of the Federal law in two other respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.442" offset="13609623">First of all, and the legislative debates about this couldn't be clearer, Congress considered much more stringent sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.648" offset="13646508">It considered precisely what Massachusetts has done, and it deliberately chose what it called a middle path, what Massachusetts... that is, not to prohibit precisely what Massachusetts has.</text>
