            <text syncTime="18.165" offset="216262">Federal bank larceny is a lesser included offense of Federal bank robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.320" offset="236847">Both offenses draw their language and history and understanding from centuries of common law under which larceny has always been understood to mean a lesser offense of robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.313" offset="292853">At common law, robbery was defined as an aggravated larceny or as a compound larceny, all of the elements of the larceny subsumed and embraced by the robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.167" offset="344262">The robbery... it was defined as an aggravated larceny because it had an extra element.</text>

            <text syncTime="54.417" offset="361294">I don't think the Government contests you on that point, Mr. McCauley.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.993" offset="375609">I think that what they rely on is a case like Bell against the United States, which says that the bank robbery statute was... was deliberately altered so as not to be a common law and... and its successor.</text>

            <text syncTime="71.674" offset="430258">I don't believe... the Prince case reveals that there was not an altering of the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.782" offset="454708">The Prince case I... I think is the precedent here regarding the understanding of the 1948 recodification and explains... there are two things I think the Prince case explained.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.074" offset="503923">It explained that the recodification in 1948 was a change in phraseology, a tidying up of the entire criminal code.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.975" offset="539449">It was not a rewriting and redefining of crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.864" offset="551048">And what's significant, it interpreted another provision within 2113, the unlawful entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.910" offset="583231">And it said... and it emphasized right in its opinion... it was manifestly the purpose of Congress to establish lesser offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.796" offset="614786">The Prince case said the heart of the offense is the intent to steal.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.154" offset="640178">It was... that language was emphasized.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.902" offset="651149">The intent to steal on the unlawful entry provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.074" offset="663897">Then the unlawful entry provision merges into the robbery provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.211" offset="680406">So, the robbery provision had to have an intent to steal.</text>

            <text syncTime="163.497" offset="797539">That long history and tradition is not going to be eviscerated or revolutionized if... or... I think the language in the Morissette opinion... if there was a mere deletion of a term.</text>

            <text syncTime="216.288" offset="1008713">There is a monetary element in the robbery provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.428" offset="1025327">You must take the money or the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.536" offset="1033686">The value is the universe of value... the universe of money, of which $1,000 is embraced.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.111" offset="1068063">So, that is not an element.</text>

            <text syncTime="236.937" offset="1091364">The reason I say it's not an element is I refer the Court to the Reviser's Notes and Congress in the Reviser's Notes, when it changed the threshold from $100 to $1,000, specifically stated that this change goes to punishment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3303.996" offset="13359616">We pointed this out in our brief at the cert stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.196" offset="13372364">We pointed it out in the Mosley case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.556" offset="13381768">The truth of the matter is, as a legal matter, this question hardly ever arises.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.506" offset="13409666">The last footnote of our brief points out that in virtually all cases where the defendant asks for this instruction, the facts do not justify the giving of the instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.547" offset="13457732">So, there is an academic quality to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.812" offset="13466822">We would concede that, but we did not bring the petition for a writ of certiorari here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.341" offset="13485004">And we are entitled to defend the judgment on an alternate ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.169" offset="13500259">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3346.448" offset="13529412">I just have some brief points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.056" offset="13535786">I do not believe the common law understandings of these two offenses is as malleable as my adversary says, and I... both sides have addressed all the citations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.490" offset="13577582">I just again point to the understanding of robbery as being defined and understood for centuries as an aggravated larceny.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.986" offset="13611541">Blackstone's specific words... they are the exact same understanding with all the elements of taking and carrying away.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.655" offset="13638186">They only differ by punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.826" offset="13646858">It's all there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.294" offset="13656785">They cannot say the common law is fuzzy about this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.839" offset="13674966">These two offenses have always been looked upon--</text>

            <text syncTime="3387.681" offset="13694297">Does the common law include any statutes?</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald J. McCauley</label>
            <text syncTime="3390.821" offset="13706835">--There were statutes based upon the common law, taking the common law terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.132" offset="13720106">The common law was an... an understanding and there were writings and case law publications explaining what the requirements were for the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.598" offset="13749990">They were codified in judicial opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.376" offset="13765141">I would also draw the Court's attention to a structure argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.031" offset="13783740">The structure of 2113 supports a finding that larceny is a lesser included offense of robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.575" offset="13809862">If you look to 2113(c), the receiving stolen property provision, which makes it a crime to receive stolen property and then points to 2113(b) as to how you punish that receiver of stolen property and you punish him equally the same as you would punish a larcenist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.536" offset="13893768">And we point out the anomaly of that at page 8 of our reply brief, that that would allow a receiver of stolen property from a bank robber to go unpunished if only the receiver of a stolen property can be punished as to (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.763" offset="13958656">But this mystery disappears if the understanding is 2113(b) is a lesser offense of (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.433" offset="13981330">So, receiving the proceeds of a bank robber as well as receiving the proceeds of a larcenist are punished.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.900" offset="14007139">And that structure, the congressional structure there, explains and gives meaning to this whole centuries... many, many centuries of the understanding that larceny is a lesser offense of robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.940" offset="14051338">Policy arguments cannot trump the text.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.018" offset="14063668">The Government points to what States are doing now, that robbery is bad, so we're going to make it easier to prove.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.750" offset="14090626">That cannot trump the congressional text here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.155" offset="14104210">And the change in phraseology is not a specific pronouncement by Congress that it's acting contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.980" offset="14139528">It's a mere deletion of a word, as was pointed out in Morissette.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.384" offset="14153111">And I believe Morissette understanding is that tradition... centuries of tradition and understanding and our whole criminal jurisprudence is not revolutionized by the mere deletion of one word.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.847" offset="14210999">And I submit that the mirror of the offense that's being interpreted, just as it was in Morissette, the offense of conversion that required a knowing element that was read in as a mens rea... it's always been the requisite element of intent to steal at robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.793" offset="14274738">And that's what it was from 1934 to 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.120" offset="14292083">And I think to square with the Prince holding, that the heart and the gravamen of the offense... and the Prince court said that the gravamen of the offense of robbery is the intent to steal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.147" offset="14332207">When you put the Prince case with Morissette, the only square reading is to imply the mens rea of a specific intent to steal, and there's nothing radical about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.784" offset="14378705">It's consistent with many, many centuries.</text>
