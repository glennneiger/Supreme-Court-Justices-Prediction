            <text syncTime="12.413" offset="197059">This case presents a question about the privilege against self-incrimination in the context of the compelled production of documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.165" offset="227988">Specifically, does the privilege extend not only to the compelled testimonial communications, the witness' admissions that the documents exist, that they're in his position... possession and that that they respond to the subpoena, but also to other voluntarily recorded information that is contained in the documents?</text>
            <text syncTime="38.185" offset="300086">Now, it's common ground that the contents of the documents were not privileged before the compulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.199" offset="324118">Although they would have been privileged under Boyd, your decision in Fisher rejected that view.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.903" offset="343031">The issue before the Court today then is whether the way in which the Government obtained those documents through a compelled act of production taints what otherwise would not be privileged.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.923" offset="387021">Now, respondent gives us a categorical answer that in any compelled testimonial admission of existence always automatically taints the contents of the produced documents.</text>

            <text syncTime="75.684" offset="450133">And the... the questions that were asked in the grand jury are the questions that we ask typically pursuant to the U.S. Attorney's manual.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.317" offset="476673">It's basically restating the things that are the implicit testimonial admissions that the Court identified in Fisher.</text>

            <text syncTime="99.895" offset="546995">Obviously, what I'm concerned with is if you have a witness before a grand jury for any length of period, some grand jury would say, oh, he looks shifty or he's not looking me in the eye, all the things jurors think about.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.809" offset="586597">And... and it seems to me there is a high degree of risk involved when you have a subpoena of this scope and of this sort, a risk of incriminating the person... person through his testimony.</text>

            <text syncTime="123.938" offset="643126">Well, I think that that's true, but I think that in this particular case and I think in most cases where you have a production of documents, you have to distinguish between the things that the witness is forced to say, implicitly or explicitly... and in this case, I think those things were much the same... and the contents of the documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.307" offset="712611">And in this case... and I think in many cases... we don't have to use and we didn't use in any way any of the things that he said.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.115" offset="743854">I mean, all we're using is the information that was in the documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.144" offset="759945">I think the... the key for us to this case is that it's not relevant that we got the documents from respondent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1190.789" offset="4910489">Second, the subpoena also compels the witness to make certain implicit testimonial admissions about that the responsive documents exist, that they are in his possession, and that the production to the Government will transfer the documents to the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="1438.395" offset="5900948">I realize the Court has said that, but the only meaningful statement that a respondent can make is that responsive documents exist, which is a way of correlating what the subpoena calls for with what the documents actually say.</text>

            <text syncTime="3243.847" offset="13122760">So that even in the case of the foregone conclusion, there is some testimonial aspect, and I suppose it's a testimonial aspect to which the... the later use of the... of the document can... can be traced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.028" offset="13187439">And yet, under the foregone conclusion doctrine, we say, well, it can be used anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.692" offset="13210113">The reason I guess is not that there is no conceivable use of testimony, but that because of the foregone conclusion, it's understood that the Government could get it anyway by a different means, e.g., a Fourth Amendment search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.537" offset="13285555">Am I right that it's kind a... a harmlessness analysis?</text>
