            <text syncTime="62.055" offset="393626">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="64.506" offset="403448">The district court in this case, after two trials, found that Laidlaw had violated the Clean Water Act 1,412 times.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.962" offset="441274">One hundred and thirty of those times had come in the immediate 6 months before the complaint was filed, and another 36 of the violations came after the complaint was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.651" offset="480039">The complaint alleged ongoing violations and it sought injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.972" offset="501251">Five years... three... five years later, after the complaint had been filed, the district court found that there was no long... that Laidlaw was in substantial compliance and therefore there was no need at that point to issue injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.898" offset="564990">Instead, it imposed a penalty of $405,000, specifically to deter future violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.403" offset="594978">Six years after the suit was filed, the Fourth Circuit held, solely because injunctive relief was no longer in the case, that the case had to be dismissed as moot, and that attorney's fees would not be payable to the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.680" offset="652134">We submit that Article III does not compel such a perverse result.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.651" offset="671987">The plaintiffs submit that, even though the civil penalty is payable to the United States Treasury, that plaintiffs benefited from the imposition of a penalty because penalties deter future violations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1085.015" offset="4485447">The court of appeals erred in holding that a citizen's suit under the Clean Water Act must be dismissed as moot if the district court concludes that injunctive relief is unwarranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.823" offset="4528705">The Clean Water Act authorizes private citizens to bring suit to abate ongoing violations, and it provides the district courts with two types of coercive remedies to compel compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.111" offset="4573845">The district court may ask for civil penalties, or it may grant civil penalties, or it may issue an injunction, and that choice lies with the discretion, the remedial discretion, of the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.569" offset="4619716">The district court properly exercised its discretion in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.390" offset="4634972">The citizens brought suit to abate ongoing violations, and the court determined that they were entitled to relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.727" offset="4660363">The court declined to enter an injunction in light of Laidlaw's current compliance status at the time of judgment, but it nevertheless concluded that civil penalties were appropriate, because they would deter future violations by Laidlaw at that site.</text>

            <text syncTime="3543.774" offset="14320549">Well, Your Honor... Your Honor happens to have hit on one of the central grounds of our appeal to the court of appeals, which was that we take the position that the economic benefit has to be stripped from the violator without taking into account attorney's fees, particularly since the attorney's fees could not be known to the district court at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.087" offset="14397767">I think that was a mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.270" offset="14402469">But the point that I'm making here is, because that issue is... clearly is not before Your Honors, the point that I'm making to Your Honors is that the district court clearly found that the penalty it was imposing was a deterrent against future violations, that is, specific deterrence, and I submit that it is a concrete benefit to the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.415" offset="14483030">I want to come back to the question about whether... whether, if you deny injunctive relief, then you can't grant civil penalties, that injunctive relief is not a lesser form of relief, and I think that is very clearly shown in Romero-Barcelo.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.459" offset="14555233">There, this Court said that injunctive relief should not lie under the facts of that case under the Clean Water Act, but it then pointed out, although it did not faithfully anticipate this Court's later ruling in Department of Energy v. The State of Ohio about sovereign immunity, but it then pointed out that penalties were an alternative to injunctive relief, and I submit to Your Honors that is exactly what we have in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.866" offset="14688875">What the district court found was that there was... that there was not enough likelihood of violations to justify the extraordinary relief of injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.757" offset="14736418">It said that the defendant did not need to show no chance of violations in order to defeat injunctive relief under the ordinary four-part test for injunctions, but it then quite clearly said, when it got to civil penalties, that that was a deterrent, and it would stand in place of injunctive relief.</text>
