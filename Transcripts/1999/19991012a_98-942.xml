            <text syncTime="17.878" offset="216842">In case after case, our judges follow the law and apply the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.263" offset="238367">When there is a mistake or a miscarriage, there is a necessary corrective, as there was in the case of Mr. Scarpone, my client's co-defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.202" offset="274102">Like his co-defendant, Mr. Fiore was and is factually and legally innocent of a crime which has only two elements and is plainly understood from the reading of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.177" offset="322063">Those elements are operating a waste disposal facility and doing it without first having a license.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="50.683" offset="348081">Well, Mr. Lieber, I suppose that the highest court of Pennsylvania has determined that at the time he committed the offense, it was an offense and that they later interpreted the statute, but didn't give it retroactive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.494" offset="419343">Is that what they've done?</text>

            <text syncTime="69.760" offset="424359">Respectfully, I'd have to disagree, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.612" offset="439719">What the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania did was deny a writ for allowance of appeal on the same basis that this Court denies a writ for certiorari.</text>

            <text syncTime="90.758" offset="508369">However, no inference can be drawn from their failure to take jurisdiction under king's bench powers, which is an emergency writ, or from not hearing the case in a certiorari-like situation that mirrors your very rules.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <text syncTime="109.035" offset="581511">The fact is your client has been convicted, finally convicted, by the Pennsylvania State courts of being guilty of this crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="123.379" offset="638876">However, Mr. Justice Scalia, the problem with that is that the Pennsylvania courts did not apply the law of the Pennsylvania statute which, as this Court held in Rivers v. Roadway Express and recently in the Bousley case, is... is from the time of an action what the highest court of... of the State says it is.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="148.179" offset="738037">Mr. Lieber, in light of what you've just said and in Justice... in light of Justice O'Connor's question, would your position be different if the Pennsylvania Supreme Court had, indeed, held that the law was as the lower courts thought it was; that is, even if you had a permit, if you flagrantly violated it, it was as though you had none?</text>
            <text syncTime="171.212" offset="830197">Suppose that was the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's precedent and then in Scarpone's case, the Supreme Court overruled that precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.234" offset="866246">Would your position be different than it is today?</text>

            <text syncTime="183.602" offset="879725">--Only in one situation, Justice Ginsburg, and that would be in the situation, as in Wainwright v. Stone, where the judicial application to the statute over a long period gave consistent notice to our citizens that their conduct would violate... would be violative of the statute in keeping with judicial construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.366" offset="962795">Now, in Wainwright, there were 50 years of judicial construction to alert those individuals that their conduct was in fact proscribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.353" offset="994769">This was the... the Fiore ruling was, in fact, a first ruling under the statute and it was a... a judicial misconstruction of the first order.</text>

            <text syncTime="224.512" offset="1043356">Well, if you... if... if Mr. Fiore had been convicted like, say, 5 years ago under the statute and 5 years later a new case arose with the same kind of facts and was decided as Scarpone's case was decided, would you be here making the same argument?</text>

            <text syncTime="1768.762" offset="7220375">But all the court said in Shaffer was, as Your Honor recognized, Justice Stevens, in Bousley, that the law is what we say it was from the beginning, but then they say in Kuchinic, which is cited in Ettinger... and the Kuchinic cite is 222 Atlantic 2nd 897, a Pennsylvania Supreme Court case from 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.112" offset="7305743">It says that the latest decision is applicable to a case... and this applies even if they changed, as one of the hypotheticals was, where they said the statute meant one thing in one opinion and then changed their mind years later.</text>

            <text syncTime="1904.385" offset="7762886">You're absolutely correct, Mr. Chief Justice, and they said that at least twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.837" offset="7776679">They said there was a conflict between the... what the superior court did in petitioner's case and what Commonwealth court did in Scarpone's case, and they were concerned that my office, the office of Attorney General of the Commonwealth, which brings these prosecutions, wouldn't know how to work, wouldn't know what to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.864" offset="7844806">And that gets to a point that was made earlier, Your Honor, as to the precedential effect of the memorandum opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.220" offset="7874168">It doesn't have broad precedential effect, but the... the IOP is cited... the internal operating procedure of the superior court to which counsel references, and it specifically says that there's an exception as far as the precedential value in a criminal case where the case is important as to issues of res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.949" offset="7949087">In this particular case, that was critically important because it went to the first issue that the superior court and the trial court in the post-conviction proceedings discussed, and that was that this statutory construction, sufficiency of the evidence, Jackson claim, if you will, had been decided against Fiore in his original appeal and that they would not under State procedural law, under our post-conviction relief act... would not allow the re-litigation of a claim that had already been litigated on direct appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="3457.769" offset="13976372">In that time, Your Honor, I'd just like to make a couple of points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.405" offset="13990896">First of all, this Court has consistently said that the distortion of the meaning of a statute is not a rule, and for purposes of retroactive... retroactivity analysis, if that's what we're in, you need a new rule and an old rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.718" offset="14064143">There was no old rule here under Pennsylvania law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.253" offset="14078354">There was no foreshadowing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.836" offset="14084623">The foreshadowing quite clearly was to Scarpone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.038" offset="14097475">The regulations taught everyone in Pennsylvania in this industry what it meant to have a license and what it meant to have one revoked.</text>

            <text syncTime="3495.644" offset="14127882">Mr. Lieber, does it cut in either direction that Fiore did try to get the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to focus on his case, what, four times and every time they just denied... they denied review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.619" offset="14179813">Does that count one way or another?</text>

            <text syncTime="3512.189" offset="14194024">Your Honor, I would submit that... that if it counts at all, it counts very slightly and only to the extent that there... it shows the necessity for habeas review in a Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.097" offset="14245747">But it shows nothing about the merits or the judgment of the merits by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court because they are a certiorari-like court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3533.369" offset="14278765">Well, if he hadn't even tried to put it to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, perhaps there would have been some question about exhaustion or waiver, but he did try a number of times.</text>

            <text syncTime="3547.946" offset="14337071">But it does suggest a view of the Pennsylvania court that it doesn't apply its new decisions to cases that have become final.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.603" offset="14387748">It won't apply them on collateral review at the State level.</text>
