            <text syncTime="614.275" offset="2607142">One of the strands of reasoning in Doyle was that the defendant's post Miranda silence was...  I think it was ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.337" offset="2651341">I forget what adjective was...  insolubly ambiguous, I think was the phrase that the court used.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.601" offset="2680389">Don't we have an insoluble ambiguity problem in the predicate for the comment in issue here, because to the extent that the testimony of the defendant is, in fact, congruent with that of other witnesses save at some, you know, crucial exculpatory point, we don't know, and I presume in the absence of some affirmative evidence going to the truth or falsity of particular statements, there's no way for a jury to know whether in fact that congruence is the result of truth or the result of tailoring.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.492" offset="2816017">So that if a comment like this, let alone an instruction on this point, is given in the absence of some affirmative reason in the evidence to think that there was particular tailoring on a particular point, it sounds to me as though the ambiguity, as in Doyle, would simply give the jury kind of a wild card.</text>

            <text syncTime="720.280" offset="3031161">It was referred to in footnote 10 that the prosecutor implied guilt, and it was dealt with more specifically in the dissenting opinion that the prosecutor asked the jury, or suggested to the jury that the testimony, or that inconsistency was inconsistent with innocence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1305.688" offset="5372777">I know when I practiced, long ago, the defense attorney, criminal defense attorneys were split on the question of whether it was an advantage to the defendant to have the judge charge that he was not required to take the stand and they weren't to hold it against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.778" offset="5441114">That was certainly the constitutional law, but it also called the jury's attention to the fact that the defendant hadn't taken the stand, and maybe made it worse.</text>
