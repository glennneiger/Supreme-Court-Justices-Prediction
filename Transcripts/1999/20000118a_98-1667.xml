            <text syncTime="17.371" offset="202373">This case involves a claim for overpayment of income tax for the calendar year 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.460" offset="234765">There is no question of the overpayment.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.019" offset="245005">It occurred and is acknowledged.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.262" offset="250021">The taxpayer's claim was filed June 1, 1993 on Mr. Baral's income tax return which was filed late.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.437" offset="294638">Nevertheless, there is no dispute that the claim of overpayment was timely for code section 6511(a) purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.212" offset="341763">The question of a limitations bar to recovery arises under code section 6511(b), which provides that only payment of tax sought to be refunded, made within 3 years before the claim, may be recovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.531" offset="435072">It's 3 years plus any extension of time granted to file a return.</text>

            <text syncTime="85.746" offset="475928">If the starting date for limitations... if the starting date for limitations is April 15, 1989, the payments could not be recovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.030" offset="565057">The starting date is June 1, 1993.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.049" offset="581149">The statute of limitations does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.714" offset="591807">The limitations period under section 6511(b) starts running from the date of payment of the income tax, not from the date that income tax liability arose or accrued.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.787" offset="652097">In the Government's view and that of the court of appeals below, the payment of income tax was made April 15, 1989, the income tax return due date, although on that date, the amount of income tax liability had not been determined and was not known by anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.700" offset="751781">The Government and the court below assert that section 6513(b)... (b)(1) and (2)... makes the return due date the starting date for limitations, quote, as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.763" offset="832029">In other words, they assert that deemed due date of the return was the date of payment of the income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.212" offset="861808">In our view this is a misreading of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.825" offset="880199">The statute provides that the... the deemed date, the date of the return being due, is the date to which withholding taxes and estimated taxes are brought forward instead of their actual payment dates which occurred during the calendar year.</text>

            <text syncTime="241.320" offset="1098269">In our principal brief, it's at page A-12, appendix page 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.231" offset="1121883">That says, any amount paid as estimated income tax for any taxable year... I repeat estimated income tax... shall be deemed to have been paid on the last day prescribed for filing the return under section 6012 for such taxable year, determined without regard to any extension.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.463" offset="1222821">The deemed date is the date of payment of the estimated tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.983" offset="1236822">Now, the court in considering this, at least those courts that have been adverse to our position, have without any focus simply assumed that the deemed date of payment of the estimated tax is the deemed date for payment of the income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.326" offset="1318220">And those are two totally different things.</text>

            <text syncTime="315.963" offset="1396796">Why would the Congress want to draw a distinction?</text>
            <text syncTime="319.922" offset="1412679">What is the significance of deeming a date for the payment of the estimated tax other than to establish the date of payment of the tax itself?</text>

            <text syncTime="328.756" offset="1447996">There... if I may say so, Justice Stevens, the statute which originally brought this into the code, the 1943 tax act, made the point that the deemed date was the deemed date, but not earlier than the deemed date.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.070" offset="1525214">In other words, that phrase appeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.976" offset="1532842">It got dropped in the '54 code.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.884" offset="1540470">But the significance I think is that you have cases not unusual at all, where taxpayers file a return early between December 31 and the due date of the return, and the... that... that filing of a return and bringing across the credits for withholding and estimated taxes against the income tax would start the statute of limitations running before the return date.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.935" offset="1676724">It also would start interest running before the return date.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.976" offset="1692816">And I think the real function was to limit the application of the statute to not earlier than a return filed on the due date--</text>

            <text syncTime="419.953" offset="1812770">And the caption of 6513(b) is prepaid income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.784" offset="1844117">So, at least the caption, although it may not have the force of law, at least the caption, prepaid income tax, and the word shall seem to tug against the position you're taking.</text>

            <text syncTime="441.349" offset="1898347">As to the caption, first, I think that is a... a secondary or tertiary form of reading the... the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.508" offset="1938994">I think the words of the statute itself are of more consequence.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.680" offset="1955712">But the word prepaid income tax can also be viewed as a synonym for advanced payment of income tax, in other words, can refer to a credit situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="501.832" offset="2140241">I regret, Your Honor... Mr. Chief Justice, that I don't think it is in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.624" offset="2159467">But that has two subsections, one of which deals with late return filing.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.173" offset="2189665">It says, interest shall not be paid until the return is filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.943" offset="2204711">Then it has another subsection entitled advanced payments, withholding taxes, and estimated taxes, and that, in effect, deals with early payments and says interest won't be paid until the due date at the earliest.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.504" offset="2266987">In effect, it repeats what was said pretty much in the '43 act.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.505" offset="2290915">Now, one reason why we've referred to the '43 act is the Government has cited that act, I think without any great effect, as controlling with respect to the purpose for which this was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.275" offset="2357998">Incidentally, I may say, in response to Justice Ginsburg's comments, that the Habig case, which we have cited in the brief... that's 390 U.S. at page 225... deals with section 6513(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="576.923" offset="2440649">The sections immediately involved here are 6513(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="582.218" offset="2461861">But that also has a deemed due date as the date for the presumable starting point of the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.003" offset="2512956">And in that case, the Court makes it very clear that that is designed for the purposes which I ascribed to 6513(b), namely not to start the statute before the return due date, not to start interest payments before the due date.</text>

            <text syncTime="633.049" offset="2665093">We... we cited that case primarily for the point that impossibility may override the application of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.815" offset="2700202">In that case, there was a criminal case and a statute of limitations of 6 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.565" offset="2727160">And the question was, did the statute start on the return due date or the actual filing of the return?</text>
            <text syncTime="655.637" offset="2755477">And the Court held it had to be the actual filing because the offense was to be found in the return filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.690" offset="2783689">How could you have a statute of limitations running before the offense occurred?</text>
            <text syncTime="668.919" offset="2808662">Similarly, in our situation, our position basically is, how can you have the payment of a tax when nobody knows what it is?</text>
            <text syncTime="677.348" offset="2842308">And I might remind the Court that long ago this Court held that to be the governing principle here.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.952" offset="2872714">That's... that's the Rosenman case, and the Rosenman case is very central to your consideration, I think, of this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.594" offset="2899359">The Rosenman case was very close to this case in many respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.722" offset="2915869">There the taxpayer, a month or so before he filed a return, sent in a letter saying that he was paying an estimated tax, which is involved here as well, for the purpose of avoiding penalties and interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.643" offset="2983474">And the Court said at the time he remitted the estimate of estate tax there, he couldn't be paying the estate tax because nobody knew what the estate tax was at that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1256.626" offset="5159474">And so, one might say given that they didn't think they owed it, it wasn't the payment of an estimated tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="2537.822" offset="10284280">What Rosenman dealt with was something entirely different, an administrative practice that Congress has repudiated and that no longer applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.358" offset="10318344">In Rosenman, before the case arose, the Service had long taken the position that a remittance of tax from a taxpayer who in fact owed no liability would not be treated as a payment of tax but would be held in a suspense account on which no interest would accrue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.619" offset="10387412">The reason the Service had done this back in the '20's and '30's was because of a concern they had about a potential abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.936" offset="10412698">The potential abuse related to the fact that overpayment interest is more than the interest on ordinary Federal funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.899" offset="10440492">Right now it's 3 percent over the short-term Federal funds rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.575" offset="10455225">The Service didn't want the Treasury to be used as a bank that would allow taxpayers to simply... in the words of the Congress that discussed this, to simply throw the money at the Service and go... and collect this higher rate of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.998" offset="10504963">So, to prevent the abuse, the Service had a prophylactic approach of saying all of these payments from taxpayers who don't owe us anything we're going to put in a suspense account.</text>

            <text syncTime="2755.841" offset="11156352">It was treated as a payment on which overpayment interest would accrue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.003" offset="11172966">And, indeed, the strange argument the United States made in the Rosenman case was that the legislative determination that that was to be treated as a payment for purposes of overpayment interest somehow resolved an uncertainty that had existed in the past about whether those kinds of payments would be held as suspense or as payments for purposes of the limitations provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.396" offset="11266484">Well, the Court, to be blunt, would have none of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.615" offset="11283412">In the Rosenman case, the Court said it will not do to treat these funds as a payment or not as a payment depending on whether the Government wins or loses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.793" offset="11328133">And because the Government treated... at the time of the Rosenman case arose treated it as a deposit and not as a payment, that's... that's the way it should be treated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.590" offset="11367317">Now, after Rosenman, after the new section 4(d) of the Current Tax Payment Act, those types of remittances are not held in special suspense accounts, are not held in deposits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.473" offset="11410785">The only way we accept a deposit now is under the revenue procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.097" offset="11425309">And under the revenue procedure, it is generally required that the taxpayer specifically designate at the time of the remittance that he is making a deposit and not a payment, and that protects everybody and everybody knows what's happening.</text>

            <text syncTime="2889.214" offset="11689772">And there may be one explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.676" offset="11695624">Congress has provided that a payment of a tax made after the notice of deficiency has been issued and the... and the Tax Court case has begun that if you pay it after you've begun the Tax Court case, then you don't divest the court of jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2959.838" offset="11972313">In paragraph 4.04 of the revenue procedure, if a taxpayer makes a remittance at a time when there's no identified liability and we don't know how to apply it... he doesn't designate the year or the tax to which the remittance would apply... we will temporarily treat it as a deposit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.039" offset="12045142">We will promptly notify the taxpayer of this and request him to tell us how he wants us to designate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.198" offset="12069697">And so, in that one brief instance, there can be a deposit without an express designation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.364" offset="12090386">There is a... a broad point that I want to mention, and that is if petitioner's argument were accepted, it would seriously disadvantage the vast majority of taxpayers who pay timely, who file timely returns, and who file timely claims for refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.703" offset="12171784">And that is because on petitioner's theory, payments of estimated taxes, of withholding, payments made with... with the return, and any payment made before the tax is assessed would simply be a deposit and would not be a payment on which overpayment interest would run.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.419" offset="12246599">Since under the code, the Service can take 3 years after the return is filed to make an assessment, petitioner's theory would mean that these taxpayers would lose their overpayment interest for that 3-year period.</text>
