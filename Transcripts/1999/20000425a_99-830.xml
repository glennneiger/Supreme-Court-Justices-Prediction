            <text syncTime="25.959" offset="247667">With that legal principle, and the Casey undue burden test in mind, the issue here today is whether a State may prohibit a little-used form of abortion that borders on infanticide when safe, alternative forms of abortion remain available to women who seek abortions.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.859" offset="319243">Clearly, the State can constitutionally ban some abortion procedures.</text>

            <text syncTime="214.728" offset="1002815">That is precisely the point, Your Honor, and that is precisely what motivated the legislature of the State of Nebraska in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.210" offset="1028729">In fact, the State interest here was so strong that the statute passed the Nebraska legislature with only one dissenting vote, with many pro-choice State legislators voting in favor of this ban on partial birth abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.391" offset="1093408">Now, the respondent argues that drawing a bright line between abortion and infanticide is not a valid State interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.622" offset="1122351">The respondent argues that there are only two valid State interests, one being maternal health and the other essentially discouraging abortions.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.963" offset="1163729">However, Casey specifically recognized that other State interests could be weighed as part of the undue burden test, and at 505 U.S. 877 the Court said, quote, a statute which, while furthering this interest in potential life or some other valid State interest, and then goes on to describe the substantial obstacle test, so the Court recognized that there could be other State interests besides merely maternal health and discouraging abortions.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.699" offset="1286609">Now, the respondent next argues that even if there is a valid State interest, that it can only be asserted if it creates no burden on a woman's right to have an abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.227" offset="1328719">The respondent implicitly asks this Court to adopt a no-burden test, or perhaps reestablish a strict scrutiny test in place of Casey.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.473" offset="1369783">The respondent argues that, under the no-burden test that any State regulation which increases the health risk to a woman by even the slightest amount is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.500" offset="1413878">This is contrary to Casey, which held... which upheld the 24-hour waiting period because it did not create, quote, a real health risk, unquote, or a, quote, a significant threat, unquote, to the health of a woman.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.353" offset="1473228">The respondent also asks this Court to in effect adopt an all-or-nothing test in place of the large fraction test to judge the facial constitutionality of abortion restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.348" offset="1525264">In other words, the respondent argues that unless a statute is constitutional in every conceivable application, it must be struck down as facially unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="1641.349" offset="6709212">The Nebraska statute before this Court aims to eliminate the two central principles of Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.720" offset="6746724">It seeks to reverse the supremacy of women's health over fetal interests throughout pregnancy, and it seeks to replace the viability line established in this Court's jurisprudence with a new line, one based on the location of the fetus inside the woman's body.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.791" offset="6819031">I want to focus on three main reasons that the Nebraska ban is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.242" offset="6844840">First, it's so broadly written that it could prohibit most second trimester abortions as they are performed in Nebraska today.</text>

            <text syncTime="2553.424" offset="10357578">Well, first, the district court found that a prohibition on the D&amp;X technique would impose appreciable risks on women, and that follows from the very common sense findings of the district court that the D&amp;X technique reduces instrumentation in the uterus and reduces, therefore, the risk of uterine perforation and infection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.042" offset="10436049">But even if the risks were less than appreciable, anytime a State prohibits a safe abortion technique, it is prohibiting a technique that will be the safest for some women.</text>

            <text syncTime="2843.122" offset="11516369">But to say that an abortion procedure that is safest for the woman, a pre-viability abortion procedure, is so horrific and so like infanticide, any of the... any of the abortion procedures... that could be said about any abortion procedure because every abortion procedure pre-viability involves fetal demise.</text>

            <text syncTime="2899.130" offset="11740396">And that is the recognition in Casey that a statute which has the purpose of imposing an undue burden on the woman's right to obtain a pre-viability abortion is also invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.218" offset="11800686">Here the only purpose suggested, indeed, the primary purpose identified by the Attorney General of Nebraska, is precisely to elevate the status of the fetus based on its location within the woman's body, not in its location once it's born, not on viability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.710" offset="11874665">And this is an interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.646" offset="11878427">If this elevation were permitted, it would authorize States to prohibit all abortions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.255" offset="11900892">That's an impermissible purpose under Casey.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.082" offset="11912177">Coupled with this impermissible effect of effectively depriving women in Nebraska of the safest and most medically appropriate method of second trimester abortion, the statute simply can't survive under this Court's decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.449" offset="11989604">Indeed, when you... when you consider the State interests there... some of the other State interests that are proposed, not even they are served by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.411" offset="12037460">The interest in, for example, cruelty to the fetus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.878" offset="12059403">There's no evidence that that interest is served here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.580" offset="12070165">In fact, the statute doesn't say anything about cruelty to the fetus at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.423" offset="12085525">So, we're looking at a statute that doesn't serve either of the recognized State interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.233" offset="12104751">It doesn't... there's no evidence that it serves any of the proposed new State interests by permissible means, and at the same time, it imposes some health risks on women.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.572" offset="12158146">That sort of statute... the balancing in that sort of statute is decisively against the constitutionality of the statute under any interpretation, whether broad or narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.582" offset="12206211">For example, again, if... if the State... if the State couldn't really prohibit a more dangerous procedure for abortions such as hysterotomy because those methods are most medically appropriate for some women.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.106" offset="12284265">And to take one method like the D&amp;X technique out of the hands of physicians performing pre-viability abortions inevitably makes abortion more dangerous for women.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.523" offset="12333898">So, when this Court, for example, in Danforth struck down the... Missouri's prohibition on saline abortions, it took a step that enabled physicians to continue to develop newer, safer methods of abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.250" offset="12400876">That really relates to one of the points made by Mr. Stenberg in his opening, which is that, well, why aren't all these other physicians around the country doing this if it's so safe?</text>
