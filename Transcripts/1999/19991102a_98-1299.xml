            <text syncTime="237.190" offset="1099213">You don't have any express language in the IAD regarding waiver.</text>

            <text syncTime="1739.860" offset="7109988">The provisions of the statute, Article III(e), requires an inmate who's invoking the statute to sign a document agreeing to go back to that sending State as soon as the receiving State is finished.</text>

            <text syncTime="1811.496" offset="7396499">All those reasons are...  are reflected in a statute that says, fine, we'll give you our guy, but you have to send him back to us quickly, and there are strict time requirements to be strictly enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.437" offset="7440281">And Congress went a step further.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.045" offset="7446654">They enacted a very limited tolling provision, a tolling provision based on good cause as opposed to the tolling provision in numerous other statutes saying time periods could toll on either a good cause or consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.759" offset="7497541">The determination to not include the or consent language here I think is important because what's being argued by the petitioner is that consent is a per se basis for giving up those rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.193" offset="7543308">But if time periods are...  can, in fact, be per se lost by consent, there would not be a need for that language elsewhere.</text>

            <text syncTime="3057.521" offset="12380558">What's left here is in a situation where the petitioner has chosen not to rely on the statute, is seeking...  is seeking to rely on waiver analysis, and it's our position that waiver analysis, with respect to the IAD, exists and occur...  and...  and must exist in a limited fashion in order to ensure that not only the interests of Mr. Hill and other defendants are met, but also the interests of the...  of the two States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.215" offset="12475330">The interests of not only...  I've discussed the sending State, but the interests of the receiving State are not always adequately represented by trial prosecutors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.017" offset="12506573">That's reflected in speedy trial statutes that allow for dismissal, even when there's no objection by defendants, as a means to ensure that the prosecutors know that they have a burden of compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.763" offset="12561534">This statute puts a burden of compliance on...  on a State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.107" offset="12574909">The only burden the statute puts on the defendant, in this case Mr. Hill, was to invoke the statute, which he did in writing, the document in writing, actually had a form for...  for the defendant to sign.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.767" offset="12613570">There's no place for...  for counsel to sign.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.874" offset="12622034">He invoked that statute in writing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.376" offset="12627990">He...  at that point as the statute is written, puts the burden of compliance solely on the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.388" offset="12652023">The State apparently neglected its burden and chooses not to rely on statutory language, but instead is hoping that the...  that this Court were to adopt a waiver analysis which has no limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.200" offset="12695281">The reason I say that it has no limits, it's not clear from the petitioner is he's saying is consent the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.023" offset="12718583">What constitutes consent?</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.592" offset="12724852">Is it concurrence?</text>

            <text syncTime="3146.360" offset="12735928">I would suggest an easy test which assures that the goals of the IAD are met as a test adopted by New York State which is if there was not a defense requested or initiated continuance, then consider whether the...  the continuance that was granted was a good cause showing continuance which would justify extending the statutory time periods.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.172" offset="12815236">By doing that, by keeping the statute...  statutory waiver provisions narrow, what we do is achieve the goal of assuring the public interests of both sending States receiving...  and receiving States are met.</text>

            <text syncTime="3184.831" offset="12889841">If I could perhaps clear up a couple of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.432" offset="12900186">Waiver of a Federal law or a Federal right is a Federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.852" offset="12917949">The IAD is a Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.642" offset="12925054">We need uniform interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.417" offset="12932160">That's why this Court, in fact, has taken some previous cases to resolve particular issues of interpretation of the IAD instead of letting 50 different States have their own interpretations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.400" offset="12968104">Whether there are State procedural rules in terms of appellate practice and whether issues can be raised, that deals with forfeiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.838" offset="12993809">That's a separate issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.664" offset="12997152">That has nothing to do with what the scope is of waiver of the IAD as a Federal standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.289" offset="13015647">With respect to the questions about what if Ohio has a charge, I just wanted to suggest one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.695" offset="13037277">If in fact the sending State also has criminal charges pending, as I suggested before, it might be a matter of comity between the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.632" offset="13065071">If the defendant initiated this procedure and wanted to go back to New York, and Ohio insisted that they wanted to try them there, I think very clearly there is a provision under the IAD which says the time is tolled whenever a defendant is unable to stand trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.757" offset="13117525">And that could very easily be invoked based on some sort of agreement between the States because even though he's invoked it here, Ohio wants to take precedence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.354" offset="13147931">They'll just delay until that's done in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.416" offset="13156186">So, that can be invoked right under the IAD.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.002" offset="13162455">That's not a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.812" offset="13165694">As far as the sending State's interest in this prisoner and about, well, Ohio wanted this individual back as soon as possible, the statute itself requires it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.016" offset="13202579">As soon as the proceedings are terminated in the receiving State, he has to go back to the sending State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.020" offset="13218566">So, this wasn't a matter of Ohio contacting New York regularly and say, we want this guy, we want this guy, you know, when you going to be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.881" offset="13241972">He just goes back automatically.</text>

            <text syncTime="3275.854" offset="13253884">I notice in the joint appendix there are a series of forms that are Form III, Form VI, and Form so forth that are prepared under the agreement, the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.679" offset="13293172">Is there...  is there a form that's been prepared to deal with the situation we have before us in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.797" offset="13313652">See, one of the...  I think the strongest argument against your position is that if you had a form, you always get the lawyer to sign the form, you won't have this argument again about whether there's a waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.745" offset="13353463">But I guess there isn't a form...</text>

            <text syncTime="3302.314" offset="13359732">Well, because what happens is the prisoner is always in another State when he activates these proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.938" offset="13378227">He just...  he's given a choice and he wants to tell the sending State that...  or the receiving State that he wants to face these charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.685" offset="13397244">That's all done while he's in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.171" offset="13403200">Once he comes back into the other State, the receiving State, then it starts like a regular criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.372" offset="13423993">And I think in response to one of the other questions about counsel, I don't believe there's any bar to the State assigning counsel in the receiving State if he wants to consult with the defendant about whether he wants to initiate this process or whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.229" offset="13467461">His rights can be protected if...  if necessary or if the court wants to.</text>

            <text syncTime="3347.534" offset="13540604">Well, you've got the distinction between when he's in prison and when he's starting the process and then what happens sometime later once he's been transferred to the other State and now he's into the process of the criminal prosecution in that State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.177" offset="13579161">The sending State, to the extent it has an interest in rehabilitation, let's not forget that rehabilitation starts with the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.895" offset="13610090">So, it's not just the interest of the sending State in saying, we want to get this prisoner back here to rehabilitate him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.742" offset="13629420">It's got to be dependent on what that prisoner's state of mind is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.903" offset="13642063">That's what the whole focus of this IAD is, and that's why it gives the prisoner the right, if he wants to, to decide I'm not going to stay in prison, I'm going to go back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.218" offset="13667350">It gives him the choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.499" offset="13672470">And I would submit that in terms of this public policy, the proof is in the pudding in the sense that the IAD has been with us now for some 40 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.634" offset="13705071">The courts have uniformly held these rights waivable, and there has been no indication by the States, no outcry, that somehow this is impeding the sending State's interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.151" offset="13751151">There has been no rush to drop out of the IAD, and in fact, over the years, despite this waivability principle, States have continued to join to the point where now every one but two States are party to this agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.842" offset="13793887">And again, just for clarification, we're not talking about a right to waiver.</text>
