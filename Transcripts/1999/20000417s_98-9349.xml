            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="84324">I have the opinion of the Court to announce in No. 98-9349, Steven Dewayne Bond versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.009" offset="120268">Petitioner Bond was a passenger on a Greyhound bus that left California bound for Little Rock, Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.361" offset="149735">A Border Patrol agent boarded the bus at a place called Sierra Blanca, Texas which is about 80 miles southeast of El Paso on Interstate 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.782" offset="199367">After the agent had checked the immigration status of the passengers he began squeezing the soft luggage in the overhead bins.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.514" offset="230296">When he squeezed petitioner’s canvas bag, he noticed a “brick-like” object.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.795" offset="251403">After obtaining petitioner’s consent to open the bag, the agent discovered a brick of methamphetamine.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.253" offset="277317">The brick had been wrapped in duct tape until it was oval-shaped and then wrapped in a pair of pants.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.102" offset="300722">Petitioner was indicted for conspiracy to possess, and possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.336" offset="325591">He moved to suppress the drugs, arguing that the Border Patrol agent had conducted an illegal search of his bag.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.898" offset="351818">The District Court denied the motion petitioner was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.211" offset="365088">The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.793" offset="375433">In an opinion filed today, with the Clerk of Court, we reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.792" offset="391420">It is undisputed that petitioner had a protected privacy interest in his carry-on bag.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.341" offset="413676">The government argues that by exposing the bag to public handling petitioner lost a reasonable expectation that it would not be physically manipulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.849" offset="451710">The government relies on our cases that hold that matters open to public observation are not protected by the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.144" offset="484833">But those cases involved visual as opposed to tactile observation and thus do not require the result in favor of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.933" offset="524017">Our traditional Fourth Amendment analysis embraces two questions: first, we ask whether the individual has sought to preserve something as private.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.292" offset="561424">Here petitioner sought to preserve privacy by using an opaque bag and by placing that bag directly above his seat.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.219" offset="593189">Second, we ask whether an individual’s expectation of privacy is one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.026" offset="624327">When a bus passenger places a bag in an overhead bin, he expects that other passengers or bus employees may move it for one reason or another, but he does not expect that his bag will be physically manipulated in an exploratory manner and that’s exactly what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.382" offset="693813">We therefore hold that the agent’s conduct violated the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.528" offset="710427">Justice Breyer has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Scalia joins.</text>
