            <label>Justice Clarence Thomas</label>
            <text syncTime="15.963" offset="148061">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.112" offset="172616">Petitioner Sims brought a claim for Social Security benefits based on certain alleged disabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.788" offset="203336">An administrative law judge denied her claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.831" offset="219532">She requested review by the Social Security Appeals Council, which declined to review her claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.493" offset="250148">Sims then brought suit in Federal District Court in Mississippi, arguing that the administrative law ludge had erred in three ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.398" offset="289749">The District Court ruled against Sims and the Fifth Circuit affirmed the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.951" offset="307931">In so doing, the Fifth Circuit refused to consider two of the three issues Sims had raised before the District Court, because she had not mentioned them in her request for review that she submitted to the Appeals Council.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.869" offset="367594">We granted certiorari to determine whether petitioner waived the issues that she did not exhaust by not including them in her request for review.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.431" offset="421929">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we reverse the judgment of the Fifth Circuit and remand for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.306" offset="453380">No statute or Social Security regulation requires issue exhaustion and the request for review by the council.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.639" offset="494758">The Social Security Commissioner therefore urges us to impose such a requirement as a matter of judicial policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.857" offset="527568">When we have done this previously, it was because the administrative proceeding at issue was adversarial, and thus it was the responsibility of the parties rather than the agency to develop the issues before the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.583" offset="586500">This reason does not apply to the Appeals Council, which is inquisitorial rather than adversarial.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.308" offset="613354">The applicable regulations make clear that the Council does not depend on the claimant to develop the issues for review.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.412" offset="641776">As a result, it makes little sense to require issue exhaustion in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.948" offset="663927">Justice Oâ€™Connor has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment; Justice Breyer has filed a dissenting opinion in which Chief Justice, Justice Scalia and Justice Kennedy have joined.</text>
