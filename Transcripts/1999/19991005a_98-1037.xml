            <text syncTime="8.428" offset="175885">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="28.690" offset="256969">This case concerns one of the hardy perennials of American law, what to do with a meritless criminal appeal when that appeal is brought by an appointed lawyer on behalf of an indigent client, and what the standard of reversal in such cases should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.183" offset="330948">This Court addressed the problem in Anders v. California, holding that the indigent appellant in that case had his equal protection and due process rights to counsel on appeal violated by California's conclusory no-merit letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.253" offset="391238">Anders has two component parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.046" offset="406389">The first is the identification of the constitutional rights at stake, and the second is the setting forth of a procedure by which those rights can be vindicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.462" offset="448081">The Ninth Circuit thinks that the Anders framework, the second part, is compulsory.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.036" offset="470337">We think not.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.788" offset="477338">In fact, we believe that the Ninth Circuit's insistence on rigid, programmatic adherence to that procedure has undermined California's legitimate efforts to provide effective assistance to indigent appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.827" offset="541495">The second issue is whether the Strickland test for ineffective assistance should apply to meritless indigent appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.992" offset="578170">Federal habeas is intended to guard against extreme malfunctions in the State procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.247" offset="603143">Ordinarily, Federal courts presume the regularity of State court judgments, but not in no-merit cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.172" offset="634908">In those cases, prejudice is presumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.526" offset="652254">This is presents problems, because it is altogether too one-sided, and because it turns the presumption of regularity on its head.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.642" offset="688721">A presumption of prejudice should be reserved for cases where the error is so systemic that it's impossible to judge what the harm is, and the examples given generally are those of judicial bias and actual denial of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.975" offset="770118">We urge that Strickland be adopted to bring this one anomalous situation into conformity with other cases where deficient performance by counsel is urged.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="168.122" offset="814631">Ms. Jorstad, the problem that I have with that is not a theoretical problem, but kind of a practical one, and that is this, that if we require a demonstration of Strickland prejudice at the habeas stage, once there's been found to be an Anders violation, if we require the demonstration of Strickland prejudice at that stage, as a practical matter, what we are going to do is require the argument of the appeal in the first instance in a Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.540" offset="916299">And number 1, that's going to take some serious time, and the oddity...  when you get to standing on head argument, the oddity is that you're going to have your appeal argued in the first instance in a Federal court, whereas in the first instance it shouldn't be, so for pragmatic reasons it seems to me that there's an argument that it makes a lot of sense to say that once you have shown the Anders violation, and let's say, to go...  I'd go this far for the sake of argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.852" offset="1049628">Once you've shown that there's a possibility that there could be a difference, that there might be some merit, that's as much as you should require, or in effect you're going to turn Federal courts in habeas cases on Anders into State appellate courts.</text>

            <label>Ms. Carol F. Jorstad</label>
            <text syncTime="243.554" offset="1116397">Justice Souter, I believe that that's not an overall concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.480" offset="1148058">I think if we look at this in the context of merits briefs, where counsel raises one or two or three issues, but fails to raise one or two or three others, the Federal courts are in much the same position.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.092" offset="1206572">They're going to have to look...  in a Strickland context, there is no presumption of prejudice, but in a Strickland context they're going to have to look at these other issues that will be asserted on Federal habeas, and of course, they should have been exhausted in State court as well, so it won't be the first time.</text>

            <text syncTime="281.132" offset="1266758">Ms. Jorstad, doesn't the strength of your second argument on the prejudice and so forth from Strickland depend to a certain extent on whether we agree with you that the constitutional rights for the appellants discussed in Anders do not require that the particular Anders remedy be etched in stone, that other remedies would be equally effective?</text>
            <text syncTime="311.362" offset="1387653">Isn't that going to influence somewhat the outcome of the Strickland analysis in the second prong?</text>

            <text syncTime="320.138" offset="1422761">Yes, it is, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.851" offset="1429553">Our position on this matter is that the first component of Anders, that is, the rights to be vindicated, is strictly constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.830" offset="1473543">It goes to effective or ineffective assistance, and can always be raised in Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.845" offset="1493606">The second part of Anders, this prophylactic framework, is not constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.068" offset="1522445">This is a matter of pragmatic suggestion by the court in Anders, and we believe that these rights can be vindicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.325" offset="1555463">After all, what we're talking about is effective assistance of counsel, we're talking about equal protection, and to a lesser extent, due process, and the laboratory of the States should be allowed to develop these procedures in ways that make sense in those States, as long as they vindicate the underlying rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="372.980" offset="1634144">Do you believe as a general proposition that, if this Court identifies a constitutional violation, and says the way this violation is to be avoided in the future is to follow steps A, B, and C, that any court, State or Federal for that matter, is free to say, well, we really don't like A, B, and C, we'll try C, D, and F?</text>
            <text syncTime="399.206" offset="1739052">Do you believe that the lower courts are free, when we have come up with a pragmatic constitutional solution and says, this is the way it is to be avoided, are they free to ignore that?</text>

            <text syncTime="534.272" offset="2279264">California took Anders very seriously, and so...  and People v. Feggans followed it very, very closely, but over time, things changed, and what has happened in the last 32 years and even less, really, is that California's system for providing representation to indigents has become more and more sophisticated, has become more established.</text>

            <text syncTime="646.085" offset="2726481">When the lawyer has decided that there's no merit to the brief, and when his appellate supervisor, his Appellate Project supervisor, who's an expert, concurs, he may file a brief under California procedure in which he sets forth a detailed statement of the case and statement of the facts with citations to the record which help the court to know that the record has been read and considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.772" offset="2817282">In the record, in the brief filed in this particular case, counsel mentioned in his statement of the case that there had been a Faretta motion, that the appellant's competency had been tested, and that there had been two so-called Marsden motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.893" offset="2881752">In California they're for replacement of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.075" offset="2894500">So those issues were kind of identified in the statement of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.608" offset="2908606">In addition, you're correct in saying, Justice O'Connor, that he does not withdraw, and he asks the court...  he also does not, pursuant to the Wende case, argue against his client.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.137" offset="2958761">What he does is to ask the court to make an independent review.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.639" offset="2972763">This allows the court to look at the record without having a list of issues that counsel has read, researched, and rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.907" offset="3013828">The idea here is to have the court take a fresh look, and that is in fact the holding of Wende, is that an independent review by the court is required.</text>

            <text syncTime="1126.496" offset="4648152">As far as the discipline of writing down why the issue is no good, I think if we try to step back a little and look at what's the basis for requiring that might be, we're talking here about the right to counsel, and we're talking about mostly equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.829" offset="4729550">If you analyze this as a matter of equal protection, it would simply never be true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.064" offset="4754419">I can say categorically that retained counsel would have to explain to the court why he failed to raise the issues he doesn't raise, nor would appointed counsel, who raises...  you know, even if counsel in a merits brief raises a single extremely marginal issue, that counsel would never have to say to the court, here are the other issues I considered, and here are the cases that say why they're no good.</text>

            <text syncTime="1182.122" offset="4870716">What I'm suggesting is that we do have...  Justice Ginsburg, you said, trust me, and I think we should afford similar trust to lawyers who write no-merit briefs that we give to lawyers who write merits briefs, and specifically I would point out that under the current system it takes a lot of courage to write a no-merit brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.298" offset="4951382">Now, first of all, I would also add that it's not as if the lawyer who presents a no-merit brief can just kind of write it off and hand it in and go away with his money.</text>

            <text syncTime="1296.544" offset="5328381">Now, Penson I think would have come out the same way if there had been a Strickland test as a presumption of prejudice, but it's very, very different, because in Penson the, really the largest fault was the court's, and that is in failing to appoint counsel once they knew that the first counsel had missed big, arguable issues.</text>

            <text syncTime="1663.933" offset="6797926">First, both the district court and the Ninth Circuit correctly found that there were arguable issues in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.716" offset="6821018">therefore, like the defendant in Penson, Robbins had a right under Douglas v. California to an advocate's brief on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.331" offset="6851529">Second, Robbins' State appellate attorney did not file a proper Anders brief in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1686.578" offset="6888518">There was no advocacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.341" offset="6895519">A nonlawyer could have written the brief or document which was filed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.572" offset="6912446">As the Warden concedes, it does not refer to a single legal issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="1697.507" offset="6932195">Well, Mr. Nessim, supposing that under a State which follows the Anders rules, an Anders brief is filed, but...  and the State...  the Federal court finds that there was some issue that should have been raised, what does the Federal court...  can the Federal court examine that on habeas, and if it does find an issue should have been raised, what is the remedy?</text>

            <text syncTime="1722.814" offset="7033446">I believe the remedy should be prejudice per se, Your Honor, because the Federal court will not be guided by the advocacy process, would not be able...  does not have the information, would have to speculate, as this Court has repeatedly found, to make that determination without an advocate's presentation, if there's a finding of an arguable issue that a merits brief is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.489" offset="7116097">If there's no finding...  if...  the Federal court may not be in a position to decide if there's an arguable issue with an inadequate merits brief or an Anders brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.416" offset="7151832">If there's no adequate brief that refers to the issues, the court only has the cold record, and this Court has repeatedly found that that is insufficient for the court to make its determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="1764.405" offset="7199793">I mean, here the lawyer in the State court on appeal filed a no-merits brief under Anders, and you say the Federal district court, it doesn't have to decide that there actually was any error in the State court proceedings, but only that there was an arguable issue, and then what, it goes back to the State court to have another argument on an arguable issue, without ever finding any constitutional infirmity in the trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1799.471" offset="7340123">It requires the lawyer to act as an advocate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.425" offset="7351930">The Federal habeas court is unable to make the determination whether the appeal is wholly frivolous, which is constitutionally required, without the assistance of an advocate and, as I think a question was asked during the Warden's presentation, it's efficient to have the State court make the determination in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.796" offset="7429357">The Federal court's determination was, was there a denial to right to counsel, and this Court has repeatedly found a right to counsel on the first appeal as of right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.454" offset="7464048">In fact, Pennsylvania v. Findley assumes that while Anders may not be mandatory in the case of post conviction or discretionary appeals, it is mandatory where there is such a underlying constitutional right.</text>

            <text syncTime="1844.466" offset="7520055">I'd be awfully worried about...  I agree with the Chief Justice that, suppose...  what you're saying is, if lawyer A, who's a good lawyer, perfectly good, it's not inadequate assistance, brings an appeal and leaves out issue 1 in the State court and argues the rest of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1864.821" offset="7601452">It's waived, unless it was inadequate assistance of counsel, which I assume it wasn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.445" offset="7619947">You're saying lawyer A did exactly the same thing, but not having found any other issues, he files an Anders brief, which in every other respect is fine, and under those circumstances we have two more procedures, 1) the procedure in habeas court where the habeas judge says, I guess it's arguable, you should have raised it, and then back we go to State court, and this time it wasn't waived.</text>

            <text syncTime="1903.699" offset="7756933">In most cases it will be a merits brief, but if the lawyer is unable to do that because of ethical reasons, it requires an Anders brief, and in Penson this Court distinguished the situation between where a lawyer acts as an advocate but acts ineffectively, in which case there's not a presumed prejudice standard, and the situation where there is no advocate at all, and we would submit there was no advocate at all here, because a proper Anders brief was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.407" offset="7859855">In fact, of the nine issues that we refer to in our brief, not one of those are even hinted at.</text>

            <text syncTime="1958.300" offset="7975421">So to decide for you might require me to decide for a system that's actually going to give the criminal defendant a less-good shot at the appeal, and that's worrying me, so I want to know your response to that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1972.669" offset="8032890">Your Honor, the aspect of Anders which was criticized in California is the aspect of the independent judicial review, which is independently required by California law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.159" offset="8078866">The Wende case that's in fact one of the two issues they face, they interpret Anders as requiring that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.074" offset="8098510">We would submit to you that the California system, while certain aspects of it are good, and there's no reason that they can't stay under what we promote, they can still have this appellate project system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.459" offset="8139992">I would add that most of the facts concerning that system are not in the record of this case, which was pointed out in one of the amicus files, but more importantly...  and I think this is crystal clear...  while this case should be decided under Federal constitutional law, the Warden has mischaracterized the California system, and I would refer you to In re Sade C, an opinion of the California supreme court, which does not purport to break any new ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.595" offset="8236541">It just refers the precedents which were in effect, and it says that Wende...  and I'm referring to page 787 of actually the 55 Cal. Rptr. 2d version, but Wende made clear that in such a situation all the steps specified by Anders had to be taken, other than those dependent on filing a motion to withdraw.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.298" offset="8319401">The implicit rationale is that for present purposes substantial withdrawal is equivalent to formal withdrawal, and in the footnote there it says that the Oregon court erred in finding that an Anders brief which referred to issues was not required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.620" offset="8376662">So our position is, first of all Federal constitutional law controls, but there is no contrary California system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.364" offset="8407695">If this Court looks at footnote 8 and footnote 22 of Sade C, which does not purport to break new ground, it just refers to California law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.060" offset="8442386">Footnote 22 says very clearly that the brief that was filed in that case, if Anders was to apply...  the court concluded that Anders did not apply in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.105" offset="8478644">It deals with a custody situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.097" offset="8486585">But they said that we note that under Anders none of the briefs submitted by appointed appellant counsel would have been sufficient.</text>

            <text syncTime="2661.596" offset="10788600">It is addressed in great length in one of the amicus briefs that was filed on our behalf, the one on behalf of Delgado.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.920" offset="10817857">Our position on the CAP system is, first of all it's not in the record and shouldn't be considered, but if the Court does consider it, as the Daskian brief points out, there are five different appellate projects in California, and one of them in 1990, after the Ninth Circuit decision in Griffy, where the courts basically said, the Ninth Circuit in that case, if the California system is as they claim, meaning not requiring an Anders brief, it's unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.399" offset="10935826">According to this brief, one of the appellate projects at that time switched to the Anders system and according to this brief two others have, but I would caution the Court, none of this is in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.145" offset="10982742">Our position is that even if...  1) it's not in the record, and 2), even if there was a second attorney who reviewed it, this Court has repeatedly held that is not the substitute of an advocate's brief, and an Anders brief, while a very strange form of advocacy, is still an advocate's brief, and the court needs that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.908" offset="11053795">I would point out also that there is a fundamental difference between the Warden's position and our position as to what an arguable issue is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.695" offset="11100920">The Warden I think would ask counsel to speculate as to, in a sense act as amicus per aes, which was criticized before as to the likely success of an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.603" offset="11148567">I think in McCoy this Court very clearly said that an arguable issue is any issue that has any basis in fact or law, and I think the nine issues that we set forth, and we only need one...  and the lower courts didn't say that there were not more than two.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.755" offset="11205201">They said there were at least two.</text>

            <text syncTime="3084.401" offset="12479767">They argued there there was a multi-tiered review of several attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.464" offset="12496068">They argued there that there was an independent judicial review of the whole record, and this Court found that insufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.140" offset="12522712">Why, and again I go back to the purposes, because the Court...  the cold record is not enough for the court to make the determination of whether the appeal is wholly frivolous, nor was it enough to determine whether counsel provided effective assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.167" offset="12570882">The brief here only...  a high school student could have written this brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.959" offset="12590004">It first of all misses most of the important pretrial proceedings, and even its summary of the facts, it's a nonlawyer's discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.887" offset="12625739">It's a summary of a witness-by-witness basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.160" offset="12634830">There's no advocate's basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.690" offset="12640995">I should add here that the failure of advocacy goes beyond, in this case, the mere file...  the failure to file an advocate's brief, whether merits or Anders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.957" offset="12677984">The Chief Justice in his dissent in Penson discussed that there's no reason to doubt that the attorney conscientiously reviewed the record in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.903" offset="12717795">There's plenty of reason to doubt that in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.866" offset="12729602">Many of the important pretrial proceedings weren't even transcribed at the time, so the attorney didn't have the benefit of that, the appellate court didn't have the benefit of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.303" offset="12775369">In fact...  and then Penson discusses that one of the important responsibilities of an advocate is to ensure that the appellate court has a full record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.309" offset="12811418">The appellate attorney here failed in that obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.441" offset="12823957">Robbins actually made several motions to augment the record before the State court of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.446" offset="12847989">The attorney did not support those efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.116" offset="12858647">In fact, many key portions, the...  one of the arguable issues we raise is the denial of the motion to...  for destruction of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.373" offset="12895637">The Warden points out in their reply brief that Robbins said at one point, this motion has already been heard, and the judge says, well, we're not going to hear it again.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.908" offset="12929805">In fact, if you look at the record, there's nothing in the record to suggest that it actually was heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.783" offset="12949344">Robbins was probably confused.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.594" offset="12956554">The hearings, which...  between the filing of that motion and that colloquy, if you look at the minute order, that's all we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.019" offset="12982259">None of them indicate that the motion was actually heard, and so Robbins actually pointed to each of these key motions and hearings in his motions to augment, and the appellate court denied that, and I think that was probably in contravention of California law to look at the whole record.</text>

            <text syncTime="3329.201" offset="13458941">In fact, in both...  Ebbitts refers to Anders and Entsminger, cases where the attorneys did not formally withdraw, and notes that they were represented by counsel in name only and, in fact, they had no counsel at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.049" offset="13514425">Like those defendants, Robbins in this case had to shift entirely for himself, and Penson refers to both Cronic and Saterwaite v. Texas as cases which obviously involve trial error.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.050" offset="13574402">But that...  Penson expressly extends them to the appellate area and says, when an attorney fails to act as an advocate in a proceeding, the error pervades the entire proceeding and can never be harmless, and the reason for that is because the court would have to speculate without the assistance of an advocate, and we've also discussed the additional reasons of comity and judicial efficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.127" offset="13674712">I would add that we believe that even if the Strickland standard was applied in this case, that we would prevail.</text>

            <text syncTime="3409.358" offset="13779620">I think we should be very clear about what advocacy means in the context of an Anders brief, or a no-merit brief generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.651" offset="13812743">Up front, it means, giving the client the benefit of professional judgment, of professional skill, professional analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.938" offset="13849942">In California, there's also even more professional review, and a whole system built around that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.463" offset="13876064">But once there's been a no-merit determination made by counsel, when you talk about advocacy, what you're really talking about is advocating for the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.349" offset="13915561">Telling the court what issues it can readily reject cannot help having some, at least subliminal, if not more, effect on the mind set of the judges who are reading that brief.</text>
