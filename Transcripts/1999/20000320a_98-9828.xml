            <text syncTime="38.705" offset="289873">The Ninth Circuit has articulated this rule, although it has relied on no specific language in the Federal Rules of Evidence or the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.956" offset="322892">Indeed, the Solicitor General appears to concede that there is no such specific language supporting such a rule.</text>

            <label>Mr. Benjamin L. Coleman</label>
            <text syncTime="57.240" offset="364061">We rely on the 1990 amendment to Rule 609, which specifically removed the cross examination limitation with respect to when evidence could be admitted under Rule 609.</text>

            <text syncTime="77.216" offset="443891">We believe it supports our position because we do not think that Congress would have intended to lay a trap for the unwary to on the one hand specifically authorize attempts to mitigate the sting, but on the other hand silently provide for the fact that such attempts, which are authorized, constitute waivers of the right to appeal without making any such indication in the rules of evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="106.486" offset="561024">I mean, what you have here is a criminal defendant who introduces this matter in the trial herself.</text>

            <text syncTime="115.759" offset="598118">With respect to the first part of the question, I believe that usually the waiver rules are incorporated in the Federal rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.325" offset="624345">For example, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 12 has a specific provision which indicates when a party specifically waives any objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.003" offset="655065">With respect to, how can a defendant actually introduce the evidence and yet seek to appeal it, she is only introducing the evidence after she has articulated an objection, that objection has been overruled, and the only possible reason why she would be admitting that evidence is because the objection is overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.020" offset="719117">No criminal defendant in their right mind would seek to put in evidence of a prior conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.396" offset="736672">That's extremely damaging evidence, and nobody would ever seek to do that.</text>

            <text syncTime="326.924" offset="1442814">I believe that Luce indicates that when a defendant does not testify, an appellate court cannot determine for sure whether a prosecutor would have used the prior conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.856" offset="1486491">However, when the defendant does testify, an appellate court can review the full and complete record, which includes the defendant's testimony, and make a determination as to whether the Government's case was so strong that it never would have used the conviction.</text>

            <text syncTime="371.001" offset="1619088">Couldn't he have confirmed the in limine ruling by asking just before the testimony, Government, are you going to bring this up, and then there would have been no doubt about the definitiveness of the ruling, or the Government's expectation of bringing it out on cross?</text>

            <text syncTime="408.156" offset="1767673">In fact, on the day that the defendant testified, the district court specifically warned defense counsel that obviously the prior conviction was admissible, so in these particular circumstances, I do not think that such a scenario was required.</text>

            <text syncTime="472.250" offset="2024091">They simply can take the position that, given the nonwaiver rule, it's simply in their interest to have the decision made, in effect, at the last possible moment when, in fact, the judge knows as much as the judge can possibly know in weighing the relative probity versus prejudice, and it's in the Government's interest in effect to avoid appeal risks.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.777" offset="2142164">So I don't think the Government necessarily would have to act in bad faith simply to say, we're not going to make the final decision and we're not going to make a representation.</text>
