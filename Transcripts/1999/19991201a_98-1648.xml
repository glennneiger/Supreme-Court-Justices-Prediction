            <text syncTime="12.108" offset="194882">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.561" offset="208674">The Fifth Circuit held that the constitutionality of government provision of educational resources pursuant to neutral statutes depends upon the medium in which the resources are provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.430" offset="260188">That is to say, that if it's provided in the form of a textbook or in the form of a public employee providing remedial education services, it is constitutional, but if the...  but if similar material is provided in the form of computer-assisted instruction or library books, it is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.171" offset="327166">I'd like to make two principal points this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.062" offset="338660">The first is that the distinctions of this sort have not...  are pedagogically meaningless and counterproductive and have no relation to the principles of the First Amendment, and secondly, that the criteria laid down by this Court in its decision in Agostini v. Felton, 2 years ago, provide a principal basis for resolution of issues of this sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.995" offset="422461">The statute at issue here, Chapter 2, was originally enacted in 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.260" offset="447538">It provides for grants to local education agencies through state education agencies for the purchase of educational materials and equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.666" offset="489125">Today, that means principally, in the case of non-public schools, library books, computers, computer software, and an equal per-capita sum per student is provided to the local education agency for all students, no matter what accredited school they attend.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.070" offset="558715">These materials...  then the statute provides that the LEA will then purchase secular, neutral, and non-ideological materials and equipment which will then provide for the use of the students at the schools where they attend.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.178" offset="615140">The Fifth Circuit held that...  as I said, that the computer-assisted instructional equipment and the textbooks are unconstitutional, relying upon this Court's decisions in the mid...  late 1970's, Meek v. Pittenger and Wolman v. Walter.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.240" offset="687447">It is our submission that that is an erroneous decision and that, under the criteria in Agostini v. Felton, this program is entirely constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.575" offset="728720">Indeed, we don't consider that this case is even particularly difficult because the statute was designed in a particularly careful way providing safeguards that, if anything, go beyond any constitutional requirement...</text>

            <text syncTime="179.070" offset="862781">I think that the principle under which those cases was decided has already been explicitly rejected by this Court in Agostini.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.384" offset="892038">The judgment in those cases could be sustained because, if you read the opinions carefully, you will see that the Court presumed in those cases that the statutes were not neutral; that is, it analyzed the cases as if what they were looking at were entirely grants to non-public schools which were disproportionately...</text>

Mr. Lewis who was head of the program in the State of Louisiana, he explained one of the problems was that there was such a major turnover of the people that were in charge of the Chapter II program of the sectarian schools that many times those that were in charge of the program weren't really fully instructed and didn't know.</text>

            <text syncTime="3483.025" offset="14078545">Essentially, what this case is about is bringing programs of this sort up...  up to date, that the Meek and Wolman, the cases upon which the Fifth Circuit relied and the Respondents are mired in the technology of the 1970's and the jurisprudence of the 1970's...  since that time, education has changed and this Court's doctrines have changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.809" offset="14169661">There may very well be limits on...  if the government in some hypothetical case which seems politically extremely unlikely were to assume total support for schools, that would mean that the religious elements within those schools are being subsidized by the government, but that has not been enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.434" offset="14256178">It is not likely to be enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.006" offset="14262447">This Court should take cases one at a time, and when the Congress passes a statute that provides secular, neutral, non-ideological equipment and material for children on a neutral basis, that not only is not a constitutional threat, Your Honors, that is something which is in the finest tradition of the First Amendment because it leaves people free to be able to make educational choices for themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.133" offset="14362967">The government then is not subsidizing and it is not favoring religion, but on the other hand, it is not in the rather illiberal position of denying basic technological tools of the 20th century to some children because their parents have chosen religious schools.</text>
