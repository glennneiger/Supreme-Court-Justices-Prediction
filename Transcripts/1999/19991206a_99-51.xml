            <text syncTime="39.836" offset="304496">Mr. Chief Justice... excuse me... and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="44.870" offset="324663">The issue before us this morning is whether Guam has already elected its current Governor or whether there must be a runoff election, and that depends, as you well know, on whether a majority is determined by counting the votes which have been cast in the gubernatorial race or whether, according to the respondents in the Ninth Circuit, we should could all of the ballots which were, in fact, issued in the general election, along at the same time, and then determine whether or not there was a majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.743" offset="452141">The net result of going along with what the Ninth Circuit has decided and what the respondents contend is that there are three suspect categories of votes which would be included in determining what constitutes a majority that were not votes cast in the gubernatorial race for one candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.596" offset="539598">The first was 1,313 ballots on which there was no vote for the Governor at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.107" offset="565616">The second was 609 ballots which were invalid because the voter voted for both slates, contrary to the statutes of Guam, and it was impossible to determine their choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.305" offset="618384">And then there was a third category of 1,019 votes on which the voter checked the box saying that the voter wanted to vote for a write in candidate, but then didn't write in a candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.287" offset="670315">So, another 1,000 ballots which were, in effect... in effect, blank ballots in... in the race for Governor.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.442" offset="698945">But on those ballots presumably... the record doesn't show... but presumably people turned in ballots on which they had voted in other races, but not the gubernatorial race at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.558" offset="743458">The net result of all of those votes was that the Gutierrez slate received some 24,250 votes and the Ada slate received 21,200.</text>

            <text syncTime="192.411" offset="914821">So, the net result is there was something like a 3,000 vote margin, which is really quite a comfortable margin in many elections which are so close these days.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.963" offset="949094">Here, if the Ninth Circuit and the respondents are correct, the result is going to change in determining a... it will change in this case, but can change in any case depending upon how enthusiastic many people are about coming in and voting for the school board members, grass roots kind of campaigns which will bring in a lot of people, or the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.968" offset="1045120">And if that brings in a lot of people to vote in those two races, then the... the barrier becomes much higher as to how many votes somebody has to get to be elected Governor.</text>

            <label>Mr. Seth M. Hufstedler</label>
            <text syncTime="283.864" offset="1280640">Two... two basic sets of issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.924" offset="1292865">The first issue is precisely this issue, and the court... trial court in Guam decided, contrary to the Ninth Circuit, that you looked at the votes cast in the gubernatorial election.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.160" offset="1333825">The second set of issues were a bunch of issues related to claimed fraud in connection with the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.057" offset="1361411">And that took many days of trial, and with very extensive opinion by the trial judge, the trial judge found no proof whatsoever of any kind of misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.960" offset="1397042">And those are the issues on appeal in the Supreme Court in Guam.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.423" offset="1410939">Now, there's nothing in this statute at all to suggest that the determination of the... of the majority should depend upon what happens in some other elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.659" offset="1467886">You all recall well that this argument is based primarily on an assertion by the Ninth Circuit and now by the respondents that if the phrase, in any election, really means in any gubernatorial election, then it's... it's duplicitous.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.004" offset="1533192">Surplus was the word.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.441" offset="1538939">They used the word twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.389" offset="1542805">Surplus and nullity.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.230" offset="1550119">And therefore, the interesting proposition is that sub silentio the respondent in the Ninth Circuit concedes that if the phrase, in any election, was not in that statute, the statute means in any gubernatorial election.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.076" offset="1613545">It can't be surplus unless the statute already says that.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.685" offset="1623994">Then the statute says, in any election.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.266" offset="1634234">And they say, well, that means any gubernatorial election.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.134" offset="1645727">The statute already means that and it can't mean that, and so we have to throw all of this out, even though it said it twice, and go find some different kind of election that's going to determine this.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.253" offset="1690240">And they determined now, as you know, that it was the specific general election in which the gubernatorial... of which the gubernatorial election was a part.</text>

            <text syncTime="479.402" offset="2062851">But with respect to the question that Justice Ginsburg asked about voting for Donald Duck, I'd call to your attention the... the opinion of this Court in 1997, the Foster case, in which the Court was obligated to define what an election is.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.406" offset="2130874">It involved a Louisiana primary and the question was whether the Federal statutes fixing a date had fixed it so that you couldn't have a, quote, election really prior to that in the primary that determined the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.570" offset="2179461">And here's what Justice Souter said in that case, quoting from page 71.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.294" offset="2206420">When the Federal statutes speak of, quote, the election, unquote, of a Senator or Representative, they plainly referred to the continued actions of the voters and the officials meant to make a final selection of an officeholder.</text>

            <text syncTime="533.128" offset="2277682">We're... when we say election, we're talking about a single election in a contest to determine who is going to be that officeholder.</text>

            <text syncTime="545.192" offset="2325956">And then it goes on to say... well, I think it doesn't add further.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.390" offset="2358766">It quotes the American Dictionary defining election as, quote, the act of choosing a person to fill an office.</text>

            <text syncTime="858.652" offset="3579834">But I... I don't know of any case that dealt with that problem, Justice Kennedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.161" offset="3593835">So, let me go back one last shot at the question Justice Ginsburg asked me a few minutes ago because there is another case dealing with somebody who wanted to vote for Donald Duck as a write in, and that was the Hawaii case you will remember, the Burdick case.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.486" offset="3659141">And here, the question was what is the vote about.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.041" offset="3677323">And the Court said... and I'm now at page... whatever... 436 of the U.S. Reports... the function of the election process is to winnow out and finally reject all but the chosen candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.771" offset="3752242">Now, that's what the Foster case says.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.353" offset="3762586">That's what the other cases say.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.540" offset="3767393">We're really trying to select a candidate for the officeholder in a particular race.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.445" offset="3786932">Not to provide a means and giving vent to, quote, short range political goals, pique, or personal quarrels.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.895" offset="3832803">In other words, if a vote for Donald Duck is intended to say, gee, I don't like anything that's going on here, the voter can go out and say that, but that's not a vote cast and that's not what the election is about.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.862" offset="3876689">The election is about electing a candidate, and a vote for Donald Duck doesn't do that and it doesn't constitute effectively a vote cast.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.446" offset="3906991">So, it seems to me that we really must come back, as Justice Scalia indicated a moment ago, to deal with the phrase what is a vote cast.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.290" offset="3946384">And I would like to... to deal specifically with the response that... that the respondents have come up with about that because you remember they said, which to me is quite an amazing thing, without any kind of an authority, and that is ballots and votes are fungible.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.202" offset="4017959">That's their word.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.985" offset="4021094">Fungible.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.118" offset="4025692">There's no difference between a ballot and a vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.653" offset="4035827">Now, I don't think that proposition has to be argued at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.325" offset="4050456">We all know what a ballot is.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.557" offset="4055471">We all know what a vote is.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.670" offset="4059860">And we all know they are very different.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.381" offset="4066756">And to illustrate in this case, the number of ballots returned was clearly 48,666.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.354" offset="4098625">The number of votes cast in that general election was over a million.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.980" offset="4117120">And therefore, if we count all the votes cast in that general election, that reaches the absurdity that everybody has agreed nobody could have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.020" offset="4153274">It would take 500,000 votes to be a majority in a race in which the only number of votes cast was less than 50,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.107" offset="4177620">So, it can't mean that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.789" offset="4184307">And clearly also, the votes cast in the gubernatorial election were 45,535.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.519" offset="4211265">The votes cast for the two candidate slates and the 275 votes cast for legitimate write in candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.872" offset="4244702">Those were the total votes cast.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.390" offset="4250763">And clearly there was a majority, a 53 percent majority, that the Gutierrez slate obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.085" offset="4277512">Now, let me point out a couple things which illustrates Congress knows the difference between a vote and a ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.288" offset="4302381">If a Congressman or a Congresswoman didn't know the difference between a ballot and a vote, I suspect they wouldn't be in Congress because they know that as well as anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.358" offset="4330593">But let me illustrate it by looking, for example, at section 1722, which is quoted in the text.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.695" offset="4364030">It... the text also appears on page 19 of... of our opening brief and the preceding statute on the same subject, 1719, appears on page 18 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.891" offset="4408751">But there what... this was a statute reenacted in 1998.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.666" offset="4427873">I'll tell you what it said before that in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.348" offset="4434560">But it says, the delegate... now, we're talking about delegates now, not... not the gubernatorial race because, you remember, the delegates was one of the other races that was involved in this general election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.997" offset="4473221">The delegate from the Virgin Islands shall be elected at large by separate ballot by a majority of votes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.292" offset="4502374">Any question that Congress knows what a ballot and a separate ballot is and what a vote is?</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.084" offset="4525571">I mean, they're using them there in the same sentence to mean obviously different things.</text>

            <text syncTime="1200.727" offset="4948127">But it makes it clear... and it says it clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.648" offset="4955755">And let me go to the next step.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.350" offset="4962652">So, we have a statute which we all think... we thought applies directly to this question of counting the votes in the gubernatorial election, and then we have a sentence that says it's going to be in all of the elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.063" offset="5013434">And you can argue a little bit about whether that's really surplusage or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.925" offset="5028898">But is there a principle that says when you look at the context of the statute and it means X, and then you have a sentence, which is different from the rest of the statute, which also means X, that therefore the statute can't mean X, that therefore we have to go find something entirely different?</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.721" offset="5104131">It says it twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.347" offset="5110609">It ought to mean it when it says it twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.513" offset="5119282">It isn't a question of, well, there's nothing in here about counting the votes in the general election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.561" offset="5135478">But let's go back and find out what we can and, boy, let's try the general election because that's different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.094" offset="5157630">There's nothing in the statute that says you use the votes in the general election, and that's something that's just... just dreamed up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.898" offset="5184797">So, the fungibility argument I think will not stand, and the result is, it seems to me, that this argument falls whether you approach from the beginning or the end.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.717" offset="5224085">If you approach the beginnings, the words in any election are a nullity and surplus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.400" offset="5246759">It seems to me that can't read whether... whether you follow the... the point that it really is a repetition or it isn't, it can't mean that you come up with an entirely different answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.478" offset="5287092">So, the nullity position won't stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.684" offset="5295974">Secondly, with regard to the question of fungibility, there's nothing in here that says you count ballots returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.079" offset="5333486">It says you count ballots... votes cast.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.883" offset="5344771">And therefore, if you're counting ballots... you're counting votes cast in the general election... and the court says specifically you count all the votes in the general election... then you reach the absurdity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.662" offset="5387821">You have to have 500,000 votes for your majority and you don't have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.971" offset="5405061">So, the result is that you can't reach it from the back because it's not fungible and you don't get an answer anybody could accept.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.776" offset="5432333">And you can't reach it from the front because, whether or not it's a nullity, the statute still means this and even if it... and we think it isn't a nullity because it does add something and it says it in a different way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.188" offset="5485936">I guess the last thing I would say is... and try to reserve some little time, if there is any left... that... and the statute I've given you, 1710... or 1712... it used to provide that there had to be a separate ballot in Guam and in the Virgin Islands for an election for delegate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.501" offset="5567230">Then in 1998, it was changed to say that you didn't have to have a separate ballot in Guam, but not the Virgin Islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.565" offset="5595442">The Virgin Islands still has to have two ballots.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.015" offset="5605264">Now, if you follow what the Ninth Circuit said literally, that would be creating a whole new realm for litigation, and you'll get one for certain from the Virgin Islands next time because now you have... assume the numbers which are wrong, but assume you're dealing again about... with about 45,000 voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.598" offset="5675585">You're going to have 45,000 ballots for the delegate, and you're going to have 45,000 ballots for the other races.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.648" offset="5703798">So, you're going to have 90,000 ballots returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.893" offset="5712784">Now, you have 90,000 ballots returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.889" offset="5720725">The majority is 45,000, and that's all the voters you've got.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.993" offset="5733159">Nobody will ever win an election in the Virgin Islands if that's the rule that is applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.700" offset="5756043">If I may, I'd like to reserve the rest of my time.</text>

            <text syncTime="3451.863" offset="13952640">The code does not provide for a second runoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.722" offset="13964134">And I would recommend to the Court to take a quick look at the amicus brief which makes a primary point that if you adopt a rule such as this, you're going to have a situation where you may never have a Governor elected in an election where it's close.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.022" offset="14029336">And certainly the blank ballots would... would rule that out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.281" offset="14042292">In connection with the Cass doctrine, I would also mention one other matter, which is a Federal case dealing with the Railroad Labor Act, the Virginia railroad case which is cited in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.275" offset="14090253">And there the act provides that you have to have a majority of the people in a particular trade in order to form a union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.507" offset="14115226">And the Court there says specifically it means, just as Cass did, only those voting and you've got to presume those who didn't vote go along with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.723" offset="14148141">But it explains the reason, and it explains the reason much as Cass did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.045" offset="14165381">And the reason is that a few disaffected people, a small minority, by not voting or voting some other peculiar way, could prevent the adoption of a very important principle one way or another--</text>

            <text syncTime="3529.474" offset="14263079">Because we have a lot of elections, some even in small jurisdictions, where they're won by one vote, and they're won when they're won by one vote after about three recounts, or however it comes out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.044" offset="14301427">With regard to the delegate statute having different language, we've talked about that at some length, and as I say, I think we get some help out of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.512" offset="14335282">They think it's good for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.039" offset="14341342">But the important point that hasn't been developed that's in the briefs is that the delegate statute is different from the organic act, but it was passed 4 years subsequently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.777" offset="14384287">Now, this argument seems to be that you adopt an organic act at one time and you don't say we're going to specifically count the majority in the gubernatorial election, although we now concede it says that twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.262" offset="14438204">That's the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.747" offset="14440190">Then we come back to 4 years later Congress adopts the act with respect to the delegate statute and says it has to be with regard to the... the votes for the delegate's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.504" offset="14491181">Now, can you say when a Congress does something in different language 4 years later, it has done something to the original act?</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.898" offset="14520751">The one answer might be that the Congress 4 years later had a better English teacher than the ones 4 years before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.875" offset="14544679">But however that comes about, you can't modify the statute 4 years before just because somebody used different language in a statute 4 years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.435" offset="14582923">With regard to the argument that in a runoff election the one who has simply the... got the most votes is going to win is not established at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.536" offset="14627331">If you look at page 26 of the respondents' brief, they cite two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.121" offset="14645721">They're of no help whatsoever.</text>
