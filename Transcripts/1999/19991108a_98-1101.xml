            <text syncTime="2402.400" offset="9738203">This Court has consistently held that you look to the realizable economic value of the taxpayer's rights, and you don't look to the State law fictions of retroactive renunciations and disclaimers.</text>

Mitchell, down in Louisiana, those delinquent taxpayers, they had a present right, and then they tried to disclaim it, and the Court said, look, an act of God cannot remove a Federal tax lien once it's attached, and I agree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.218" offset="11013501">The question...  the problem here is, it never attached.</text>
