            <text syncTime="3266.160" offset="13210604">And there's not a school district in this country... they would cringe, and the administrators would cringe if I as a lawyer stood up in front of a board and said, you know what, this is football, they should be able to do anything they want, and I think that's what I was attempting to address.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.511" offset="13268074">This Court has said that we should not ever subject the right of free speech and press and fundamental rights of liberty and property to a vote, and it should not depend on the outcome of a vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.511" offset="13320005">This Court has also said in Southworth that majoritarian vote is simply not viewpoint neutral, and this whole notion that somehow this becomes viewpoint neutral as we change the words from chaplain to message... excuse me, to invocation, and then message or invocation, is to put our heads in the sand and ignore the culture and the historical phenomenon of what is happening in Santa Fe, Texas.</text>
