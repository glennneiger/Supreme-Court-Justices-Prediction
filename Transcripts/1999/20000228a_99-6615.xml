            <text syncTime="16.666" offset="214018">My client, Michael Wayne Williams, was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death in the Commonwealth of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.771" offset="242335">In Mr. Williams' case, this Court is confronted with the meaning of the phrase, the applicant failed to develop, in section 2254(e)(2) of the Antiterrorism &amp; Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, or AEDPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.406" offset="300954">This morning, I intend to first discuss why the strict liability interpretation of (e)(2) offered by the Attorney General of Virginia is wrong, second, offer a more plausible interpretation of (e)(2) which is consistent with the statutory language, the decision of this Court from which the language was borrowed, other provisions in AEDPA and the incentive structures underlying AEDPA and, third, demonstrate why my client is entitled to an evidentiary hearing under the appropriate standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.707" offset="422162">In any case of statutory construction, this Court has repeatedly said that this inquiry should begin with an examination of the language itself, and the relevant part of 2254(e)(2) for our case reads, if the applicant has failed to develop the factual basis of a claim in State court proceedings, the court shall not hold an evidentiary hearing on the claim unless the applicant shows that the claim relies on either... and now I'm paraphrasing... a new rule of constitutional law, a factual predicate that could not have been previously discovered through the exercise of due diligence, accompanied by a showing of innocence, or a clear and convincing demonstration that no rational fact-finder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="125.762" offset="650368">It seems that if Congress were drafting a strict liability statute it would not likely have chosen the language of (e)(2), if the applicant has failed to develop the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.289" offset="696448">A strict liability statute, or a statute which did not care whose fault it was, would say something like, if the facts were not developed in a State court proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="170.433" offset="829045">Depending on the nature of the claims, the applicant will, but the phrase, if the applicant has failed to develop the facts, seems to indicate, clearly to me to indicate that the applicant must somehow be at fault.</text>

            <text syncTime="204.948" offset="967076">In many usages, and I think the most common usage, failed denotes some type of fault, some expectation left undone, and it seems if you tether failed with the applicant, if the applicant failed to develop, that certainly seems to encompass, I think, some type of fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.677" offset="1029979">A strict liability statute is often worded much differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.706" offset="1046175">I mean, a strict liability statute you would think most plausibly say, if the facts were not developed, which was a usage which was in play in habeas before this under the old Townsend five.</text>

            <text syncTime="260.301" offset="1188490">I think if you look at the statutory language itself, if the applicant has failed to develop, that looks at the conduct of counsel, what did counsel do?</text>
            <text syncTime="272.062" offset="1235511">The exception, the factual predicate that could not have previously been discovered through the exercise of due diligence, looks at the character of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.183" offset="1272082">In other words, I think the rule and the exception envisions a situation in which the applicant did fail, did leave something left undone, didn't reasonably develop the facts, but nevertheless is able to demonstrate that even if he or she had acted with due diligence they would not have discovered the evidence.</text>

            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="300.582" offset="1349614">Why do you put the choices between a strict liability matter and the word fail, connoting fault?</text>
            <text syncTime="314.935" offset="1407083">Aren't there a lot of intermediate positions?</text>
            <text syncTime="316.998" offset="1415338">I mean, for example, this provision might not apply at all where there is no State proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.464" offset="1433205">Suppose a State has a rule, we don't have a State proceeding, all right.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.619" offset="1445744">This isn't a matter of them failing anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.572" offset="1457552">On the other hand, there are a lot of State proceedings where... State situations where the State gives you the possibility of an evidentiary hearing and there, if the thing isn't in the record, and he may have failed to produce it, and the next part, due diligence says, but wait a minute, if it wasn't his fault, the defendant, of course he's excused.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.015" offset="1555354">I mean, that's the due diligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.326" offset="1564654">So the failure part takes out some situations, like the situation where the State doesn't even have a proceeding, and it talks about the thing, you know, the possibility is there for him to develop it, and then the next part, the due diligence part says, by the way, he has to have been at fault here, otherwise he's excused.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.958" offset="1655142">I mean, that's how I read the natural flow of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.472" offset="1665173">Now, is that wrong?</text>

            <label>Mr. John H. Blume</label>
            <text syncTime="380.799" offset="1670502">Well, I think it is, because... for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.423" offset="1685026">One, that would for all practical purpose eliminate hearings in most cases even when the applicant did absolutely nothing wrong, because the due diligence under this language has to be accompanied by a clear and convincing demonstration of innocence.</text>

            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="397.559" offset="1737584">Well, that itself I thought, and read in other briefs in earlier cases, presents quite a difficult question of interpretation, and that's why I was rather sorry to hear you concede that point, since I think lots of interpretation can go into that particular provision as to just what it means, and that is an issue that I don't think this Court has considered.</text>

            <text syncTime="422.096" offset="1835700">But I think logically to fail to develop would envision, both in its language and in its usage... I mean, Keeney v. Tamayas-Reyes is where this came from, I think most logically.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.561" offset="1877496">It's hard to say it just did not come out of Keeney, where Keeney used this exact formulation, did the person fail to develop, and Keeney was clearly talking about situations in which the applicant failed, was negligent, in which the applicant did not take advantage of opportunities to develop the facts in the State court proceedings, and this is the language that Congress chose.</text>

            <text syncTime="1638.602" offset="6701685">I'd like to start out to try to clear up a matter of Virginia law on a couple of points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.881" offset="6730838">Mr. Blume has reiterated that Williams is conceding he cannot make out this innocence requirement under 2254(e)(2)(B).</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.003" offset="6775351">In his reply brief, though, he does make some contentions about Virginia law and capital murder law that are flat wrong, and I suppose he does this in the context of trying to show materiality for his Brady claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.371" offset="6836791">But it is important that the Court be clear about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.011" offset="6847344">There is no doubt under Virginia law that someone who does what Williams got on the stand and admitted at trial that he did is guilty of capital murder under Virginia law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.553" offset="6893529">He admitted that he acted in concert with his codefendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.285" offset="6908471">He admitted that he intended to kill Mr. Keller.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.596" offset="6921636">He admitted that he intended for his codefendant to kill Mrs. Keller.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.517" offset="6941385">He admitted that he was a full participant in the armed robbery of the Kellers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1713.011" offset="6999377">Now, in the reply brief he comes back and tries to say, well, we don't really know where he shot him.</text>

            <text syncTime="2853.309" offset="11560565">Because the trial record of... or the State habeas exhibit that they submitted was a transcript of the codefendant's sentencing proceeding in which a psychiatric report was specifically mentioned.</text>

            <text syncTime="3513.525" offset="14201441">--Well, the answer is, the medical examiner had sort of an unusual view of contributory, and she said any wound is contributory.</text>

            <text syncTime="3534.438" offset="14285032">She said, I cannot tell, and that creates at a minimum a jury issue on the question, based upon the jury instructions that they were given, and certainly means... and the important thing, the answer to that is, when... there was a sufficiency of the evidence claim brought, just capital murder conviction on direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.698" offset="14354100">The Virginia supreme court didn't say, Mr. Williams is guilty on his own testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.117" offset="14367788">They went straight to Cruse's testimony, and that's what they relied upon.</text>

            <text syncTime="3566.333" offset="14412614">Why was that true?</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.582" offset="14417630">Because they hid Cruse out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.004" offset="14423272">They wouldn't even tell State habeas counsel where he was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.940" offset="14435080">They wouldn't let him interview him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.971" offset="14439155">He filed a motion for discovery, he filed a motion for an expert, he filed a motion for a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.374" offset="14456814">They said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.624" offset="14461829">The question about representation, Mr. Curry said... they asked him about the psych reports and the other things and he said, Michael Williams filed a lengthy request for exculpatory evidence prior to trial, and the Commonwealth responded to the request at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.275" offset="14516373">What else did that mean to you but, you asked for this type of information at trial, we gave it to you, you got everything you were supposed to get.</text>

            <text syncTime="3603.317" offset="14560572">But the deal and the psych report together, and that's the way I understand you look at Brady claims, cumulatively, would have dramatically undermined Cruse's testimony.</text>
