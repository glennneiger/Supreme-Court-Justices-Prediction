            <text syncTime="20.356" offset="225698">The first question is, was the Washington State supreme court correct when it held that a visitation order to a person other than a parent may not be granted absent a showing of physical or mental harm to the child, and the other question is, should the Court at this time resolve all of the constitutional questions that could be raised by any other orders, other than the Troxel order before this Court?</text>
            <text syncTime="44.499" offset="322246">The answer to those questions are, we believe, the court did not make the correct decision below requiring a greater standard by a specific showing of substantial harm to the child than is already required by the best interests of the child standard, and we also ask this Court to leave for another day the resolution of the constitutional questions that may be raised by other visitation orders not before the Court.</text>
