            <text syncTime="1292.102" offset="5300650">--Well, Justice Ginsburg, in fact, when imposing a term of supervised release under the guidelines, the court is to look at the severity of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.641" offset="5334818">There's classes of felonies that are... there's A, B, C, and D type class felonies, and depending upon the severity of the felony, that in turn makes the minimum supervised release term larger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.550" offset="5386436">So in fact the sentence itself, or the crime itself does have a bearing on supervised release, and although the respondent would admit that there are some rehabilitative aspects of supervised release, that doesn't mean that the converse is not also true, in that incarceration, although it's punitive in nature, does also have aspects of rehabilitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.285" offset="5493329">In the Bureau of Prisons a defendant can obtain his GED while he's incarcerated, he can obtain a trade, he can work in UNICOR and obtain a trade that way, or he can go to a specialized vocational school, he can take classes such as family parenting and different classes like that, so in fact incarceration is also rehabilitative in and of itself also, so the mere fact that supervised release is not solely punishment does not mean that you cannot give credit one for the other in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1430.859" offset="5855700">You can reduce the supervised release term down to a year, and you can, in fact, remove or eliminate some of the customary conditions of supervised release during the period in which it runs.</text>

            <text syncTime="2108.228" offset="8565120">But then you're getting, if the only collateral consequence is that particular matter, the length of the sentence affecting the length of a future sentence that may occur somewhere down the road, then you're getting to the point where there might not be a case or controversy sufficient enough for a court of appeals to decide the matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="2646.439" offset="10717923">On the point that a term of imprisonment may serve some of those same rehabilitative purposes as supervised release, that may be true, but supervised release is, indeed, different, because the defendant is living in the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.513" offset="10770273">It's only then that he can be expected to maintain a regular job, to receive the outpatient drug counseling that he may need, to meet his child support and other family obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.804" offset="10815412">It's one thing, for example, for a defendant to remain drug or alcohol-free when he's in prison, where drugs are not available at all, or available only in rare circumstances, and where he is under constant and pervasive supervision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.664" offset="10878838">It's quite another matter for the defendant to avoid use of drugs and alcohol when he's back in the community, subject to the same pressures and influences and temptations that got him into trouble in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.507" offset="10930247">That's one of the many reasons why supervised release is different, and why it is necessary as a rehabilitative measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.828" offset="10959504">On the point that Mr. Schad raised about the possible mooting of the case, the court of appeals held that the defendant's term of supervised release had terminated upon the issuance of the court of appeals decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.901" offset="11011853">At that point, he still had approximately 9 months to serve on supervised release.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.372" offset="11029721">Given the court of appeals opinion, it would be incorrect to assume that the defendant was still continuing in some manner to serve his term of supervised release, albeit without any sort of supervision by the probation office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.365" offset="11085727">In terms of holding defendant if he fails to agree to the payment, to a fine schedule, it's our understanding that the Bureau of Prisons indeed will hold defendants in those circumstances for the period of supervised release if they don't agree to a fine schedule.</text>

            <text syncTime="2764.266" offset="11189277">In terms of Mr. Schad's point on the necessity for a crediting rule in order to preserve appeals, Congress, as we pointed out in our reply brief, as dealt with that problem much more directly in 18 U.S.C. 3143, which provides for a defendant to be... remain on release status pending his appeal if it appears that otherwise his sentence could expire before his appeal is decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.833" offset="11299513">That, of course, is available only in particular circumstances where the defendant is not a threat or a risk of flight, and where he has some likelihood of prevailing on his appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.272" offset="11337339">Finally, Justice Scalia had inquired whether an abuse of... it might be held to be an abuse of discretion if a district court refuses to release a defendant in these circumstances after 1 year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.115" offset="11392718">The statutory language doesn't seem to allow that sort of rule, because it requires the district court to consider not only the interests of justice but also the conduct of the defendant, and if the defendant's conduct does not warrant the elimination of all supervised release at that time, it would be inappropriate to release him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.961" offset="11484042">The statute requires that the district court take into account a number of factors in deciding a motion under 3583(e)(1).</text>
