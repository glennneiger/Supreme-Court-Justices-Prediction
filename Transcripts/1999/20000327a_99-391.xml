            <text syncTime="9.815" offset="181476">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.900" offset="193805">Section 1367 plainly requires original jurisdiction as a predicate to the exercise of supplemental jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.686" offset="229019">In this case, supplemental jurisdiction may not be exercised over the claims of the absent class members because the claims of the named plaintiffs are not within the original jurisdiction of the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.027" offset="282308">The critical issue in this case, therefore, involves an issue of original jurisdiction and involves an interpretation, the proper interpretation of the matter-in-controversy requirement of the diversity statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.041" offset="342390">Specifically, the issue is whether the determination under that requirement that a particular plaintiff satisfies that requirement looks only to the value of that plaintiff's claims, or does it also look to the value of his coplaintiff's claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.712" offset="421071">The answer is, the matter-in-controversy rule is an all-or-nothing rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.371" offset="443745">Either all plaintiffs in the case satisfy it, or none do.</text>

            <text syncTime="87.396" offset="491810">That is, I take it that the Frees in their own right, if they were suing for their own individual injury, would not get anywhere near 50,000 dollars, because they're like all the others in that respect.</text>

            <text syncTime="100.379" offset="543742">It is true, Your Honor, that none of the plaintiffs have damages that would satisfy the then-applicable 50,000 dollars matter-in-controversy requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.625" offset="584702">The only reason the Fifth Circuit found that the named plaintiff satisfied that requirement was a Louisiana fee statute that awarded fees in a class action solely to the class representative.</text>

            <text syncTime="124.711" offset="641126">But then their ability to collect those fees depends on their bringing other people with them, that is, the solo plaintiffs who don't qualify for Federal court jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="139.100" offset="698596">The applicability of that Louisiana fee statute applies only in a class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.013" offset="722315">If there's no jurisdiction to bring a class action, that statute would not apply and the named plaintiffs, the Frees, would not have the jurisdictional amount.</text>

            <text syncTime="173.442" offset="836000">Yes, but if it goes to the amount in controversy, or diversity jurisdiction, it is jurisdictional and, even if you didn't bring it up, you know that we would have an obligation to do so on our own.</text>

            <text syncTime="188.637" offset="896813">We attempted in the Fifth Circuit, in the second appeal before that court, to raise certain issues of jurisdiction, subject matter jurisdiction which the Fifth Circuit refused to hear on the ground of the law of the case doctrine, and there are other issues, of course, which we do not agree with that the Fifth Circuit decided, but we are not squarely presenting those to this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="309.273" offset="1379347">First, let me summarize quickly what the reasons are that our interpretation of 1332, which fits within the language, is the better interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.652" offset="1420829">First, it avoids having section 1367 operate in a way that Congress clearly did not intend.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.900" offset="1461789">It could not be clearer that Congress did not intend, when it enacted 1367, to sweep aside a fundamental, longstanding rule of limiting diversity jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="380.854" offset="1665649">The plain language tells this Court that before supplemental jurisdiction can be exercised in this case, original jurisdiction has to exist, and so it refers the court from 1367 to the original jurisdiction statute, which in this case is 1332.</text>

            <text syncTime="410.930" offset="1785916">We're saying that the term, matter-in-controversy, in section 1332, is subject to different interpretations.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.758" offset="1821234">Our interpretation is certainly permissible, it fits within the language, and our interpretation is the preferred one for several reasons, the first of which I indicated was that Congress did not intend to overrule Zahn.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.181" offset="1874942">And Congress' intent can be effectuated in 1367 only if 1332 is interpreted in the way we suggest, and that task is called a classic judicial task that this Court recognized just last week in FDA v. Brown &amp; Williamson, to take multiple laws that have been passed over time and make them work in combination.</text>
