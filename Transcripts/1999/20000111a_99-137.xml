            <text syncTime="34.678" offset="290065">Unlike in California, the discretion of Georgia's parole board is based upon the ad hoc exercise of executive clemency power, and the board does not rely upon any statutory or regulatory standards to exercise that discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.254" offset="344400">Thus, the board can grant parole to any inmate within its jurisdiction for any reason at any time, including the interim between mandatory reconsideration dates.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.885" offset="382852">Both the Federal courts and Georgia's courts have agreed that because of its discretion, Georgia's parole system creates no legitimate expectation of parole.</text>

            <text syncTime="137.085" offset="699665">It comes from statistics in 1992, and it deals only with inmates who were actually released on parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.831" offset="726728">In 1992, less than 50 inmates out of a population of 4,000 life sentenced inmates were actually released on parole.</text>

            <text syncTime="156.415" offset="776987">I also understand that, in fact, following the... the change in the statute, somewhere in the neighborhood of about 70 percent of those who are given ultimate reconsideration for parole are not given it until after 8 years, so that we're talking about a period of 8 years that follows the initial 7-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.296" offset="868520">And, therefore, if anyone in Georgia, subject to parole reconsideration, is going to be paroled... and... and I guess we can assume some will be... those people at least are not going to be considered for 15 years as against the 12-year sentence for those who go... who got parole on some reconsideration theory under the old law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1638.528" offset="6705425">And that's why this Court was careful to say that it was the availability, for instance, of... it was the fact that extraordinary reconsideration was not foreclosed which allowed that... allowed that statute to be okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.523" offset="6761431">Again, if we compare California's statute with Georgia's statute, we're comparing a system that creates an expectation of parole with one that does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.016" offset="6799466">And there... that is important not because it's a due process case but because in California's system something was being taken away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.526" offset="6829454">Something that was protected by the Constitution was being taken away, and that is the expectation of parole by possibly delaying a reconsideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.192" offset="6868116">However, in Georgia's that is not being taken away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.076" offset="6879609">So, therefore, the existence of the same safeguards in Georgia, of course, militates toward finding that Georgia's statute is... passes muster on the... under the Ex Post Facto Clause just like California's did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.732" offset="6934258">Your Honor, ultimately the only change that has taken place in this case is how frequently the... the board must reconsider Mr. Jones after denying him parole and determining that it is not reasonable to conclude that he will be paroled in the interim of the set off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.991" offset="7003325">Any conclusion that this change increases the quantum of punishment is merely speculative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.598" offset="7025791">We would ask this Court to reverse the decision of the Eleventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.042" offset="7039479">I'd ask that I... that I could keep the remainder of my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1729.258" offset="7068423">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.445" offset="7097157">In order to understand why the retroactive application of Georgia's 8-year rule does pose a significant risk to inmates of increased confinement, I think it is important to first focus on the facts of the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.057" offset="7151596">And there are a number of facts about this system, none of which are disputed by petitioners, that really illustrate where the risk is inherent in the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.587" offset="7185660">First of all, we know that in Georgia consideration is an absolute prerequisite to... to parole release.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.715" offset="7214186">If an inmate is not considered for parole or reconsidered for parole, that inmate will not be released on parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.583" offset="7237696">Second of all, we know that in Georgia when the board considers or reconsiders an inmate for parole, the board makes not one but two determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.941" offset="7275103">The first determination is whether that inmate is entitled to parole today, and the board is correct, that over that determination they have broad discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.445" offset="7309167">But the board also makes a second determination that's the determination that we're talking about today, and that is what is the maximum possible interval that should take place between the present consideration and the next one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.099" offset="7355769">And it is that determination that is the problem here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3279.076" offset="13267698">I'm willing to... to accept counsel's representations that there was such a rule in 1995 because this policy statement and... and the ability of inmates to request this expedited consideration has been shown not to be a sufficient safeguard to really prevent these inmates from spending longer times in jail under the 8-year rule than they would under the 3-year rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.561" offset="13357559">What's also noticeably absent in this system is a safeguard that this Court relied on very heavily in the Morales case, and that was the ability of the California board, after the fact, to go back and advance the ultimate release date in the event that there had been an error or some unforeseen change in circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.005" offset="13435404">And it... that finding allowed this Court to find that there was basically no way an inmate in the California system was going to slip through the cracks and wind up spending more time in jail as a result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.885" offset="13478871">We don't have anything like this here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.958" offset="13487231">If the... if the inmate is considered and found appropriate... found to be an appropriate candidate for release, then the inmate is released at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.628" offset="13517846">There's no opportunity after the fact to go back and correct for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.217" offset="13532266">And if we have an inmate like we have with Gary Newberry, who's considered 6 months later than he would have been under the 3-year rule, there's no opportunity to go back and give Mr. Newberry or anybody like that the 6 months that he's lost under this... under the application of the new rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.650" offset="13589944">In conclusion, Your Honor, the Georgia system on its face provides far too great a risk for inmates to serve an increased term of confinement under the 3... under the 8-year rule than they would under the 3-year rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.427" offset="13649085">We know that in the... the State of Georgia, regardless of the precise number of years of an average life sentence, we know that inmates are regularly released that are serving life sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.416" offset="13697046">Last year the board tells us that they released 14.4 percent of the life sentenced inmates that they considered under this rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.771" offset="13726408">My client, who is 71 years old and has served 22 years in prison for his crimes, despite the severity of his crimes, is entitled to the consideration that the legislature provided for and entitled to a full and fair considerations of all the... all the relevant facts that might bear on a determination of whether or not he's suitable for parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.307" offset="13812612">By... by pushing his determination back for an 8-year period when he would have been entitled to review every 3 years under the old rule my client and others similarly situated to him are at a very significant, very meaningful level of risk of an increased sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.852" offset="13878754">And for that reason, the decision of the Eleventh Circuit should be affirmed.</text>
