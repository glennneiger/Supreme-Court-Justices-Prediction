            <text syncTime="14.058" offset="200800">Employees of State agencies who have been injured by violations of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act are not barred by the Eleventh Amendment from suing the States in Federal court for redress, because Congress unequivocally authorized such suits in the statute, and Congress had the power to do so under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.720" offset="275405">The authorization of these suits is established by the incorporation into the ADEA of section 16(b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.910" offset="312186">That section specifically provides for suits by employees against public agencies, including the States, in State or Federal court and, as this Court observed last year in Alden, it provides for those suits without regard for consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.020" offset="372581">By incorporating this provision into the ADEA, together with provisions which state that claims under the ADEA will be deemed to be claims under the Fair Labor Standards Act for this purpose, Congress unequivocally authorized these suits and abrogated the State's Eleventh Amendment immunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="101.699" offset="551363">The statute, of course in Seminole Tribe did not refer to the Eleventh Amendment, and the statute in Union Gas didn't refer to the Eleventh Amendment or sovereign immunity, and the Court held in both of those cases that the intent was clear to abrogate.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeremiah A. Collins</label>
            <text syncTime="129.699" offset="663376">And that was true in Missouri Employees as well, Your Honor, under the FLSA, but here Congress has gone further, as the Court observed in Alden, and clearer, in that it refers among other things to courts State or Federal, and to suits against any employer, including a public agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.762" offset="735578">And we also know, not merely from legislative history but from the retroactivity provision of the 1974 amendments to section 16(b), that Congress amended section 16(b) into its present form for the specific purpose of providing the clear statement of intent to abrogate that the Court had found lacking in Missouri Employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.260" offset="817603">So in these... in this situation the specific phrasing referring to public agencies, State or Federal courts, combined with the retroactivity provision making it unambiguous that the purpose of this provision is to provide an abrogation as to suits against States in Federal court, we believe is unequivocally clear.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeremiah A. Collins</label>
            <text syncTime="208.485" offset="978517">I don't believe that's correct, Justice Kennedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.170" offset="989175">The... of course, competent jurisdiction is a phrase used in many statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.924" offset="1016238">If it weren't used, a person conceivably could sue in an appellate court, sue in a small claims court, but this Court held in Wisconsin Department of Correction v. Schacht that the fact that an Eleventh Amendment immunity could be available in a particular case does not mean that the Federal court lacks jurisdiction over that case, lacks original jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.670" offset="1095232">So it seems to me that the phrase, competent jurisdiction, cannot properly be construed as importing defenses of consent or lack of consent, immunity defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.764" offset="1151552">I think Schacht is clear on that, and again, it is quite clear, I think not only from Alden but from the retroactivity provision of the '74 amendments that we have here a statute that's unusually explicit in being designed to provide the statement of clear intent that the Court upheld in Missouri to have been missing from the FLSA prior to the '74 amendments.</text>

            <text syncTime="306.099" offset="1368891">Now, Congress had the power to abrogate State immunity from claims under this statute because this is a statute aimed at arbitrary discrimination against a class of people based on stereotypes about that class.</text>

            <text syncTime="653.840" offset="2759859">And secondly, and equally important, the Court emphasized that it was applying a mode of review that applies when the courts are acting without congressional guidance.</text>

            <text syncTime="674.920" offset="2844182">The Court in fact emphasized that one of the justifications for the limited role the courts play in reviewing age-based classifications is that age is a matter that the political process can deal with.</text>

            <text syncTime="1662.571" offset="6794837">In 1974, Congress became the 26th legislature in the country to enact an age discrimination law that applied to public employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.494" offset="6830468">In 1983, 7 years later, this Court in EEOC v. Wyoming held that the Age Discrimination Act was permissible Commerce Clause legislation that applied to the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.484" offset="6878429">We do not challenge that holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.586" offset="6886893">In the Wyoming case, four justices also reached the question whether the age laws were permissible section 5 legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.359" offset="6917926">They concluded that they were not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.675" offset="6927226">We agree with that reasoning for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.327" offset="6937884">First, Congress failed unmistakably to abrogate the States' immunity from suit and, second, lacked the power to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.000" offset="6968499">As to the clear statement point, I'd like to pick up on some of the questioning in the first half of the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.487" offset="6990442">There are two principal problems, we would submit, with the clear statement claim petitioners have made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.974" offset="7012385">First of all, they have read 626(c) out of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.592" offset="7034850">The court enforcement provision that has existed in 626(c) from 1967 all the way to the present accomplishes nothing if petitioners' reading of the incorporation argument is correct, and that's the first problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.369" offset="7093991">The second problem is 626(c), even on its own terms, and I would even submit 216(b), does not suffice precisely for the reason Justice Kennedy identified, that the phrase, court of competent jurisdiction, still creates an ambiguity about abrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.980" offset="7156476">Indeed, that's exactly what the Court recognized in the Missouri Employees case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1803.996" offset="7360545">The useless act was to have 626(c), the very first sentence, still in existence after 1974, and it's an accepted canon of construction that Congress doesn't do a useless act, that the words of every statute have some purpose and meaning.</text>
