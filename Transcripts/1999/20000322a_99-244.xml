            <text syncTime="17.173" offset="214388">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This is a contract case in which my clients have paid more than $156 million for the right, as it said in... at Pet.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.460" offset="287531">App. 175a, to drill for, develop, and produce oil and gas resources off the Outer Banks of North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.891" offset="317206">Later, Congress intervened in the Outer Banks Protection Act and declared, quote, that the Secretary... and this at page 161a of the appendix to the petition... the Secretary of Interior shall not conduct a lease sale, issue any new leases, approve any exploration plan, approve any development and production plan, approve any application for permit to drill, or permit any drilling, for a period of not less than 13 months, and potentially for an indefinite period thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.269" offset="422740">Congress could hardly have been any clearer in its efforts to repudiate the basic lease obligations that the United States had undertaken with respect to the Mobil and Marathon leases here.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.960" offset="465477">Indeed, Congress specifically identified by name the Mobil Oil Corporation in the context of this particular statute, and said that it wanted to bring this lease to a halt.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.074" offset="506019">Not surprisingly, it had exactly that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.706" offset="520543">Not only did the Government categorically repudiate its obligations under the lease, but at the first opportunity in August of 1990, when Mobil, on behalf of the other producers in the Manteo Unit, submitted a plan of exploration, and sought approval to go forward at the very first steps under this lease, what the United States did, and it was quite clear about this, was it said, this is approvable in all respects under the Outer Continental Shelf's Lands Act, but we cannot approve it because of the Outer Banks Protection Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.574" offset="648020">We are prohibited from doing so, and as a consequence we suspended the lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.001" offset="661709">And then when the Secretary addressed the question from North Carolina as to whether or not the plan should be disapproved or otherwise modified, the Department said categorically, we cannot do that because it is approvable in all respects based on the 2,000-page report that had been submitted by the United States just months before this action was taken.</text>

            <text syncTime="149.230" offset="742584">Mr. Phillips, may I ask, this is a case with some complex provisions, and is it the case that under the lease the Government had the power at least to suspend the lease?</text>

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="164.834" offset="805069">Well, it certainly had the power to suspend the lease under certain conditions in section 5 of the lease that said that if there is a threat of irreparable injury to the environment, irreparable and significant injury, there was certainly the opportunity to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.034" offset="861807">But of course there's clearly, 1) never been a finding by the Secretary of Interior or anyone at Interior along those lines and, indeed, the Outer Banks Protection Act itself cannot substitute for that finding, because the Congress in the Outer Banks Protection Act made no effort to conclude that there was a serious threat.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.957" offset="929516">All it said was that there were concerns that had not been fully allayed even though this was in the face of a 2,000-page report.</text>

            <text syncTime="205.041" offset="965878">I thought to suspend a lease is a technical activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.416" offset="983328">The suspension of a lease means that the companies need not pay a series of payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.739" offset="1004644">The suspension of the lease does not mean that they suddenly do not have a time-related obligation in the Government to approve or to disapprove by a CZMA the plan of exploration.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.311" offset="1062949">Now, am I right about that, or not?</text>
            <text syncTime="232.738" offset="1076638">I mean, you are suspending the lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.991" offset="1093669">What you're complaining about is not... you're complaining about the fact that they did not within a specified time either approve or disapprove that plan, and you believe, and they don't contest it, they would have had to approve it under CZMA.</text>

            <text syncTime="255.689" offset="1168484">I mean, did they have a right under the reg to suspend the lease, not in just the sense, no payment, but in the sense that we can suspend the plan of exploration approval?</text>

            <text syncTime="293.129" offset="1318218">They said there was no significant risk created as a consequence of that, and while the Government has made the effort in this Court to suggest that there's no materiality in this context because the Outer Banks Protection Act basically supplies the findings that could have otherwise been supplied under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, it is absolutely clear to me that that cannot be the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.656" offset="1404318">The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act first of all does have a set of timing requirements and a certain specific suspension obligations that look to serious threats of harm, and also examines these things on the basis of environmental considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.704" offset="1464504">The Outer Banks Protection Act, in stark contrast, first of all has no timing element to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.565" offset="1487909">Once you get into the studies that are required under the Outer Banks Protection Act, there is no requirement to come back at any time within a reasonable period and, second of all, the question of environmental concerns is completely wiped away and, third of all, and I think perhaps in some ways most important, there is a socioeconomic obligation to collect information with respect to socioeconomic effects that you might engage in on the outer continental shelf lands by this exploration and production, and none of that occurs in the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.484" offset="1611625">That's strictly a function of the new amendments under the Outer Banks Protection Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="427.991" offset="1857699">Hornbook law for 300 years and this Court's decision in Nash v. Towne makes clear that under those circumstances the violating party is not free to keep something for nothing.</text>

            <text syncTime="457.674" offset="1976399">He didn't bother to address it specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.448" offset="1983505">They did address the suspension, our exercise of our rights under the memorandum of understanding, not under the lease but under the memorandum of understanding, to suspend these leases during the period of time that the CZMA objections were ongoing.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.225" offset="2042541">They identified that in the claims court as the only basis for waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.403" offset="2055289">But even if you give the United States the benefit of the opportunity to put waiver on the table at this stage, based on our filing of the exploration plan... based on our filing an appeal of the CZMA objection and then based on the suspensions, as a matter of law that cannot possibly represent an intentional relinquishment of our rights under this contract, particularly in the context of Court of Federal Claims litigation, where you have no right to seek specific performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.267" offset="2166780">You have no right to seek a declaration of your rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.422" offset="2179423">And in this case it's even worse than in any other case, because the United States could with all credibility argue until 1996 that they had never breached this contract because of the unmistakability doctrine and the sovereign acts doctrine that this Court had not repudiated at least until the Winstar decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="827.501" offset="3455661">First of all, that may be true, because that is exactly what restitution seeks to accomplish, which is to acknowledge or recognize that in certain circumstances events may work to the fortuity of the innocent party in a way that allows them to seek restitution where... even though it's a losing contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.219" offset="3522535">I mean, that is the basis of the Restatement 373 illustration.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.829" offset="3536954">One says that if you pay $20,000 to buy land, and the land's value drops to nothing, and the other side still doesn't, for whatever reason, give you the property, you are still entitled to the $20,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.823" offset="3585020">The other side doesn't get something for nothing under those circumstances, so you can classify it as a fortuity, but it is right at the core of what 300 years of restitution law is designed to allow us to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.763" offset="3628696">The second part of this, though is, you know, the expectations of the party at that point in time, in 1982, was that this was going to go through quite cleanly, and the evidence of that is pretty clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.486" offset="3675612">First of all, the first two requests for exploration plans were both approved by the Secretary and by the State of North Carolina with no objection at that point in time, and what... of course, it took us a while to develop the kind of environmental evidence we would need in order to put together this kind of a novel arrangement in this particular setting, and so time certainly ran through, but our expectations all along were that we would be in fact able to drill.</text>

            <text syncTime="1813.308" offset="7398897">Now, in that case there was also a Federal lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.371" offset="7407152">The Federal lease allowed the lessee to take 60,000 seals a year in Alaska, or such lesser number as the Secretary of the Treasury determined was appropriate to protect the species.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.196" offset="7446440">The United States, 2 years into that treaty, after having allowed 60,000 seals a year to be taken, made a treaty, which to protect the species limited the number of seals taken to 7,500.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.887" offset="7489281">The lessee sued saying that the United States can't tell the Secretary of the Treasury... I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.377" offset="7511224">I may have said that wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.015" offset="7513731">It was the Secretary of Treasury who was supposed to make the decision there... can't tell him how to exercise his discretion, and this Court said that... it rejected that claim and found there was no breach, and the reason applies directly here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.516" offset="7559707">The Court said, the United States is the lessee, is the lessor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.685" offset="7576425">The United States is the party to this contract, not the Secretary of the Interior, or the Secretary of the Treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.091" offset="7598055">The Secretary is merely the agent of the United States, and the United States, as the real party at interest under these leases, can direct its agent, the Secretary of the Treasury or Interior, to perform an act that is within the rights of the Government under the lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.323" offset="7658972">Now, it was plainly within the rights of the Government under the lease to suspend the lease performance to conduct these environmental investigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.087" offset="7690006">It should be common ground that the Secretary of the Interior had that authority, and because the Secretary had that authority under the lease, the United States, as the real party at interest, could direct him to do so, which is what happened here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1975.827" offset="8049033">What is needed in order to conduct the review is a threat of harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.377" offset="8063243">Now, if the investigation of that threatened harm results in a finding that there's a probable harm, then the Secretary may cancel the leases, and the leases... the moneys would be returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.772" offset="8108801">But if, investigating the threatened harm, there is no resulting finding of a probable harm, then the lease suspension is terminated, operations recommence and, under the regulations throughout this entire period the substantial rights of the lessee are protected by an automatic, rent-free extension of the lease for the period that the investigation is occurring.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.063" offset="8197931">Now, one of the things that Mobil says is, but there's a 30-day approval period in the statute for exploration plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.888" offset="8225202">Well, that, I... I think they may have backed away from that here, because it's quite clear in the legislative history and, indeed, in the text of the statute that that 30-day approval period, like any other period that applies under this statute, may be extended and suspended whenever the Government concludes that a suspension is warranted and that, of course, is exactly the reason that these leases were suspended by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.701" offset="8316527">But even if Mobil could find a basis for saying that we'd breached the lease, they still would not be entitled to rescission unless they established that there was a material breach, one that, in the words of the Second Circuit in the Frank Felix case, goes to the root of the agreement and destroys its essential object and, plainly, Mobil can't satisfy that requirement for two separate reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.043" offset="8401895">The first is that time of performance is not the sort of thing that routinely in the eyes of the law is of the essence and, plainly, it was not of the essence here because the document itself authorizes suspensions for environmental studies to be conducted and protects the rights of the lessee while those are occurring by giving him rent-free extensions of the lease provisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2827.523" offset="11455818">The United States Government, in the court of... in the Federal Circuit at page 39 of their brief said, if there had never been an OBPA in 1990, plaintiffs ostensibly would have received approval of their exploration plan within 30 days.</text>

            <text syncTime="2977.162" offset="12054336">It's not an environmental provision at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.134" offset="12066247">It talks about injury to tourism, which they now try to tie in oral argument on the fly to the notion that somehow there's an environmental impact here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.512" offset="12099684">I think it actually makes my point, which is that the Outer Banks Protection Act takes you out of the kinds of environmental concerns that were the core of what we entered into with the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, and has added this entire socioeconomic set of analyses that never had to exist before, and I think that finding is specifically embraced within it and completely beyond anything that the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act would have provided for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.539" offset="12195815">So it's the wrong... again, it's the wrong entity making the wrong findings, under circumstances that completely violate our agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.032" offset="12233849">With respect to the question of the timing of this and the notion of whether time was of the essence, I would simply note that in our memorandum of understanding that was entered into as part of the process in 1989, all three of the parties, the State, the Secretary, and the producers, specifically found at joint appendix 84 that time was of the essence by that point in this process, so that, frankly, is not an argument, even though I do think, Justice Scalia, you're right, is that time is the essence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.327" offset="12338966">There's got to be at least some reasonableness requirement that gets imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.042" offset="12353803">At the end of the day, again, it seems to me what we're talking about here is the simple question of when are you entitled to restitution to get something for nothing.</text>
