            <text syncTime="285.940" offset="1294945">First of all, this is not funding of a sign.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.333" offset="1308529">What actually happened in Tennessee... Tennessee has a program, a quote, minimum program that is Tennessee-specific, that is different, that is unique to Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.431" offset="1344891">Every other State basically has a project, but Tennessee decided to upgrade over what is required specifically under section 130.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.565" offset="1373417">Section 130 says, yeah, everybody should have a sign at a crossing.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.753" offset="1386165">Tennessee went beyond that and said, you have to have reflectorized crossbucks, and you have to have a warning sign at every crossing.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.137" offset="1415736">That is above and beyond the Federal minimum, and that is exactly what was placed on all of the projects that were involved in the 1987 Federal funding.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.279" offset="1448232">That's the scheme in place here.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.114" offset="1455651">Now, that's the factual distinction which says, this is not... even if you want to work off of a notion that there's a minimum sign program, which I don't think is incorporated into this regulatory scheme, it wouldn't apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.401" offset="1496715">But the more... but over and above that, it's clear that this regulatory scheme envisions that the Secretary will pay money and then be responsible, along with the State on a prospective basis for ensuring the safety and the protection of the citizens who have to make... who have to go across those particular crossings, and the Court understood that when it set out the legal framework to be applied in this particular context.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.217" offset="1604026">To be sure, the Court held there was no Federal funding at that particular site.</text>

            <text syncTime="614.163" offset="2607755">Normally when we have sort of a preemption here the railroads contribute something.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.463" offset="2624996">They pay a lot of money to do something, and in exchange they get the exemption from tort liability, but here it's rather odd, because as I understand from your brief the incentive to put in the safety devices for the railroads isn't... is not... tort liability doesn't provide a sufficient incentive, because the cost of installation exceeds their potential liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.675" offset="2705871">You say that in your brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.136" offset="2711722">And here it's rather unusual because the Government provides the money and with it provides total preemption and protection for the railroads, and the railroads get two benefits at no cost.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="652.390" stopTime="729.897">
            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="652.390" offset="2760728">But that... and the reason for that... I mean, it's not as though this is... I mean, the reason why there's no cost to the railroads is that there's no real benefit to the railroad because first of all, you know, having grade crossings does no benefit to the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.867" offset="2814645">If the railroad had its choice, it would close those roads so they don't go across the railroad, so that part of it, allowing them to keep going across doesn't provide any benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.426" offset="2848813">The safety that you're trying to provide... and that's why the Federal Government doesn't require, and expressly limits the amount the railroads can be made to pay for these particular projects, because they recognize the beneficiary of this particular program are the people, are the users of the highway, not the users of the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.229" offset="2920075">But the reason why it ends up with the particular situation you've described, Justice Stevens, is the nature of the relatively unique statutory preemption under 201.06 in title 49.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.000" offset="2963125">There, Congress made it clear that when the Secretary has adopted a requirement, then that preempts State law, and all that the Solicitor General's position and the Court held in CSX was that in this particular context, with the funding that we've made, it was subject to the approval, that creates a requirement that triggers covering the subject matter under the preemption provision, which is how you end up there.</text>

            <text syncTime="1096.493" offset="4537159">Justice Breyer, I'd like to begin with your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.292" offset="4548340">The main concern here is, what are you doing?</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.917" offset="4562864">Why should we allow a preemption if you're just putting in crossbucks without any independent determination of whether that's good enough?</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.604" offset="4593584">And the reason that that should not be a concern to this Court is that the respondents and the United States are attempting to get the Court to look at this particular aspect of the crossings program, when you go through and make sure that all the crossings have at least crossbucks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.475" offset="4661084">What they're forgetting about is the rest of the crossings program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.230" offset="4680101">Part 924 requires the States to have a prioritization scheme which collects astounding amounts of data about each of these crossings.</text>

            <text syncTime="1147.345" offset="4740496">It's in the same... 23 C.F.C. 6... part 924 generally describes the process by which you create, or collect the data about the crossings and then crunch it through, and you have a prioritization scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.270" offset="4816251">It's basically a mathematical formula that collects data about these.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.090" offset="4835478">The railroads are required to give the States data.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.940" offset="4846867">The States collect their own data.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.013" offset="4855226">They crunch the numbers and they come up with a priority score for each crossing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.382" offset="4876647">The States then, every year, look at all of the crossings and find where the crossings have the highest hazard risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.883" offset="4918651">Let's go and do active device conversions of those crossings, and that's what we do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.726" offset="4942057">Now, in Texas, for instance, we get approximately [$] 22 million a year for this program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.238" offset="4976121">In Texas, we could go to every passive device crossing in the State and put in new crossbucks and what-not every single year and only use about a third of our money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.469" offset="5025022">So if we did a State-wide crossings program, which we're actually getting ready to do another one to upgrade a lot of the crossbucks, we still have about two-thirds of our money to go down the survey and determine which crossings have the highest relative risk, where do we want to spend the money that we have to upgrade from crossbucks to active devices, and in Texas that's almost always gates and flashers, the (b)(3) type devices.</text>

            <text syncTime="3552.922" offset="14362857">Obviously concerned that the Court may actually conclude that what it said is what it meant in Easterwood, the Government and the respondents have asked you to create an entirely different regulatory scheme, and that is a scheme that no one has ever seen or identified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.352" offset="14416565">There is no regulatory footprints.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.132" offset="14427641">There are no regulatory fingerprints that even remotely suggest that there is a distinction between a minimum safety program and the (b)(3)(b)(4) adequate warning program which is the basis on which this Court decided preemption would turn in Easterwood.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.458" offset="14488976">And I would ask the Court to look at 130(d), which is the basis for the minimum safety program the Government identifies, and recognize that the language of 130(d), which is at 42a of the appendix to the petition, at a minimum such a schedule... it doesn't say anything about sites or anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.628" offset="14557626">The schedule has to provide for that, and the reason for that is, this is not a provision that creates an entirely new regulatory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.473" offset="14593048">If the Secretary had wanted to do so, it certainly would have been within the Secretary's discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.698" offset="14613946">That's not the regulatory scheme that the Secretary adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.141" offset="14627739">The one the Secretary adopted is the one the Court identified in Easterwood, and if it simply applies the language of Easterwood to this case, the outcome of this case seems to me to be foreordained.</text>

            <text syncTime="3629.977" offset="14671102">--that the floor is in the regulations, that there's no lack of statutory authority for the Secretary to do what Mr. Goldstein contends the Secretary did do?</text>

            <text syncTime="3643.258" offset="14724183">I think there's clearly statutory authority, and I think it's important to recognize that (b)(3) and (b)(4) are designed to implement 109, which is what's going to preserve the Government's ability to decide what safe, and what it's going to fund, and if the Secretary chooses to apply that in a different way, that's fine, but that's not the system that the Secretary employed in this particular case, and it's not the system the Court identified in Easterwood.</text>

            <text syncTime="3667.161" offset="14819791">What do you do with the argument that 109 only applies to Federal aid highways?</text>

            <text syncTime="3671.055" offset="14835360">109... well, first of all, there's a serious question about whether they intend that, but the bottom line about 109 is, the regulation still implements 109.</text>
            <text syncTime="3679.531" offset="14869319">Adequate is adequate for both of those, otherwise you make a mish-mash, and they can spend money on things that the Government would regard as unsafe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3687.257" offset="14900144">No basis for that.</text>
