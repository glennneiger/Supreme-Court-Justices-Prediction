            <text syncTime="32.384" offset="271388">The petitioners claim that the 1987 Honda Accord in this case was defectively designed under District of Columbia common law because it did not have an airbag in addition to a manual lap belt and shoulder harness.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.747" offset="340874">There are two primary reasons why these common law claims are not preempted here.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.401" offset="363443">First, Secretary Dole viewed these common law claims as furthering, rather than frustrating, the policies underlying standard 208.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.375" offset="407329">Second, even if Secretary Dole had wanted to preempt these common law claims, Congress expressly denied her the power to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.648" offset="444423">Now, the reason I say that petitioners' claims were seen by Secretary Dole as furthering the policies under standard 208 is because she herself said that.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.272" offset="486950">In explaining the rationale for adopting the rule, she said that she would rely on, quote, the potential liability for deficient systems, end quote, to make sure that the manufacturers did not all put in the cheaper passive restraint, automatic seatbelts, and instead started putting in more of the more expensive passive restraint airbags.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.487" offset="587783">That is her statement.</text>

            <text syncTime="142.693" offset="712648">But I... I still have difficulty in accepting it as... as the... with... as having the significance for your side that you want because it seems to me that if, in making that statement, she in effect was alluding to the significance or the power of the common law to, in effect, adopt the very rule that she was declining to adopt... i.e., you got to have the airbags... then she was, in effect, saying I'm relying upon the common law to thwart the very judgment that I am making now.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.699" offset="856635">And that seems very odd.</text>

            <text syncTime="185.167" offset="882549">I... I think we have to start with the understanding that Secretary Dole found and all of the manufacturers admitted that the safest, best system was exactly the one that we seek to have installed in this case, an airbag plus a manual lap belt and shoulder harness.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.778" offset="945034">She also was facing this Court's decision remanding the last rule that was issued as arbitrary and capricious because it didn't consider requiring airbags in all cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.501" offset="983904">Yet, she chose not to order airbags in all cars because she was concerned about cost considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.222" offset="1010758">She was concerned about manufacturer resistance, public acceptability, technological problems, and stifling innovation.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.394" offset="1039492">The reason she wanted tort liability to kick in, however, was because she knew... and she said it clearly... that if she simply required passive restraints generally, almost all the manufacturers would put in automatic seatbelts.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.618" offset="1096335">She did not seek tort liability because of the cost differences and these other factors I've mentioned.</text>

            <text syncTime="285.199" offset="1282640">But I think when the Government's argument is, as it is here, that the sole reason for preemption is a frustration of one of the Secretary's purposes and the Secretary herself refers to this as something she is relying on as creating an incentive towards doing the installation of airbags, I think it is... it carries great weight.</text>

            <text syncTime="318.522" offset="1415969">--Well, disregarding the statement, I still think, in terms of frustrating the policies underlying standard 208, there is no concern about frustrating the type of policies as Justice Souter was talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.247" offset="1462885">Because of the factual circumstances of the enormous cost differences and the other factors I've talked about, not only did the Secretary... the Secretary, leaving common law liability in place, still thought the manufacturers were not likely to install airbags enough, and that's why she did two other things as further incentives to prompt them to put in airbags.</text>

            <text syncTime="385.065" offset="1682105">And in a circumstance where the natural reading of standard in section 1392(d) would include State common law standards of care, and yet, several sections down, we find section 1397(k).</text>
            <text syncTime="401.259" offset="1746888">And what do we make of that--</text>

            <text syncTime="414.484" offset="1799760">And the reason I was going to standard 208 is because I agree with the United States' position here.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.305" offset="1823061">I do think that 1397(k) by its very terms... and it was the second argument I was pointing to... denies... expressly denies Secretary Dole the power to preempt common law claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="986.616" offset="4088296">And that was the point I was trying to make to Justice Scalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.251" offset="4098849">That is, the Congress did not give the Secretary the power to say, in passing this standard, I have a bunch of policies and one of my policies will be frustrated by common law claims, and therefore I pick out these common law claims and preempt them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.578" offset="4160185">And I believe section 1397(k) has to be read fairly to include that kind of decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.267" offset="4186934">That's why I was saying I don't think this Court needs to answer question one.</text>

            <text syncTime="1017.254" offset="4210862">But question two is, and I believe 1397(k) answers question two and it answers question two by saying, no, there is no preemption on this kind of an approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.895" offset="4257465">If there can be preemption on this kind of approach, then it seems to me you are essentially reading 1397(k) out of the act, or at least limiting it so severely as to wonder why Congress put it in there.</text>

            <text syncTime="1049.373" offset="4339385">It's relevant in my view both to section... question two, somewhat, but particularly to question three.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.111" offset="4362268">And that is, Justice Breyer, unlike the example that you gave in Medtronic where one of the beauties of giving it... the power to the agency is that they can... the agency can lay out its reasons and predict what its purposes are and say what's preempted and not preempted, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.738" offset="4432798">There is... this Secretary not only made the comment that I started my conversation with, but also made no comment whatsoever anywhere suggesting in any place that she intended to eliminate a common law claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.998" offset="4489850">Indeed, the entire structure of her approach was to not impose airbags on everyone, but rather to create... to trust it to the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.723" offset="4536766">And part of the market she was trusting was the tort liability system to internalize both the costs and the benefits of airbags versus automatic restraints of other types versus anything else that might come along in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.834" offset="4601236">I think it was an absolutely reasonable regulatory approach, but there is nothing to suggest whatsoever either that she considered preempting common law claims or suggested it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.123" offset="4646376">So, what would happen here is we would be talking about not a situation where either the Congress or the Secretary expressly preempted common law claims, we'd be talking... or where the Secretary even suggested a problem with common law claims--</text>

            <text syncTime="1171.088" offset="4826203">I think when the Secretary acts, first of all, in the face of a savings clause like this one, and in the face of the presumption against preemption, and she starts there and then she says that she intends to rely on potential liability for deficient systems to help her achieve her goals of pushing people away from automatic seatbelts and towards airbags, then later on in her rationale she actually quotes and describes... using her terms, she... she calls it another potential source of liability for the manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.242" offset="4962875">She specifically refers to no airbag claims again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.777" offset="4976981">And then she says nothing whatsoever to suggest that she's eliminating common law claims, but several times says that her concern with leaving it to the market, without any additions from her, is that even with the tort liability, there will not be enough airbags installed and people will put in automatic seatbelts because they're so much cheaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.376" offset="5067365">And so, she's not only using tort liability, but she's also phasing in the system over several years because she explains that will prompt more manufacturers to put in airbags.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.367" offset="5115326">And she gives them an extra credit for putting in cars with airbags; that is, she says, I would rather have 500... 50,000 cars on the road with airbags than 750,000... I'm sorry... than 75,000 cars on the road with automatic seatbelts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.812" offset="5185125">She hasn't simply thrown up her hands and left it alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.198" offset="5198709">She has put together a quite cohesive structure, which is I'm not going to impose this on high, but I am going to create an incentive system to prompt more airbags in cars and I'm going to leave it to the marketplace, including tort liability, to ultimately drive the manufacturers to the right decision, whatever that decision may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.243" offset="5278852">Now, the Federal Government's response to this... and they concede there is no conflict here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.146" offset="5302467">Their sole response to this is that this frustrates the Secretary's desires to have a diversity of passive restraints.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.419" offset="5335590">But I don't think that's... that's wrong for five reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.804" offset="5349069">First, that wasn't the Secretary's view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.589" offset="5360250">The Secretary viewed tort liability as enhancing diversity both generally and specifically, and I say specifically because given the cost considerations involved, she felt if there were not tort liability, there would not be as many airbags.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.647" offset="5416465">And so, this would actually enhance the diversity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.182" offset="5426601">Second, it ignores what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.134" offset="5434438">The entire theory the Government advances here is that if the manufacturers had had reason to believe they could have been held liable, then they all would have put in airbags.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.256" offset="5474875">Well, they did have reason to believe they could have been held liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.208" offset="5486683">In fact, they had no reason to believe in 1984 that they couldn't have been held liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.928" offset="5505595">There was never, at that time, even a court case finding preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.480" offset="5519806">And the Secretary had said everything she said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.830" offset="5529210">And yet, what did they do?</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.765" offset="5536942">They did not put airbags in most cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.300" offset="5547078">Third, it assumes that tort liability leads to everybody putting in airbags.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.288" offset="5571006">And I don't think it does as a logical matter because once you preserved all tort liability, the manufacturers are going to look at different cars and say, for these cars the cost and benefit calculation may be worth it; for these cars the cost and benefit calculation may not be worth it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.999" offset="5637879">They're going to look at all of the kinds of cases that we read about in the newspaper of people suing saying, the airbags shouldn't have been in my cars, and know that they feared that liability as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.938" offset="5677585">And so, it does not in any way inevitably lead to airbags being put in cars, as it has not.</text>

            <text syncTime="1411.672" offset="5788554">And so, even if you're looking at it in sort of the practical effect from here forward, no one can seriously argue the practical effect, even if now all the manufacturers ran out and retrofitted their cars with airbags in response to this case, would be anti-safety.</text>

            <text syncTime="1495.127" offset="6122398">Now, one of the questions is, well, all right, even putting that aside, why would Congress do what it did and treat these differently?</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.548" offset="6152074">I think the basic answer is that Congress was interested in helping to protect potential victims of crashes, and it knew it couldn't prevent all of the... prevent injury to all of those victims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.772" offset="6208916">And so, when you come to the common law, the question is whether you're going to hurt those people or help them.</text>

            <text syncTime="2347.024" offset="9530020">First of all, that appears at 49 Federal Register, page 29,000, and petitioners, both in their brief and again in oral argument, have simply ignored the preceding paragraph where the Secretary made it quite clear what she was referring to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.136" offset="9594385">In the preceding paragraph, she says, the phase-in will permit the manufacturers to ensure that whatever system they use is effective, trouble-free, and reliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.126" offset="9646421">And later on in the next paragraph, she refers to that manufacturers will be affected by product liability law not to put in deficient systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.382" offset="9679440">The Perry case that I've referred to already in the Fifth Circuit is exactly that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.786" offset="9701069">We've cited other cases in our brief that are exactly that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.405" offset="9715489">The Secretary wanted to use product liability law to ensure... to help to ensure that if you put in an automatic belt system, it wouldn't be a defective system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.094" offset="9754255">If you put in an airbag system, it wouldn't be a deficient system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.415" offset="9767525">But she was not... definitively not... saying that she wanted to have just airbags.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.967" offset="9785706">And... and my second response to that, Your Honor, is that from the very first moment that the Secretary was asked to speak to what it was that she intended in 1988, she said... the Secretary said, we intend preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.226" offset="9846728">And that is a position that the Government has consistently taken for more than a decade.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.447" offset="9863656">So, both... that was... the argument that the petitioners have made is a misreading of the Federal Register and it certainly misstates the position of the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="2453.794" offset="9957069">In the typical anti-preemption provisions in this very statute, in section 1392(d), there are two anti-preemption provisions, and they use the language that Congress always uses when it intends to limit preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.453" offset="10011718">They begin with the language that says, nothing in this section shall prevent the States from or nothing in this statute shall prevent the States from.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.475" offset="10047767">1397(k) begins with, compliance with a standard shall not affect... or not exempt, and that is language that this Court has never held to effect an anti-preemption result.</text>

            <text syncTime="2768.026" offset="11213977">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.578" offset="11236234">The last time... we agree, I should start off, with the court of appeals that this is a case of implied conflict preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.786" offset="11273014">The last time this statute was before the Court in Freightliner against Myrick, the Court engaged in an implied conflict preemption analysis and mentioned that there are two categories of implied conflict preemption: the impossibility to comply with both the State and Federal requirements or the classic kinds against Davidowitz, which has been referred to as the frustration category of implied conflict preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.655" offset="11396521">And that is the one that is relevant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.707" offset="11412717">We are talking only about the version of standard 208 that was in effect at the time this car was manufactured.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.129" offset="11454408">It was an evolutionary version of standard 208 that was adopted after a lengthy rulemaking proceeding in which the Secretary recognized certain then-existing problems, one of which was great public resistance to airbags which, as we say in footnote 20, airbags engendered the largest quantity and most vociferously worded comments during the rulemaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.850" offset="11581259">There was a proposal before the Secretary to develop... to adopt an all-airbag rule at that time, which she rejected in favor of a rule encouraging a variety of passive restraints in a proportion of the vehicles based on a conclusion that at that time diversity would best promote safety by promoting public acceptance of the passive restraints, by enabling the development of new and improved technologies, and enabling the agency to acquire more data to take the next step in this evolutionary process--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="2916.286" offset="11807061">Mr. Wallace, would you agree that she was building in some incentive to increase the number of airbags by counting them one and a half?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="2926.094" stopTime="3099.473">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="2926.094" offset="11846245">We... we describe that, and we think accurately, in context as a reasonable incentive to ensure that airbags would be in the mix of passive restraints since she did not impose a requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.021" offset="11909984">One of the concerns was that seatbelts often were not buckled in those days, and if airbags were the restraint someone was relying on, they might actually be in greater danger because they'd be riding without their seatbelt buckled, and they'd be vulnerable to other kinds of accidents in which the airbag would not deploy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.571" offset="12012175">That was one of the advantages of the passive seatbelt restraint against the airbags.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.725" offset="12040805">These had to be analyzed at the time in terms of public acceptability and in light of the experience the Department had just had with resistance to the ignition interlock system that they had had to compel the public to buckle up and the congressional action that followed repealing that because of public resistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.244" offset="12158878">So, we're talking about a... what were the implications of this version of the rule during a particular period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.100" offset="12194301">Now, we have been very mindful in this series of filings addressing this subject which three Solicitors General have submitted and we've cited them to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.492" offset="12243829">We've been very mindful that this statute is one that imposes only minimum standards that are adopted by the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.633" offset="12284371">That means that in the ordinary case the manufacturers are free to exceed the standard, and the implication would be that State law could not with a rival prescribe standards through administrative agencies but, through the tort suit system that is preserved, could hold the manufacturers to a higher standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.085" offset="12406206">But in... in the version of 208 that was in effect at this time, allowing a suit based on a theory that it was a design defect not to have an airbag in a 1987 car, this is not just a question of what a jury will find on its own but what theory can be presented to the jury and what the jury can be instructed, that that would frustrate the Secretary's finding--</text>

            <text syncTime="3157.893" offset="12773487">The complaint is only that every car had to have a particular kind of passive restraint, every car, and that's an airbag.</text>

            <label>Mr. Arthur H. Bryant</label>
            <text syncTime="3374.296" offset="13639081">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.165" offset="13650575">There might be frustration of purposes here if the Secretary had placed a ceiling on the number of cars with passive restraints generally or airbags specifically, discouraged manufacturers from installing passive restraints generally or airbags specifically, or suggested in any way that tort liability would conflict with her policies and that she intended to create some sort of liability-free zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.781" offset="13749004">None of those are true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.466" offset="13755692">The opposite is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.418" offset="13763528">She placed no limit on the number of passive restraints.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.037" offset="13773977">She placed no limit on the number of airbags, and she said she wanted to encourage both of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.588" offset="13796234">In addition, I think, Justice Breyer, the fact that you noted that this particular car had no passive restraints is critical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.610" offset="13828312">The argument about diversity of passive restraints and an airbag claim conflicting with that could theoretically apply if we were arguing it should have had an airbag instead of an automatic seatbelt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.085" offset="13878258">But when the car had no passive restraints at all, to say they should have put an airbag in it cannot, as a matter of pure, practical logic, in any way affect the diversity of what's put in cars that have automatic... I'm sorry... that have passive restraints in them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.947" offset="13941683">So, it doesn't get to the Government's theory at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.081" offset="13954222">And the response that Mr. Wheeler gave you about, well, she was wearing her seatbelt would make preemption turn on whether a person was wearing a seatbelt or not and actually make them worse off via preemption because they were wearing the seatbelt than they would be if they weren't wearing the seatbelt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.925" offset="14021618">And, of course, we're trying to encourage people to wear seatbelts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.562" offset="14036142">I think the basic issue here is whether Congress or Secretary Dole ever intended the manufacturers to be free from liability for failing to install the precise system that the Secretary of Transportation found and the manufacturers admitted was the best and safest system, an airbag plus a manual lap belt and shoulder harness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.594" offset="14132273">We say section 1397(k) makes clear that Congress intended no such result and the Secretary's entire statement and structure of the standard makes clear she intended no such result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.485" offset="14179816">And the notion that somehow a finding that the manufacturers can't be held liable for failing to install what the Secretary herself said was the best system because that would somehow frustrate the Secretary's policies is, we submit, nonsensical on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.078" offset="14242196">Thank you very much.</text>
