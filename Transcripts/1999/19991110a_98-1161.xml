            <text syncTime="532.080" offset="2268155">Mr. Karle, going back to the issue that Justice O'Connor raised on whether this is content-based, she asked you, as I recall, whether it was content-based because it seems to be directed to the particular category of nude dancing, not nudity generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.102" offset="2336283">As you answer that, I wonder if you would consider a variation on that question, which is what was the nub of what was bothering me here as a seeming distinction from the situation in Glen.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.479" offset="2385811">The statute by its...  the ordinance, rather, by its terms seems to cover all nudity.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.086" offset="2424158">The reference to it is, appears in the state of nudity, to describe what is proscribed, but there is at the same time the preamble that says, what we're really concerned with here is nude dancing, and there is a representation in the record...  it may have been from you.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.759" offset="2490927">I forget now...  to the effect that the statute is not going to be enforced against legitimate theater productions like Equitus, Equus and Oh Calcutta and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.506" offset="2533873">And so my variation on the question is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.139" offset="2552367">It sounds as though perhaps facially you could say it covers all nudity, but as applied it certainly is not covering all nudity and distinctions are being made, insofar as I can tell they are being made on the basis of content, on the basis of the artistic quality of the production in which the nudity occurs.</text>

I did not go back and reread my opinion, but I read excerpts from it in the brief, and my recollection is that I said, you know, if it turns out that either an overbreadth challenge or some kind of a challenge to the effect that it is not being enforced across the board were made, that might be a different case, and it sounds to me as though this is that different case.</text>
