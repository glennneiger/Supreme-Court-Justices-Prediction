          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="9.598" stopTime="398.982">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="9.598" offset="122649">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.439" offset="146054">In August 1996, the Food and Drug Administration published a final rule imposing regulations on the sale and marketing of tobacco products.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.790" offset="187432">The FDA found that nicotine is a drug and that cigarettes and smokeless tobacco are devices that deliver nicotine to the body.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.972" offset="224108">It concluded that it had jurisdiction to regulate tobacco products under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.545" offset="250440">A group of tobacco manufacturers, retailers and advertisers filed suit claiming among other things that the FDA lack the authority to regulate tobacco.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.971" offset="296102">The Federal District Court rejected this contention, but the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.624" offset="322747">In an opinion file with the Clerk of the Court today, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.598" offset="346675">Tobacco is perhaps the single most troubling public health problem our nation faces today, according to the FDA’s findings more than 400,000 Americans die each year from tobacco related illnesses such as cancer, respiratory illnesses and heart disease.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.004" offset="420236">Indeed tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States resulting in more deaths annually than Aids, car accidents, alcohol, homicides, illegal drug, suicides and fires combined.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.959" offset="484079">But no matter how important the issue a federal administrative agency seeks to address, its power to regulate in a public interest must always be grounded in a valid grant of authority from Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.978" offset="540190">And in examining the Act as a whole as well as Congress’ more specific efforts to address the problem of tobacco and health it is clear that Congress never intended to delegate to the FDA the authority to regulate tobacco.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.151" offset="608840">First, FDA jurisdiction over tobacco is incompatible with the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act's over all regulatory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.074" offset="644575">A fundamental precept of the Act is that all drugs or devices must be safe and effective for their intended use to obtain FDA approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.516" offset="682296">The FDA’s findings concerning the health hazards of tobacco demonstrate however, that tobacco products are not safe and effective for any use.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.793" offset="723465">Accordingly, were tobacco products with in the FDA’s jurisdiction, they would have to be removed form the market entirely, but Congress’ tobacco-specific statutes are expressly premised on the continued sale of tobacco products.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.862" offset="787726">They therefore foreclose a ban.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.119" offset="800683">To avoid this dilemma, the FDA has found that tobacco products are actually safe under the Act because in its opinion banning them would cause greater harm then leaving them on the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.247" offset="849271">But the Act requires the FDA to conclude that the drug or device is safe, not that one remedial measure taken by the agency is less dangerous than another, that is to permit a product to be sold, the FDA must determine that at least for some consumers the therapeutic benefits from using it outweigh its risks to health.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.856" offset="939654">The FDA cannot make such a finding for tobacco products, because according to its own findings cigarettes and smokeless tobacco are an unsafe means to obtaining any benefit or pharmacological effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.444" offset="998064">The inescapable conclusion is that they are not devices within the meaning of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.682" offset="1022933">If tobacco products cannot be used safely for any therapeutic purpose, and yet they cannot be banned, they just don’t fit within the FDA’s jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.795" offset="1071416">Moreover, Congress has specifically addressed the problem of tobacco and health in a manner that precludes any role for FDA regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.855" offset="1107674">Since 1965, Congress has enacted six separate statutes addressed to the marketing and sale of tobacco products.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.298" offset="1145395">That legislation establishes a distinct scheme for the regulation of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco that focuses on product labeling and advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.244" offset="1189176">As Congress enacted this legislation each time the FDA consistently, repeatedly, and resolutely stated that it had no authority to regulate tobacco.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.316" offset="1237555">Indeed from the enactment of the first Pure Food and Drug Act in 1908 until this rule making preceding, the FDA never want stated it had such jurisdiction and in passing these tobacco-specific statutes Congress several times explicitly considered and rejected bills that would have granted the FDA this authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.482" offset="1334208">In fact Congress consistently evidence its intent to preclude any agency from exercising significant policy-making authority in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.615" offset="1378721">Congress has expressly preempted any other regulation of tobacco product labeling even though the regulation of labeling is a central aspect of FDA oversight.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.296" offset="1429398">Under these circumstances, it is evident that Congress never intended the FDA to have the power to regulate tobacco and instead ratify the FDA’s long-held position that it lacks such jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.250" offset="1493241">We do not question the gravity of the issue that the FDA has sought to address.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.641" offset="1514766">The FDA has demonstrated that tobacco use particularly among children and adolescents is a very serious problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.653" offset="1546845">But in pursuing its mandate to promote public health, the FDA may only exercise the authority that it has been granted by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.660" offset="1582894">In reading the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act as a whole and in light of Congress' more specific tobacco legislation, we find it clear that for better or for worse Congress has not given the FDA the power to regulate tobacco.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.191" offset="1645065">Justice Breyer has filed a dissenting opinion, which Justices Stevens, Souter and Ginsburg have joined.</text>

        <section startTime="398.982" stopTime="704.366">
          <heading>Announcement of Justice Breyer</heading>
          <turn speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="398.982" stopTime="704.366">
            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="398.982" offset="1680174">As Justice O’Connor said, Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, Justice Ginsburg and I dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.442" offset="1710058">The Act that we are interpreting says that drugs include "articles other than food intended to affect the structure or any function of the body."</text>
            <text syncTime="420.452" offset="1766064">That language applies to chemicals that affect the body after being metabolized and it therefore applies to the chemical nicotine in cigarettes, which physically changes the brain and consequently stabilizes mood, suppresses apatite, and satisfies an addictive craving that the nicotine itself has created.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.274" offset="1861359">Cigarette manufacturers intend both means and ends.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.579" offset="1882570">An intent revealed many years ago by express advertisements and which is reveal today by internal memoranda stating for example “Think of the cigarette as a dispenser for a dose unit of nicotine.”</text>
            <text syncTime="467.834" offset="1955609">This court has previously said that the Acts’ words weren’t “a liberal construction consistent with the Acts’ overwriting purpose."</text>
            <text syncTime="480.580" offset="2006600">That purpose, protecting the public health, strongly supports our dissenting conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.769" offset="2035334">For as Justice O’Connor pointed out, tobacco products cause more deaths each year than AIDS, car accidents, alcohol, homicides, illegal drugs, suicides and fires combined.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.695" offset="2087057">The history of this 1938 New Deal Act offers further support.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.700" offset="2115060">The majority believes that the statute does not fit cigarettes because it requires the FDA to ban a dangerous product.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.920" offset="2151945">Well the FDA itself believes that a ban is inappropriate for cigarettes.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.950" offset="2176082">That argument suggests limits upon FDA’s remedial discretion not upon its jurisdiction, but even if we are wrong about that we do not think that the Act requires a ban.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.538" offset="2234388">Imagine an addictive sleeping pill, which turned out to be dangerous and not very effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.615" offset="2262704">The FDA might decide against an immediate ban for fear of dangerous black-market substitutes choosing instead lesser remedies that would promote a gradual withdraw.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.288" offset="2313382">Why would Congress want to force the FDA to choose a more dangerous remedy?</text>
            <text syncTime="565.888" offset="2347759">The language of the statute does not require that reverse result, the majority also points to other statutes enacted more recently against the legislative background in which the FDA itself denied it had jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.643" offset="2422783">Those denials at most may have created a legislative atmosphere in which many members of Congress did assume that the FDA would not take jurisdiction, but a legislative atmosphere is not a law unless it is embodied in statutory words and phrases.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.410" offset="2497911">The statutory words and phrases that are here at issue are silent, they do not reveal an intent to prevent the FDA ever from exercising jurisdiction; they simply leave the matter untouched where they found it.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.223" offset="2565098">According to the FDA only 2.5% of all smokers successfully stop smoking each year, even though 70% say they want to quit and 34% actually make an effort.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.838" offset="2619641">That fact helps illustrate a certain hard reality that nicotine in cigarettes creates a powerful physiological addiction, flowing from chemically induced changes in the brain.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.899" offset="2679828">That reality, the FDA’s finding of intent, the statute's language, the statute's purpose, and the statute's history are sufficient to show regulatory jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.359" offset="2737715">The majority today holds that a regulatory statute aimed at unsafe drugs and devices does not authorize regulation of a drug nicotine and a device a cigarette that the majority itself finds unsafe.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.419" offset="2805947">Far more than most, this particular drug and device, risks the life-threatening harms that administrative regulation seeks to rectify.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.278" offset="2849310">The majority’s conclusion is counter-intuitive and we believe, in dissent, that the law does not require that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.572" offset="2890583">That is why we dissent.</text>
