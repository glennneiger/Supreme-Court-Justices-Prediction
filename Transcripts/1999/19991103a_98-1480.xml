            <text syncTime="1863.501" offset="7596683">The holding in Sedima also was, however, pursuant to a 1962(c) substantive claim, that there must be, not racketeering injury, because the term is too amorphous.</text>

            <text syncTime="2761.808" offset="11189878">I am dealing, obviously, on behalf of my client with respect to this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.178" offset="11207327">There is no issue of Beck being a stop-gap, him being necessary, his elimination being necessary to allow the conspiracy to go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.029" offset="11262707">On this record, the Eleventh Circuit held that this was a retaliatory discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.504" offset="11288621">That wasn't its legal conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.485" offset="11296562">The way the case was pleaded, if you look at the joint appendix, page 69, paragraphs 49 through roughly 51, that was the allegation of conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.541" offset="11336790">In that allegation of conspiracy, the plaintiff contended, Mr. Beck contended that after he notified the Florida Department of Insurance of alleged wrongdoing, he was discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.089" offset="11382975">That theme was the theme on the summary judgment motion, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.662" offset="11401261">That theme was also the theme in the Eleventh Circuit opinion from which the writ of certiorari was granted, and the Eleventh Circuit said that there was a partial, using the Eleventh Circuit's language, there was a partial disclosure, the cat already being out of the bag.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.082" offset="11463014">Ergo, under the facts as pleaded and as argued in the summary judgment motion, there could not be an act in furtherance, even if there was an unlawful conspiracy, and assuming that the purpose of the conspiracy was to continue undetected, because the detection had already occurred by virtue of Mr. Beck's conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.055" offset="11542844">He alerted the very agency that had sole jurisdiction over this company to investigate, and did investigate the company, and to determine whether or not there was any improper acts occurring.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.482" offset="11588611">So on this record...  on this record, as Mr. Starkman said, if, in fact, the whistleblowing had occurred before the termination, which it did, then the act of termination couldn't be in furtherance of the alleged conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.432" offset="11656320">There's another reason, however, why whistleblowing of this sort cannot be and should not be the basis of RICO standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.069" offset="11686936">In listing the predicate acts of 196...  sorry, 1961(1), several of the predicate acts include obstruction of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.984" offset="11726537">Listed as one of the predicate acts is a violation of 18 U.S.C. section 1513, which is a retaliatory aspect of the obstruction of justice statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.085" offset="11782962">Congress limited conduct to be obstruction of justice, limited it to physical harm to one's person, or harm to tangible personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.863" offset="11830087">A precursor, a draft precursor of the statute included within it harm to a person's business, or harm to property nontangible in nature, wrongful discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.369" offset="11884108">That was eliminated from the final draft, which to me reflects the fact that Congress at least had in mind potential claims by whistleblowers who were making obstruction of justice a predicate act, and determined that there were too many difficulties...  too many difficulties in seeking to enforce that because of the multitude of motives that may exist when terminating somebody.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.115" offset="11975118">Was someone terminated because he really was a threat to criminal proceeding, or the prosecution of a criminal proceeding, or the detection of a criminal proceeding, or was he terminated because of legitimate business reasons.</text>
