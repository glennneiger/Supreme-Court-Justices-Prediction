            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="84523">The opinion of the Court in No. 99-116, Fischer against United States will be announced by Justice Kennedy.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="7.251" offset="113467">The petitioner was the president and a part-owner of a corporation which provided auditing services to health care organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.010" offset="140530">He was convicted under the federal criminal bribery statute for defrauding a municipal hospital authority in a $1.2 million loan and for paying a $10,000 kickback to the hospital authority’s chief financial officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.020" offset="200507">The hospitals participated in the Medicare program and during the relevant time they received over $10 million in Medicare funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.389" offset="234048">The question is whether those funds constitute benefits, within the meaning of the federal bribery statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.493" offset="258394">Now, we conclude that they do, and we affirm the petitioner’s convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.295" offset="273650">The statute's substantive provisions apply only if the defrauded organization and this is quoting from the statute, “Received in any one period benefits in excess of $10,000 under a federal program” the statute then goes on, but this is the relevant part.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.631" offset="338956">Both parties agreed Medicare as a federal insurance program and that the defrauded hospital received over $10,000 in Medicare funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.202" offset="365287">So, the dispute, as I have said, is whether the Medicare payments are benefits, a term that is undefined in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.502" offset="390469">The structure operation and purpose of the Medicare program provide essential instruction in resolving the statutory question.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.852" offset="415860">As the opinion explains in some detail, Medicare payments are made for significant reasons in addition to reimbursing a hospital for its costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.819" offset="451700">The Government does not make the payment unless the hospital complies with an intricate regulatory scheme, one which ensures provider posses the capacity to render ongoing care to qualifying patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.373" offset="493914">The Medicare program accomplishes this objective through an elaborate funding structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.965" offset="512304">The Medicare program structure refutes the petitioner’s assertion that the Medicare program provides benefits only to qualifying patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.200" offset="537277">Because the Medicare program operates with a purpose and design above and beyond point-of-sale patient care, we hold, the funds hospital receives under the program constitute benefits within the meaning of the federal bribery statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.343" offset="593806">We do not suggest federal funds disbursed under an assistance program will, in all instances, result in coverage of a recipient fraud under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.457" offset="626303">Such a broad construction of the term benefits would turn almost every act of fraud or bribery into a federal offense, upsetting a federal balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.876" offset="659948">The conrolling inquiry should examine the assistance program structure and operation and the conditions under which the defrauded organizations received the federal payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.231" offset="693385">The answer could depend, as it does in this case, on whether the recipient’s own operations are one of the reasons for maintaining the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.592" offset="722851">Health care organizations participating in the Medicare program satisfy the standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.703" offset="739256">The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.885" offset="752004">Justice Thomas has filed a dissenting opinion, which Justice Scalia joins.</text>
