            <text syncTime="11.270" offset="191203">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.703" offset="200921">Following the most extensive rulemaking in its history, the Food and Drug Administration concluded that nicotine in cigarettes and smokeless tobacco is highly addictive and has three other strong pharmacological effects on the body as a sedative, a stimulant, and an appetite suppressant.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.636" offset="288692">The FDA found that the manufacturers know this, that they know that consumers predominantly use their products to obtain these effects, and indeed that they engineer their products to deliver the precise doses of nicotine that consumers need to obtain its powerful effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.350" offset="371552">The question presented in this case is, whether given those findings, the FDA validly concluded that these products are drug-delivery devices under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.780" offset="425260">The Act defines drugs and devices to include, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="75.016" offset="446158">"articles...  other than food...  intended to affect the structure or any function of the body. "</text>
            <text syncTime="82.380" offset="475624">and the FDA found that nicotine is intended to do so in four quintessentially drug-like ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.057" offset="506344">Like No Doz, nicotine acts as a stimulant.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.187" offset="522854">Like Valium, it acts as a sedative.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.159" offset="534766">Like Dexatrim, it suppresses appetite, and like Methadone, it's used to satisfy an addiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.227" offset="567053">The FDA also found that cigarettes and smokeless tobacco have the classic characteristics of articles subject to regulation by the FDA.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.677" offset="612819">They are taken within the human body.</text>

            <text syncTime="1377.519" offset="5656228">Number one, there's...  there's no question that the paradigm examples of FDA regulation is regulation of substances that are put forward for purposes of...  of health or...  or curing disease or whatnot, even though there are exceptions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1456.169" offset="5970743">And finally, given this...  this, in effect, absence of FDA jurisdiction, the Congress has gone in, not with a global regulatory scheme, but with a lot of congressional statutes that attack various parts of the cigarette problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="1592.450" offset="6515866">Justice Souter, when...  when one is talking about a drug or a device that delivers a drug to the body, like a cigarette or a syringe, there is no problem applying the literal meaning, but in any event, the FDA went way beyond applying a literal meaning and looked at great length to the extent to which these devices...  and their intended effects resembled things over which they already regulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.917" offset="6621819">But my point is if they are right, if these products, because they are dangerous, must be banned, and the FDA cannot work with Congress to...  to accomplish an amendment to the statute that would, like so many other product-specific amendments, like saccharine, that have been enacted to enable the FDA to continue to regulate in accordance with its public health mandate, then two things will happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.657" offset="6740728">One, we will have an inability of this agency with the pragmatic responsibility to, for example, require them to use a filter or add a substance that would make these things less causing...  less able to cause cancer or less addictive, and, number two, we would have them remain as if not the only...  virtually the only finished product that is ingested in the body that is regulated and inspected by no Federal agency and yet is so dangerous.</text>

            <text syncTime="3190.115" offset="12906566">Health problem is obviously critical, but Congress in 1331 made it clear that it's balancing and making tradeoffs among a number of interests in addition to health.</text>

            <text syncTime="3270.341" offset="13227455">If you take that away from FDA, as Congress did with respect to tobacco products, there's no way to ensure as a practical matter that these products be safe and effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.357" offset="13267579">It would make no sense for Congress to delegate to FDA authority to regulate tobacco products as over-the-counter drugs and devices, but disable FDA from using the primary tool to ensure the safety of these products.</text>
