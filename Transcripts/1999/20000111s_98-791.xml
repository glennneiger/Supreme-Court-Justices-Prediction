            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="84485">The opinion of the Court in No. 98-791, Kimel against Florida Board of Regents and a companion case will be announced by Justice O’Connor.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="9.076" offset="120743">These cases come to us on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.694" offset="147179">In 1967, Congress passed the Age Discrimination in Employment Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.915" offset="172047">The Act makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against any individual on the basis of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.143" offset="200991">Although, the Act originally applied only to private employers, in 1974, Congress extended the Act to state and local government employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.183" offset="249161">In these cases, before the Court, three sets of plaintiffs, employees of the state filed suit under the act in Federal Court seeking money damages from their state employers based on alleged discrimination on the basis of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.941" offset="324185">In each case the state moved to dismiss the suit on the basis of its Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit in Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.047" offset="364622">In one case the District Court granted the motion to dismiss, but in the remaining cases the District Court denied the motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.028" offset="396596">Appeals in all three cases were consolidated before the Court of Appeals and in a divided opinion the Eleventh Circuit held that the Age Discrimination in Employment Act does not abrogate the State’s Eleventh Amendment immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.451" offset="458245">In an opinion filed with the Court today, we affirm that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.722" offset="479352">We hold that Congress did clearly state its intention to abrogate the State’s Sovereign Immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.768" offset="511535">The Act states that its requirement shall be enforced not only through its own remedial provisions but also through certain provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act and one of those provisions that Congress incorporated into that ADEA authorizes employees to bring law suits for money damages against state governments and both Federal and State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.308" offset="609651">Together, we think those provisions do sufficiently indicate Congress’ intent to abrogate the State’s Eleventh Amendment immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.212" offset="657298">Nevertheless, we conclude that in stripping the states of their Sovereign Immunity, Congress succeeded its constitutional authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.018" offset="696482">The Age Discrimination in Employment Act is not appropriate legislation under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.469" offset="734307">First, the Act imposes burdens on State and local governments that are disproportionate to any unconstitutional conduct that conceivably could be targeted by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.239" offset="785403">Because age is not a suspect classification under the Equal Protection Clause, states may take action on the basis of age without offending the Fourteenth Amendment so long as the classification is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.212" offset="861262">The rationality mandated by the Equal Protection Clause does not require states to match age distinctions and the legitimate interest they serve with razorlike precision.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.188" offset="913194">Rather states may validly rely on age as a proxy for individuals, abilities or characteristics.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.570" offset="942764">Judged against the standards it is clear that the ADEA’s broad prohibition on the use of age is disproportionate to any supposed remedial objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.953" offset="988217">Second, our examination of the Act's legislative record reveals that Congress had virtually no reason to believe that State and local governments were unconstitutionally discriminating against their employees on the basis of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.443" offset="1054255">Congress never identified any pattern of age discrimination by the states much less any discrimination at all that rose to the level of a constitutional violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.437" offset="1098141">That failure to uncover any significant pattern of unconstitutional discrimination, confirms that Congress had no reason to believe that broad prophylactic legislation was necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.826" offset="1151744">In light of the Act's indiscriminant scope and the lack of evidence of wide spread and unconstitutional age discrimination by the states, we hold that the ADEA is not a valid exercise of Congress’ Section 5 power.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.789" offset="1215587">The Act's purported abrogation of the State Sovereign Immunity is accordingly invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.215" offset="1241292">Justice Stevens has filed an opinion dissenting in part and concurring in part in which Justices Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer have joined; Justice Thomas has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part in which Justice Kennedy joins.</text>
