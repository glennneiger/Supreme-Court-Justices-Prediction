            <text syncTime="13.355" offset="199759">There is an intolerable risk in this case that the jurors erroneously and mistakenly believed that in sentencing the petitioner, they had a duty to sentence him to death upon the finding of an aggravating circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.349" offset="251691">This violates the Eighth Amendment and the petitioner seeks resentencing.</text>

            <text syncTime="32.940" offset="278022">First, the jurors promised to do two things: one, sentence according to the instructions; and two, come back and ask the court what the instructions meant if they didn't understand them.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.827" offset="321594">Number two, the actual sentencing instructions were quite short.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.059" offset="338522">The pertinent instructions are at pages 199 and 200 of the JA and are two-pages long.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.650" offset="360883">Number three, the jurors had these short instructions read to them in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.494" offset="380318">They heard these short instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.836" offset="389617">Number four, the jurors then took these short instructions with them into the jury room.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.927" offset="409993">They had them in the jury room.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.411" offset="415949">If there was any confusion or lack of memory about what the instructions said, they had them there to study.</text>

            <text syncTime="105.647" offset="568922">And then after that footnote, the Court goes on to say, were we concerned... and that's where the Boyde citation is... and the Court says, quote, in this context, in the context of all the things that had happened at trial... in this context under Boyde is satisfied.</text>

            <text syncTime="137.415" offset="695981">But also the fourth footnote says to me that if a juror had this understanding, the strained understanding, of the instruction, the Court would unanimously condemn it.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.051" offset="738509">And our argument is that these jurors had... or there's a risk... had this strained misunderstanding of the... of the instruction.</text>

            <text syncTime="213.744" offset="1001301">I think it may be a reasonably common practice for trial judges, when faced with a question from a jury about an instruction, to refer the jurors back to a particular instruction if the trial judge thinks that it's... that it properly answers the question.</text>

            <text syncTime="1802.398" offset="7355952">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.334" offset="7379671">First, let me deal with the Buchanan holding and counsel's suggestion today that the holding in Buchanan upholding the validity of the model jury instruction that was given verbatim in this case somehow was something less than an unqualified holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.090" offset="7466711">Counsel today, for example, talks about that the instruction was ambiguous but not wrong, and he refers to this ambiguity being recognized by the dissenters in Buchanan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.366" offset="7519792">But in the Fourth Circuit, after Buchanan had been decided, Weeks repeatedly indicated in his brief and his other post-opinion pleadings that Buchanan had, in fact, upheld and made clear the facial validity of the model jury instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.169" offset="7611012">He didn't say anything along the lines of, well, in certain contexts the instruction would be okay, but not in others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.323" offset="7639642">It was just a flat-out acknowledgement of the obvious, that the holding in Buchanan was, in fact, a holding on the merits and made clear that the jury instruction adequately explicated to the jury its sentencing options.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.160" offset="7702963">In his cert petition... and this Court in Buchanan talked about the model instruction establishing a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.999" offset="7750296">I think the words were a simple decisional tree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.280" offset="7763462">And Weeks in his cert petition echoed... he parroted that very language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.761" offset="7785405">He said much the same, that the model instruction given in... in the case and that the court referred the jury back to, that it established this decisional tree that a juror ought to understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.112" offset="7870773">The cart petition was premised upon a facially valid jury charge, and the question was, well, if you have a facially valid jury charge, but the jury, nevertheless, asked a question about that, where does that leave you?</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.745" offset="7937333">What sort of duty does the judge have with respect to dealing with that?</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.883" offset="7961888">But the point is the cert petition specifically presupposed the facial validity of the jury charge for purposes of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.505" offset="7996370">And this Court has made clear in any number of cases that where you have a premise in a cert petition, such as the one I've just said, that you can't later try to wiggle away from that and say, well, that's not really the premise--</text>

            <text syncTime="3242.531" offset="13116474">And Boyde also talked in terms of... of the common sense proposition about everything that has taken place in the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.215" offset="13147194">It seems to me you cannot just fix on the question and answer and say that that is controlling above everything else, both before and after.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.665" offset="13180945">One of the ironies of this case is that but for the question that was asked... and that is the linchpin of this appeal in the first place... but for that, we would not know certain things that are highly probative under the Boyde reasonable probability test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.580" offset="13252625">We know, for example, because the question was asked, that there were no follow-up questions, even though the jury in voir dire had basically said, if we do not fully understand an instruction, we promise to seek any necessary clarification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.919" offset="13309989">So, for 2 and a half... they had no follow-up questions.</text>
