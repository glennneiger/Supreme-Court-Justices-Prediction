            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="84460">The opinion of the Court in No. 98-1949, Pegram against Herdrich, will be announced by Justice Souter.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="8.700" offset="119255">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.601" offset="142765">The petitioner whom we will refer -- I am sure confusingly to you at the moment by the name of Carle, functioned as a Health Maintenance Organization or HMO owned by physicians and providing prepaid medical services.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.066" offset="216640">The respondent Cynthia Herdrich was enrolled in the HMO under an Employee Medical Plan and she sought medical care for abdominal pain.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.763" offset="259480">The petitioner Lori Pegram who was a Carle physician, made her Herdrich wait for eight days for an ultrasound procedure and during the wait Herdrich’s appendix ruptured.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.553" offset="314651">Herdrich sued for malpractice and fraud in State Court but ultimately the case was removed to Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.171" offset="341087">In Federal Court Herdrich made a new claim about a feature of the HMO scheme that rewarded physicians with year-end bonuses based on their collective success in limiting the amount of care dispensed.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.140" offset="396989">She said that, this was important because the HMO through its doctors was acting as a fiduciary within the meaning of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 Or ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.669" offset="451115">She claimed that when the HMO made decisions about treatment of medical plan and relieves, such decisions violated the HMO’s fiduciary duty because of the year-end bonus provision benefiting its physicians.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.216" offset="513286">The District Court ultimately dismissed this account on the ground that Carle was not acting as an ERISA fiduciary when it made these decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.373" offset="549858">The Seventh Circuit reversed the dismissal holding that Herdrich adequately pleaded the breach a fiduciary duty by Carle acting as an ERISA fiduciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.023" offset="596460">In a unanimous opinion filed with the Clerk of the Court today, we reverse the judgment of the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.182" offset="621120">We conclude that Congress did not intend an HMO to be treated as a fiduciary to the extent that it makes decisions about when and how to treat and enrollee of its plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.228" offset="669289">Decision with medical components are far from the traditional fiduciary duties with which Congress was concern in ERISA, and we doubt that Congress intended those decisions to be treated as fiduciary acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.867" offset="719862">Our doubt hardens into conviction when we consider the consequences of allowing Herdrich’s claim to go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.106" offset="748806">First, if such treatment decisions subjected HMOs to sue whenever financial considerations ended into a decision for profit and probably nonprofit HMOs, would be destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.792" offset="807529">Since, the entire point of the HMO structure is to inject cost consciousness into the treatment decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.869" offset="835846">Without more specific provision from Congress to judiciary we think, has not warrant to precipitate such an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.080" offset="868760">Second, even if we accepted the Seventh Circuit’s attempt to limit such an action to a case in which the soul purpose of denying or delaying treatment used to increase physician profits, we are concerned that the claims for breach of fiduciary duty would in fact just turn into the equivalent of State Malpractice Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.317" offset="953711">For reasons given in the opinion, we assure that Congress did not mean to turn the Federal Courts into alternative forms for all examples of medical malpractice litigation.</text>
