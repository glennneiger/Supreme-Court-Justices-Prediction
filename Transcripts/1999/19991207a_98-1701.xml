            <text syncTime="14.592" offset="203259">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="24.897" offset="244533">From the first day of our existence as a Nation, we've relied on the merchant ships of the United States and foreign nations to bear the vast preponderance of our interstate and our foreign commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.804" offset="288105">There have been some amicus submissions on this side of the argument that give you some sense not only of the historic scope of that reliance, but also the present scope and the complexity of the routes that these vessels travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.003" offset="336902">Each of these vessels is a complex collection of systems and subsystems, both structural and mechanical, but also each depends on the knowledge and skill and judgment of mariners not only from the United States, but from around the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.082" offset="397192">Each of these vessels is subject to an intricate Federal system of permits, inspections, certifications by personnel of the United States Coast Guard acting pursuant to authority vested in them by the United States Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.423" offset="458632">The Founders were very familiar with this industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.825" offset="472216">They knew it very well.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.706" offset="479739">They knew its complexities.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.589" offset="487263">They knew its central importance to the commerce of the United States and the economic health of its... of the Nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.292" offset="514116">And they knew its links to international law.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.104" offset="525297">They understood that each vessel carried with it a physical projection of the sovereignty of another Nation and they knew that the citizens aboard that vessel often were from other nations and that along with the possibility of prosperity that came with these maritime transactions, there also was the possibility of conflict with other nations in how we dealt with those vessels when they called at our ports.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.410" offset="618502">The United States and Intertanko here seek reversal of a decision from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals which I believe for the first time in the history of the United States countenanced an intrusion by a State government, in this case the State of Washington, into areas that are exclusively regulated by the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.702" offset="699690">And to define this field at the start, we are relying on the enumeration of subject matters in 46 U.S.C. 3703(a), the design, construction, alteration, repair, maintenance, equipping, personnel qualifications, and manning of the vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.046" offset="769072">This is the realm that we believe has strong Federal connotations that must be protected in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.898" offset="796448">By inserting itself into these subject matters, our concern is that the State of Washington necessarily displaces Federal judgments governing these vessels and compromises the constitutionally essential supremacy of Federal law in this particular area.</text>

            <text syncTime="514.448" offset="2202672">The thing that saved the tug escort requirement in Ray and which is not applicable here was the absence of a Federal presence in that particular element.</text>

            <text syncTime="1069.732" offset="4423811">First, the Oil Pollution Act addresses pollution not only from vessels but from land-based sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.274" offset="4441992">So, when Congress was attempting to save from preemptive effect preexisting authority, there is clearly State police power with respect to land-based oil pollution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.589" offset="4483266">There's no indication at all in the legislative history of... of the Oil Pollution Act, and in particular section 1018 where the conference committee that added that section said expressly that it had no intent to undo Ray v. Atlantic Richfield, which clearly upheld the preemptive scope of the Ports and Waterways Safety Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.773" offset="4559961">Moreover, there are things that are clearly saved by 1018, the response that a State can make to oil pollution, additional liability requirements that a State might impose, penalties for polluters, requirements and certificates of financial responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.402" offset="4618476">That doesn't mean that it brings the State on board the vessel to regulate the subjects that have been historically within the realm of Federal regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3397.155" offset="13733538">The whole system of cooperative federalism working together we think will make the waters safer, and ultimately we think that's what Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.663" offset="13775543">It didn't intend for the Coast Guard to be exclusive except in areas where it needed to be exclusive, the kinds of certificates that I talked about earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.606" offset="13811279">Therefore, we would ask this Court to affirm the result by the Ninth Circuit and continue to give Washington the authority to regulate and preserve the quality of our waters.</text>

            <label>Mr. David C. Frederick</label>
            <text syncTime="3434.618" offset="13883377">I'd like to make a... a couple of points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.491" offset="13890900">First, I direct the Court's attention to three footnotes in our reply brief which I think will help the Court in its opinion in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.606" offset="13923292">Those are footnotes 4, 12, and 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.469" offset="13938756">Footnote 4 sets out those BAP rules that are directly in fields that we think are preempted under the field preemptive theory of title II.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.476" offset="13970835">Footnote 12 sets out the BAP rules where there is a subject covered by a license and that includes things like language proficiency which is clearly a personnel qualification and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.855" offset="14020363">And note 14 is the only one where there arguably might be a reason to remand for purposes of developing a record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.047" offset="14049098">I would note that at the district court both sides made consensual motions for summary judgment and viewed this as something that could be decided on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.042" offset="14081072">As to those subjects in the field, that clearly could be the case here as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.797" offset="14100089">The treaties that I emphasized in my opening presentation reinforce the preemption that Congress specified in title II, and those treaties make very clear the reciprocal rights that must be afforded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.777" offset="14152020">What Washington here is... is purporting to be able to do is to imprison and impose civil fines against vessels and their operators for people who don't comply with State rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.524" offset="14199041">That's directly contrary to a long line of this Court's decisions that say that States can't supplement Federal licenses or federally recognized licenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.301" offset="14238120">Now, with respect to language proficiency, counsel is simply incorrect, and I would direct the Court's attention to page 36 of our opening brief where we make very clear that the purpose behind the international STCW requirement is to ensure that the vessel as a system can work appropriately so that those officers on the navigation watch can communicate with the people who will be carrying out the orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.017" offset="14328921">English may, in fact, be the problem in some circumstances and not the solution and that is a reflection of the way the international maritime commerce works.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.882" offset="14368418">Finally, I would just point out that the flag state controls, and with respect to drug testing and alcohol, there is a Coast Guard regulation that makes clear... it's at 33 C.F.R. 95.020... that no vessel, foreign or otherwise, may operate in U.S. waters by personnel who have an alcohol level above.04.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.339" offset="14462250">Now, that is indeed different from a zero tolerance level, but that is a determination made by the Coast Guard.</text>
