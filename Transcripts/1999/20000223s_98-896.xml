            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="10.534" offset="126140">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.566" offset="150278">Petitioner Mark Rotella claimed that the respondents, the doctors and related companies had conspired to keep him hospitalized in order to maximize their profits back in 1985 and 1986.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.076" offset="212240">Rotella discovered his injury in 1986.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.109" offset="232407">In 1994, Rotella learned that the hospital’s parent company and one of its directors had pleaded guilty that he had a criminal fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.713" offset="270859">That fraud related to illegal agreements and improper relationships between the company and its doctors.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.136" offset="304504">In 1997, Rotella filed a civil claim under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act known as RICO.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.242" offset="348913">The District Court granted the respondents summary judgment on the ground that the four-year statute of limitations period for civil RICO claims had expired in 1990, four years after Rotella admitted discovery of his injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.850" offset="407427">The Fifth Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.311" offset="417249">In the unanimous opinion filed today with the Clerk of the Court, we affirm the judgment of the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.050" offset="444207">RICO makes it wrongful to conduct an enterprise’s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.623" offset="470434">A pattern consists of at least two acts, the last of which occurred within ten years of a prior act.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.647" offset="502617">In agency holding company against Malley-Duff &amp; Associates, we adopted a four-year statute of limitations for civil RICO.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.190" offset="536785">Rotella argues that the four-year period should start to run only when a plaintiff like him discovers both the injury and the pattern of racketeering activity, but we declined to adopt Rotella’s proposed injury and patterned discover rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.295" offset="613167">To do that would extend the limitations period well beyond the time when a cause of action is complete and it would undermine the policies of repose and elimination of stale claims and the promotion of certainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.182" offset="672727">It would also clash with the limitations imposed and anti-trust suits under the Clayton Act, which Congress relied on as an analogy when RICO was under consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.033" offset="720060">Both the Clayton Act and RICO share the objective of encouraging civil litigation not merely to compensate victims, but deterring the victims themselves into private attorney’s general undertaking litigation in the public good.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.400" offset="777530">Such a benefit is better obtained sooner rather than later.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.625" offset="794457">The Clayton Act analogy reflects Congress’ clear intent to reject a longer rule under RICO.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.862" offset="819430">The fact that a RICO pattern maybe difficult to discover and often involves fraud is not enough to support the adoption of the rule that Rotella seeks.</text>
