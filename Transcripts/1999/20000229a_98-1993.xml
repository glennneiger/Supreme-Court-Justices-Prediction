Ohio, this Court said that where there is a reasonable suspicion that the individual is engaged in criminality, the officers can stop, and that where there is a reasonable belief that the individual is armed and presently dangerous... and presently dangerous... then the officer can conduct a frisk.</text>

            <text syncTime="3146.379" offset="12729371">--As I understand the predictive features, you predict conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.178" offset="12744522">As... well, of course, Wardlow didn't have conduct, but if... but it's the conduct that is the most critical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.122" offset="12768346">If the person said he's going to... on the street corner and he's going to catch the number 4 bus, well, that would be all the difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.469" offset="12797708">If he's standing there and he's not doing anything, you have no predictive features of anything to corroborate, and absent those predictive features, I think what you have in all seriousness is, you do have a situation where anybody, anywhere, could be stopped for nothing more than casual observation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.444" offset="12861656">This Court said in White that in order to allow for meaningful corroboration, there has to be that something more.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.093" offset="12888196">The tip has to be as to facts or events of things that are not occurring at the time that the tip was made, as to things that are not available by casual observation or rumor or reputation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.273" offset="12952980">And then, of course, the Court went on to the meaningful corroboration, and it used the predictive elements to provide that meaningful corroboration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.787" offset="12982968">In this sense, everything that was in that tip were things that were occurring at the time that the tip was made, everything in that tip were things that were available by casual observation, by somebody who just saw these guys and didn't like them, just didn't like them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.103" offset="13044199">I don't want these gentlemen in my neighborhood so I'm going to call in a tip.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.122" offset="13060291">There's nothing in the record to show or even suggest that this was a high crime area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.655" offset="13074501">There's absolutely nothing to show that these gentlemen made any furtive movements, that they ran from police.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.310" offset="13097071">The typical situation again is that the police come up and they confront somebody, and if they sweat, if they gave evasive answers, if they make furtive movements, if they run, that's the typical situation where a tip which has only details of identification might be sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.057" offset="13152033">In this case, there wasn't any of that, and the State's not even suggesting that there ought to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.227" offset="13168751">What the State is saying is that if there is a bald tip with a naked assertion, that's enough, and we would suggest to the Court that under White and under Adams v. Williams, Illinois v. Gates, the answer to that is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.178" offset="13224549">There has to be a meaningful corroboration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.605" offset="13238237">Thank you, Your Honors.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael J. Neimand</label>
            <text syncTime="3416.146" offset="13808438">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.664" offset="13808333">The questions concerning the bomb really underscore the duality of the issues in front of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.896" offset="13808229">The first issue is that the Florida supreme court said an anonymous tip could never be enough, and clearly, with the bomb situation it would have to be enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.753" offset="13808124">There's too much public safety involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.445" offset="13808020">The second question then becomes, under the facts of this case, were the facts sufficient to allow the stop and frisk under the situation?</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.156" offset="13807915">In this situation, because it was a juvenile... there is a problem in Florida with juveniles and hand guns... the tip was immediately corroborated, these individuals were at the exact location, dressed accordingly, within 6 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.645" offset="13807811">Then what were the officers supposed to do under those circumstances?</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.641" offset="13807706">The officer could have waited and put the public safety in jeopardy, or could have gone to investigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.360" offset="13807602">If he investigated he would have put his life in jeopardy by not immediately frisking the individual, and that is why in this case, on the factual situation the State submits that the Florida supreme court was wrong, if, in fact, on the law they were wrong as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.303" offset="13807497">As to the question of the 22-year-old in Florida, because an individual has only a privilege to carry a concealed firearm, there really is no problem with an officer if there is a tip that an individual is carrying a concealed firearm who is 22, or even older, to come up to that individual and ask for the permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.512" offset="13807393">But before you ask for the permit, if you ask somebody for a gun, just because they're legally carrying the gun, that doesn't mean they're going to legally use the gun and therefore, again, even in that situation the public safety, the officer's safety in ascertaining whether or not the individual has a permit to carry that gun would allow the immediate frisk upon the stop, and then the interrogation occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.372" offset="13807288">And upon the interrogation, do you have a permit, yes, I do, here it is, thank you very much, here's your gun, and the stop as a Terry stop should be as limited because the criminal activity, suspicion of criminal activity was dispelled, and that's the dispelling point of it in this type of situation.</text>
