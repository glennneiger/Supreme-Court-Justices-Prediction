            <label>Mr. James A. Feldman</label>
            <text syncTime="10.039" offset="192086">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.758" offset="202953">This case concerns Congress' attempt to address the problem of graphic sexually explicit adult programming that is available on cable televisions... on cable television to minors with merely the flip of a dial.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.031" offset="256034">It's available to children even though their parents have not subscribed to the cable channels carrying the programming and therefore have every reason to believe that they're not receiving that programming on their televisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.689" offset="298666">The phenomenon is known as signal bleed, and it occurs when a cable operator scrambles partially the video portion of a premium channel like that operated by appellee, but... and... but meanwhile the soundtrack from that channel and other portions of the video programming are allowed to get through, even to non-subscribers.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.687" offset="382675">As a result, children with access to cable television gain access intentionally or accidentally to what the district court termed the virtually 100 percent sexually explicit programming.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="68.810" offset="427188">Mr. Feldman, is there evidence in the record of actual signal bleed as opposed to the potential for it?</text>
            <text syncTime="75.898" offset="455505">I mean, what... what does the record show?</text>

            <label>Mr. James A. Feldman</label>
            <text syncTime="78.016" offset="463969">There's very substantial evidence of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.868" offset="475358">In the first place... and I think the easiest way to approach that is the district court found that on most cable television systems... and there's some variation, to be sure, but on most cable television systems, the audio portion of programming on channels like those that Playboy or Spice or Spice Hot operates... the audio portion goes through unhindered.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.282" offset="557069">So, that... that's there and that's a finding of the district court.</text>

            <label>Mr. James A. Feldman</label>
            <text syncTime="127.497" offset="661872">The Court has never said that with respect to the question of indecency on cable television, and in fact, the Court has specifically declined to decide that question in the past on a number... several occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.871" offset="707430">In our view, the right answer, for the reasons given in our brief, is not quite strict scrutiny; that is, there should be a showing of a compelling interest because it is a content-based regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.513" offset="749957">But some deference should be given in light of the factors that the Court has noted in Pacifica and later cases, the pervasiveness into the... in the home, the harm to children.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.819" offset="787155">Some deference should be given to Congress' choice among alternatives of... of how to deal with the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.188" offset="812651">And especially that's true where what the... the alternative that Congress has chosen is time-channeling as one option, which permits the cable operator to show the... show the material from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. unhindered and with no restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.198" offset="864687">That is the... that's the solution that the Court approved in Pacifica, and it's a reasonable accommodation of the competing interests.</text>

            <text syncTime="196.244" offset="936889">I mean, I've read some of the footnotes in... in your brief that describe... describe these matters.</text>

            <text syncTime="235.035" offset="1092057">There's no factual finding of the court below that this was not obscenity, is there?</text>
            <text syncTime="241.356" offset="1117343">And even if there were, I just can't... can't imagine that what you describe in your brief doesn't qualify as obscenity.</text>

            <text syncTime="253.613" offset="1166349">One reason is that the obscenity issue turns on contemporary community standards in different communities across the country.</text>

            <text syncTime="1284.312" offset="5289203">One reason is you're operating against... in a situation where the cable operator has a financial incentive not to give the notice both because giving the notice is expensive.</text>

            <text syncTime="1300.657" offset="5354509">Secondly, you're operating against a system where the parent already thinks that he's not getting it and it requires an exceptional amount of notice and effective notice in order to take a parent who thinks he's not getting it and convince him that he is getting it, and therefore he has to act once again and do something.</text>

            <text syncTime="3262.125" offset="13200439">I don't know if you'd call it a finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.508" offset="13205977">It seemed more offhand than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.410" offset="13213500">But the Government did... I mean, the... the district court did make that assumption despite the evidence that was presented below even by the Government that that wouldn't be required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.433" offset="13245683">Ultimately to resolve the Court... this case in the Government's favor, they're really asking this Court to make a number of changes, significant changes in... in First Amendment doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.671" offset="13290613">First, they're asking this Court to apply the Pacifica precedent specifically to cable television, which this Court, at least in the past, has declined to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.227" offset="13320811">And secondly, they're asking for the authority to restrict the speech available in all households in a cable community even though they acknowledge that parents are fully able to block the offensive speech in a particular household.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.252" offset="13372951">And third, they're... they're asking to significantly limit the doctrine of least restrictive means as it applies in First Amendment cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.891" offset="13399492">There's really nothing in this Court's prior decisions... and as the district court found... that would justify significant changes in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.145" offset="13428540">This is particularly true with respect to the notion of individual user empowerment and as we look at newer technologies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.865" offset="13455394">If the Government were correct that the complete ability of a household to stop offensive speech coming into the home is ineffective and is not sufficient to forestall the need for Government regulation, then it would open a wide avenue for the regulation not just of cable television, but of other new technologies that do empower individuals to take steps on their own either through market-based measures or through other less restrictive regulatory measures to address those issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.468" offset="13573781">And for that reason, it would be a significant change in the law.</text>

            <label>Mr. James A. Feldman</label>
            <text syncTime="3477.747" offset="14062898">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.477" offset="14062793">I just... I wanted to point... direct the Court's attention... the factual findings... the facts on the issues that Mr. Corn-Revere were talking... was talking about... there was disagreement between the Government and Playboy on them, and the district court found in our favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.368" offset="14062689">The 3 percent and 6 percent figures are what the district court... this is on page 22a of the JS appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.956" offset="14062584">The district court found that those are the figures, depending on how long you allow the cable operator to recover its cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.843" offset="14062480">Those are the figures that would totally exhaust the revenues, that if 3 to 6 percent of the subscribers requested blocking, the revenues that the cable operator got from Playboy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.549" offset="14062375">The district court then found that, in fact, cable operators would drop Playboy before it exhausted all the revenues, but when it just was no longer making enough profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.771" offset="14062271">That's on 22a.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.173" offset="14062166">The district court also in footnote 21 on that same page said, Playboy's contention that negative traps can be mailed to subscribers, thereby obviating the need for installation labor costs and lowering the cost of mechanism... per mechanism, is unavailing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.981" offset="14062062">That sounds to me like a finding of fact that the district court thought that Playboy was wrong on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.301" offset="14061957">I'd just like to conclude by saying that Congress adopted here a time-channeling alternative that permits... permits the material to be shown from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. when most of the audience for the material is there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.644" offset="14061853">The people who... people have... given the virtually universal presence of video cassette recorders in homes, people who want to watch it at other times can watch it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.914" offset="14061748">But it imposes the least risk to children.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.250" offset="14061644">That was a... more than a reasonable... that was the only effective solution to the problem that Congress saw.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.106" offset="14061539">And there... Playboy hasn't suggested any reason why Congress' determination that that test, 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. safe harbor which governs the same kind of problem on broadcast television, shouldn't be equally applicable and equally effective here.</text>
