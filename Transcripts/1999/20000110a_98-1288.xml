            <text syncTime="2188.306" offset="8895392">Before I get into the merits of the arguments that have been made on behalf of the Village of Willowbrook, I'd like to address the matter of what questions are properly before this Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.649" offset="8944711">As the Court is aware, there were two questions raised in the petition for a writ of certiorari, the first being whether the Equal Protection Clause gives rise to a cause of action on behalf of a class of one where the plaintiff has not alleged membership in a vulnerable group, but rather that ill will caused the government to treat her differently from others similarly situated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.367" offset="9047633">The second question was whether the government conduct alleged in Mrs. Olech's amended complaint meets the standard to state a cause of action on behalf of a class of one, assuming that the Equal Protection Clause protects such individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.662" offset="9116806">Now, this Court in this case granted certiorari limited to question one, and what that means, I believe, is that arguments that fall within the scope of question two are not properly before this Court because this Court has in effect denied certiorari on question two, and we've cited the case of Missouri v. Jenkins from this Court, where there was a limited grant of certiorari on one of two questions, and in that case, which was a school desegregation case, the State made arguments that really fell within the scope of the question which had not been...  on which certiorari had not been granted, and this Court said that those questions would not be considered.</text>

            <text syncTime="2313.136" offset="9394644">I know in Missouri v. Jenkins the second question was whether the tax increase ordered by the district court in the school desegregation case violated Federal-State comity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.448" offset="9439888">The first question was whether the remedy was too broad, and when the State tried to argue that it violated Federal-State comity because the remedy was too broad, this Court indicated that that wouldn't be within the scope of the grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.701" offset="9492969">I think in this case when the village argues that Mrs. Olech's specific amended complaint failed to sufficiently allege that there was not a rational basis related to a legitimate government interest, that doesn't go to whether the Equal Protection Clause protects a class of one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.020" offset="9570187">That falls within question 2, whether this particular amended complaint meets the standard to state a cause of action for violation of the Equal Protection Clause, assuming that that clause protects such individuals.</text>

Zimmer and Phyllis S. Zimmer differently from other property owners in the Village of Willowbrook by demanding the 33-foot easements and the 66-foot dedicated street as a condition of the extension of the water main because of the ill will generated by the State court lawsuit, and in an attempt to control storm water drainage in the vicinity to the detriment of plaintiff Grace Olech and Thaddeus Olech and other plaintiffs in the State court lawsuit by the use of ditches and swales along Tennessee Avenue.</text>

            <text syncTime="3440.899" offset="13905677">That's right, although I think in this case that's not what we have, since I've alleged both, and the allegations of the complaint have to be accepted as true at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.666" offset="13952802">Briefly, with respect to exhaustion of remedies, that's another question which I believe is not properly before the Court for a number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.005" offset="13986135">It was not ever mentioned prior to the brief on the merits by the village.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.655" offset="14012779">It was not mentioned in the district court, where I could have amended the complaint if there was a technical deficiency, and also, even if Your Honors intend to address the exhaustion of remedies issue, I believe the Court has already held at least two times that one need not exhaust his State remedies in order to state a claim for a denial of the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.213" offset="14111000">And on this rationally related argument, what this really comes down to is whether it was rationally related to a legitimate State interest for Willowbrook to demand private property rights of Mrs. Olech and the other plaintiffs in the State court case as a condition of receiving running water when those rights were not demanded of others as a condition of receiving running water, and where the private property rights were not required for installation and maintenance of the water main.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.019" offset="14230223">That's what the complaint says, and I think that question really answers itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.341" offset="14251539">There's not a rational basis based on the face of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.421" offset="14271810">One other point the village makes is, they argue that the road was already in existence, and that they simply desired to establish their right to maintain it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.431" offset="14355819">The complaint does not allege how wide the road is, and since it's not in the record I'm not going to state how wide it is, but I think if that's a significant fact the inference should be drawn in favor of the plaintiff that the road is substantially narrower than the 66-foot road that they were demanding be put in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.732" offset="14449024">So I'd like to thank the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.038" offset="14470236">In conclusion, I believe that the Equal Protection Clause applies to everybody, whether they're a member of a class or group or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.294" offset="14503255">It certainly applies to Mrs. Olech.</text>
