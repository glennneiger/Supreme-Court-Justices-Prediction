            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="150429">We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 98-9349, Steven Dewayne Bond v. The United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.505" offset="188359">Ms. Fuentes.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="m_carolyn_fuentes" startTime="10.728" stopTime="124.213">
            <label>Ms. M. Carolyn Fuentes</label>
            <text syncTime="10.728" offset="193270">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:--</text>
            <text syncTime="15.467" offset="212287">Mr. Bond's case presents the question whether a search occurs for purposes of the Fourth Amendment when a law enforcement officer manipulates a bus passenger's carry on luggage to determine its contents.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.111" offset="262860">If manipulation of luggage is not a search, then law officers will be able to squeeze and feel carry on luggage, as Agent Cantu did in Mr. Bond's case, free from judicial scrutiny in criminal cases and without any Fourth Amendment requirement that their actions be reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.676" offset="337048">Over 30 years ago, in Terry v. Ohio, this Court said that it is sheet torture of the English language to suggest that a careful exploration all over the outer clothing of a person's body is not a search.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.464" offset="400264">The same can be said in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.494" offset="408310">The principles in Terry, as well as those in Dickerson v. Minnesota, govern this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.769" offset="437462">Now, the Government says that they do not and says, instead, this Court's public exposure cases govern the determination in Mr. Bond's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.934" offset="474138">The flaw in the Government's argument is that it fails to recognize that on the line between Dickerson and Terry on the one hand and the public exposure cases on the other, Mr. Bond's case falls far closer to the facts, circumstances, and legal principles in Dickerson and in Terry.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.286" offset="555536">For example, Terry and Dickerson involved searches of outer clothing being worn by a person.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.508" offset="580405">Outer clothing, the pockets of outer clothing in particular, serve the function of being a repository of personal effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.858" offset="609766">We commonly carry our personal effects on our clothing, in our pockets.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.864" offset="625858">A travel bag, like the one Mr. Bond carried, serves the same function.</text>

            <text syncTime="124.213" offset="647278">But the difference... the difference, Ms. Fuentes, if there is one, I mean, the difference asserted, is whether there's a reasonable expectation of privacy, and you do have a reasonable expectation of privacy in your clothing.</text>

            <text syncTime="155.896" offset="773920">We think that Mr. Bond did have a reasonable expectation of privacy in his luggage, and he had a reasonable expectation to be free from a Government tactile examination of that luggage.</text>

            <text syncTime="168.377" offset="823866">Did he have a reasonable expectation other passengers would not be able to feel the luggage and see what was in it?</text>

            <text syncTime="175.551" offset="852600">He reasonably expected that other passengers might push or move the luggage if they needed to make room for their own, but that is not what Agent Cantu did.</text>

            <text syncTime="191.742" offset="917384">When we get on a bus and we put our luggage overhead, the expectation is that if another passenger needs to come aboard and needs room in that luggage bin, maybe he will push it, maybe he will pull it, I think maybe he could squeeze it.</text>

            <text syncTime="207.387" offset="979973">Let's analogize it to the situation where you leave your window shades up.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.579" offset="1000662">Now, you don't expect your neighbors to peek into your room, but you don't have a reasonable expectation of privacy, and the police are entitled to observe what is going on in the room if you leave the shades up, isn't that right?</text>

            <label>Ms. M. Carolyn Fuentes</label>
            <text syncTime="3348.756" offset="13545394">I think overall, Your Honor, the... all of the Government's argument is based on the knowing exposure of Mr. Bond's bag, and those cases that this Court has decided on knowing exposure vary so radically from Mr. Bond's situation that they should not be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.859" offset="13633792">That public exposure principle has been applied primarily for visual observations with very limited exceptions, the garbage case, for example, and luggage is different than garbage, and I believe Maryland v. Macon, where police officers went into a store where people were invited to buy, and they bought.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.356" offset="13707771">So they touched it, they bought, they did just what the public could do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.234" offset="13719265">But on that line, what happened to Mr. Bond was much closer to Dickerson and to Terry, and so the public exposure principle should not be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.856" offset="13753851">Instead, the limited public access principles in Mancuson v. DeForte, for example, just because other people have access to our office doesn't mean that the police can have access, those principles, as well as Dickerson and Terry, are more applicable in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.378" offset="13815918">I also wanted to say one thing about purpose, and that is that purpose can be instructive if it is manifested by objective actions, and that purpose is what helps to define reasonable expectations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.883" offset="13873910">We do expect that other passengers may move our luggage for the purpose of making room for their own, and when their actions go beyond that, our reasonable expectations of privacy are violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.458" offset="13920199">More than 30 years ago, in Terry, this Court had to decide whether it wanted to isolate an entire range of police conduct from Fourth Amendment constraints, and really much the same question is before the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.636" offset="13972966">Will the police be permitted to manipulate luggage basically as much as they want under the Government's theory?</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.732" offset="14005253">If anything could have been observed by a member of the public, then the police are entitled to observe it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.018" offset="14022494">Will they be able to do that outside the constraints of the Fourth Amendment, and I think the answer should be no.</text>

            <text syncTime="3479.564" offset="14068679">Maybe it is harder, but the real question's just whether, when you put this luggage up in a place, you have a reasonable expectation that somebody could go and feel the brick, and if the answer's yes, then he has no expectation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.580" offset="14124685">The answer's no, he does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.965" offset="14130223">All right, now, on that theory the only way... the answer must be yes, there's a good chance somebody would feel the brick unless it requires a special hard touch, all right?</text>

            <text syncTime="3508.624" offset="14184871">Well, I think the answer is, the reason they will do it is to move their luggage, and your expectations would be violated if it were an empty bus and someone came and started touching your luggage anyway, and when our reasonable expectations of privacy are violated by private persons, that doesn't matter for Fourth Amendment purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.522" offset="14264493">But when the Government does it, and Agent Cantu did it in this case, that is covered by the Fourth Amendment, and unless it is done with some sort of individualized suspicion, it is a violation of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
