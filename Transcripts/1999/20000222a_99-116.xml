            <text syncTime="165.689" offset="803487">So, I suppose it follows from what you're saying that the statute would never have any application to a Medicare or Medicaid... a government that gives money to a Medicare or Medicaid provider in... under its contract obligations.</text>

            <text syncTime="186.090" offset="885094">And the reason is that... that the Medicare system as seen in... in the legislation and in the Code of Federal Regulation makes clear that the providers are simply providing a service.</text>

            <text syncTime="205.218" offset="961685">Well, but in a way the benefit goes to the provider as well because we're dealing here with Medicare services by a hospital when they weren't getting paid anything for people who couldn't afford to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.115" offset="1017273">So, Medicare was enacted, and now all of a sudden, a hospital can get paid for doing something that it was getting saddled with without pay before.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.886" offset="1052277">And in a sense, the hospital benefits.</text>

            <text syncTime="242.779" offset="1111837">And benefits in the sense of a noun in the sense of what... in looking at the legislative history, the Del Toro, Hinton, and Mosley cases and which arose and why Congress passed this law before the Dixson case sort of reigned those in, those three cases all involved the administration of assets of the Federal Government through a surrogate.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.084" offset="1209117">And if we take the contention of the Government, that is, assistance payments and those who assist... receive assistance payments is the test, then I think Congress would have said that.</text>

            <text syncTime="300.369" offset="1342237">It sounds... I mean, the immediate... most immediate reading of that language says, oh, whatever the... whatever the organization gets under the grant, program, subsidy, and so on, is... is what the statute is referring to as a benefit because that's the only kind of benefit that... that organizations get.</text>

            <text syncTime="339.802" offset="1500016">There's no... once that hospital is paid for these services, it's no longer accountable for how it spends its money, nor does the Federal Government have any interest in how it spends its money.</text>
