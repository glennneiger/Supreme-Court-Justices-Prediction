            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="3.982" offset="100242">I have the opinion to announce in Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, No. 98-963.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.742" offset="135247">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.801" offset="155518">The suit in this case was brought by respondents Shrink Missouri Government PAC, a political action committee, and Fredman, a candidate for the 1998 Republican nomination for Missouri State Auditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.980" offset="204210">They alleged that the First and Fourteenth Amendments were violated by a Missouri statute that imposes limits ranging from $275 to $1,075 on contributions to candidates for state offices.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.842" offset="263664">The District Court sustained the statute but the Eighth Circuit reversed, holding that under our 1976 decision in Buckley v. Valeo, Missouri had failed to demonstrate a requisite compelling interest in the limits, it failed to make a necessary evidentiary showing of problems resulting from contributions in amounts in excess of those permitted by the statute, and it failed to show that the statute was closely enough tailored to serve the interest claimed by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.603" offset="382678">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.472" offset="398247">Although, Buckley deals with federal contribution limits and federal candidates, it is authority for comparable state limits on contributions to state candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.652" offset="434923">Under Buckley a contribution limit involving significant interference with associational rights, survive scrutiny if the government demonstrates that regulating contributions is a means closely drawn to match an important interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.150" offset="492915">The Missouri statute is adequately tied to an important state interest, Buckley found that the prevention of corruption and the appearance of corruption was a constitutionally sufficient justification for the contribution limits at issue, in that case, Missouri espouses the same interest and there can be no serious question about their legitimacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.158" offset="572954">Likewise, the Missouri statute enjoys adequate evidentiary support which we cover in our opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.990" offset="596256">This case does not present a close call requiring further definition of a state's evidentiary obligation beyond what Buckley indicates.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.441" offset="630110">Finally, there is no indication here that the Missouri limits have had an effective suppressing in the political speech necessary for an adequate campaign of workable political association, and thus there is no showing that the limitation prevented effective political advocacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.030" offset="696461">Respondents argue that Buckley set a nominal minimum $1,000 constitutional threshold for contribution limits, which in dollars adjusted for loss of purchasing power is now well above even the $1,000 line drawn by Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.075" offset="764589">This argument is a fundamental misunderstanding of Buckley.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.960" offset="780158">There we specifically rejected the contention that $1,000, or any other particular amount was a constitutional minimum, instead we asked whether the contribution limitation was so low as to impede the ability of candidates to amass the resources necessary for effective advocacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.288" offset="857480">Justice Stevens has filed a concurring opinion; Justice Breyer has filed a concurring opinion in which Justice Ginsburg joins; Justice Kennedy has filed a dissenting opinion; Justice Thomas has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Scalia joins.</text>
