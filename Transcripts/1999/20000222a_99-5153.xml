            <text syncTime="2555.510" offset="10368901">And so, this is... this is the experience that Congress has looked to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.770" offset="10381857">Similarly, under the old probation statute, the statute said that the district court may revoke an offender's probation and order to... him to serve any sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.430" offset="10420519">And it was recognized that the majority of the courts had certainly held that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.722" offset="10437760">What... when... once the district court revoked an offender's probation, it could order him to serve another term of probation.</text>
