            <text syncTime="13.448" offset="209026">The Colorado statute at issue here, 18-9-122, section 3, converts protected speech into a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.554" offset="241522">The statute, which can be found at page 64a and 65a of the petition appendix, the last two pages, imposes an 8-foot floating bubble zone around every person who passes within a 100-foot radius of every entrance door to every health care facility in the State of Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.501" offset="305261">Within that floating bubble zone, the statute criminalizes a knowing approach made for the purposes of engaging in constitutionally protected speech unless prior consent is obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.076" offset="347579">The consent provision alone invalidates the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.153" offset="359909">It makes the peaceful distribution of a leaflet, the display of a sign, and even specific oral communications in a traditional public forum a crime if prior consent is not obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.194" offset="404004">The statute targets only constitutionally protected speech.</text>

            <text syncTime="211.770" offset="1002312">I said that a person standing on the sidewalk, as the woman approaches, if the person stands still, the person doesn't have to do anything even if the woman comes within 6 inches.</text>

            <text syncTime="259.767" offset="1194365">This statute actually combines the floating zone of Schenck with the no-approach zone that the Court prohibited in Madsen.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.407" offset="1216934">So, if you're going to enter within 8-feet of a person, if you're not there first... in other words, if you stand still, sure, you don't violate it, just like in Madsen.</text>
