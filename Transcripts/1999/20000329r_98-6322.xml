            <text syncTime="160.405" offset="776538">I would say that the motion for a certificate of appealability addressed to the court of appeals in Hohn, and in this case, elevates the case that is in the district court into the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.164" offset="831604">That is a case that is at that point ending in the court of appeals, but it's not a case that's different or separate from the case that's in the district court.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael Pescetta</label>
            <text syncTime="254.036" offset="1151030">Exactly, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.019" offset="1158971">Mr. Slack's case was pending in the district court at the time the AEDPA was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.882" offset="1186452">That case didn't go away.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.165" offset="1195542">It didn't transmute in some way.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.995" offset="1202857">It's the same case that went to the court of appeals on our motion for a certificate of probable cause because, of course, since this was a pre AEDPA case, we asked under the old law for a certificate of probable cause, and not a certificate of appealability, and we entered the court of appeals with that case in the same way that if we had prevailed in the court below and the State had appealed to the court of appeals, the notice of appeal would have vested jurisdiction in the court of appeals over this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.147" offset="1339529">The case hasn't changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.600" offset="1349351">Now, the point I think that was being focused on in Hohn was whether there was anything pending in the court of appeals on the motion for a certificate of appealability in that case, and this Court said yes, that's correct, and it's our position that our case, the case that was pending at the time the AEDPA was enacted, did vest jurisdiction in the court of appeals to decide whether to bring that case up by granting a certificate of appealability, and it's the same case that's before this Court on the propriety of the court of appeals' denial of that certificate of appealability... certificate of probable cause.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael Pescetta</label>
            <text syncTime="354.231" offset="1551853">Yes, Your Honor, because at no point in the prior proceedings in the district court or in the court of appeals, or in this Court until the argument in the fall, did the respondent State ever say that any portion of the AEDPA applied to this case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="371.734" stopTime="386.124">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="371.734" offset="1621861">Well, haven't a number of courts of appeal treated those two things just interchangeably?</text>
            <text syncTime="380.839" offset="1658223">They've treated certificates of probable cause as certificates of appealability.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_pescetta" startTime="386.124" stopTime="483.327">
            <label>Mr. Michael Pescetta</label>
            <text syncTime="386.124" offset="1679435">Only because the courts of appeals have uniformly... have not uniformly, but in the main treated the... or, the substantive requirements for certificate of appealability as the same as those for a certificate of probable cause and if, as we argue in the second part of our argument, that all the certificate of appealability was intended by Congress to do, which was the only position asserted by the proponents of the legislation, was to adopt the Barefoot standard, then it's purely a question of terminology, terminology and, of course, the specification of issues provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.416" offset="1824571">But I would submit that the State can't rely on any defect either in the specification of issues provision, or in whether we call this a certificate of appealability or a certificate of probable cause, because we asked the district court for a certificate of probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.639" offset="1893430">Issue was joined under pre AEDPA law.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.009" offset="1906909">The court of appeals denied the certificate of probable cause under pre AEDPA law, and this Court granted certiorari on our petition under pre AEDPA law, and the question of whether any portion of the AEDPA would apply to this case was injected into this case by the State Attorney General amici, who claimed that there was a jurisdictional problem under section 2253.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.390" offset="2028431">But our position is simply that Lindh controls this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.802" offset="2042119">Our case was pending at the time the AEDPA was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.735" offset="2061867">There's no dispute about that.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="483.327" stopTime="559.376">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="483.327" offset="2068241">Well, what Lindh held was essentially that there is no retroactivity provision in section 153, and therefore the normal rules of nonretroactivity apply, and the normal rules of nonretroactivity for a statute that sets forth the substantive requirements for habeas would not apply that statute to any cases that were filed already when the statute was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.944" offset="2234693">But the normal rules of retroactivity do not apply uniformly to every matter governed by a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.490" offset="2268862">I mean, you might have in the same statute the alteration of the substantive requirements for a crime, okay, the alterations of the requirements for filing a lawsuit, and the alteration of evidentiary requirements in the course of a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.010" offset="2342945">Now, what would constitute a retroactive application of each one of those three is quite different.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael Pescetta</label>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="563.029" offset="2387040">That's right, and what Lindh involved was the substantive requirements for habeas, and it said this would be retroactive if you applied the new substantive requirements to a case already filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.187" offset="2439702">But it's an entirely different question as to whether requirements concerning the requirements for appeal are being applied retroactively so long as you apply them to cases that are not yet on appeal, and I think that's what's going on here, and it seems to me not at all contrary to Lindh to say that the requirements for appealing are governed by the new law.</text>

            <text syncTime="601.043" offset="2539072">Your Honor, my understanding of Justice Souter's opinion for the Court in Lindh was that we have these two chapters, 154 and 153.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.180" offset="2583689">By clearly mandating that the chapter 154, the opt in provisions, apply to cases pending at the time of the act, the negative, the strong negative inference arose that the chapter 153 provisions and the amendments to section 2253 and the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure are in chapter 153, don't.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="639.308" offset="2692150">And I think the reason it said generally was because some of those provisions do not deal with the initial substantive requirements for getting relief, but deal to such matters as what are the conditions for appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.477" offset="2740842">That's why it said generally.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael Pescetta</label>
            <text syncTime="653.217" offset="2747738">Respectfully, Your Honor, I think that there is a different explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.850" offset="2762367">The opt in provisions are not stand alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.213" offset="2775742">They do not have the, for instance, the review provisions of section 2254(d), which were in the chapter 153 amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.448" offset="2808760">They don't have the separate appeal section.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.629" offset="2817433">And it's our view of what Lindh intended to hold by that use of the word, generally, was that anything that falls within the opt in provisions that are covered by chapter 154, take along with them the general provisions that were enacted by the AEDPA as to those cases which qualify for the opt in treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.503" offset="2904891">I'd emphasize Mr. Slack's case is not only a nonopt in case, it's not a capital case, and so under those circumstances, if you are in the opt in world, all of the amendments to both chapter 153 and 154 would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.255" offset="2967898">But if you're not under chapter 154 there, I think, is no basis for saying that the chapter 153 amendments which apply to everybody else apply to a case pending, which Mr. Slack's case clearly was at the time the AEDPA was enacted.</text>

            <text syncTime="1829.969" offset="7454795">It is indeed Nevada's position, consistent with the Eighth Circuit ruling upon which we rely and cite in our brief, Teeterman v. Benson, that the changes to section 2253 regarding certificates of appealability apply to the appeal in this case, which was initiated after the effective date, April 24, 1996.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.556" offset="7553120">In fact, the claims at issue which were the subject of the district court's dismissal and the circuit court's review, were filed after the effective date of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.273" offset="7600035">In Teeterman, the Eighth Circuit, speaking to a question that Justice Scalia just asked, noted that while in Lindh this Court held that the changes generally didn't apply to the substantive issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.705" offset="7661789">It indicated that the Court could think of no reason why a new provision exclusively directed toward appeal procedures would depend for its effective date on the filing of a case in a trial court instead of on the filing of a notice of appeal or similar document and, thus, it held in the 1997 ruling that AEDPA does apply and that the COA provisions apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.737" offset="7757815">Subsequent, the Hohn case also came to this Court out of the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.831" offset="7774220">That was a 2255 case in which initially the petitioner challenged the way the Federal statute had been applied to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.709" offset="7813717">At some point in time in the litigation, after he appealed, the Government conceded that it was not merely a constitutional or, excuse me, a statutory issue, but, rather, a issue of constitutional dimension and ultimately, as this Court knows, the Hohn case ended up here for its determination on the limited issue regarding whether it could review the denial of the COA.</text>

            <text syncTime="2760.217" offset="11175781">--I understand that to be their argument, and I think it's a good one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.779" offset="11194067">However, it does not necessarily seem to go as far as what the word constitutional means under the statute, and that is, of course, the question that the Court has asked us to try to speak to and, unfortunately, there aren't... there isn't a lot of case law, and the case law that is out there has been cited by both sides, the Teeterman case being the one on which we primarily rely from the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.169" offset="11315588">In briefly addressing the other question that this Court had asked the parties to look at, and that is the change to the actual statute itself, that is, the abuse of the writ statute, we have submitted our assertion that the abuse of the writ statute in this case, the application of the new statute frankly would make no major difference in the outcome compared to the old statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.859" offset="11498341">And particularly the application of Rule 9(b) you asked the question, Justice Stevens, what should happen, and the Solicitor General answered that this Court could revert to the first question that was posed and decide whether it was of continuing import.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.020" offset="11563020">We suggest that it is of continuing import, certainly in our jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.422" offset="11584649">There was an assertion that there were very few cases, or will be very few cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.857" offset="11610354">I can tell you there are many in our jurisdiction, and particularly from the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.062" offset="11639193">You may recall the assertion in the brief that the Ninth Circuit has adopted what we colloquially call the parking lot procedure, whereby they treat pre AEDPA filings dating back to the early 1990's as actual filings, merely where prisoners sought the appointment of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.268" offset="11724039">Those... many cases are still pending, and frankly may not even get back into the Federal district courts where they have been, quote unquote, parked, and it is in that context that I say the first question that you all... that we argued in the fall is of continuing importance.</text>

            <text syncTime="2915.727" offset="11797809">Mr. Sarnowski, can I ask you about your interpretation of 2253?</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.131" offset="11815467">Like Justice O'Connor, I'm inclined to think that the underlying... if the underlying claim is a denial of a constitutional right, it may suffice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.958" offset="11858726">It seems to me the strongest argument against that, and I haven't heard you assert it... maybe I should have asked this question of the Solicitor General, but it seems to me the strongest argument against it is, if you do look to the underlying claim and say, has there been a substantial showing in the underlying claim that a constitutional right was denied, it seems to me then, even if the procedural ground from which appeal is immediately sought is entirely clear, even though there's not much of a doubt about the correctness of the procedural ruling, you would have to... you would have to allow appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.660" offset="12053600">I don't see... in other words, I don't see how the Solicitor General gets the second half of his interpretation of 2253(c)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.667" offset="12105635">The first half he says is that you look to see whether the underlying claim is a substantial showing of a denial of a constitutional right, but, he says, if the procedural ruling was, you know, rolling off a log, there's no doubt about its correctness, you don't get a certificate of appealability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.581" offset="12189227">I don't see how we can impose that latter condition.</text>

            <label>Mr. David F. Sarnowski</label>
            <text syncTime="3017.444" offset="12204692">Well, in that regard, and the State's last brief, the amicus brief authored by California, I believe speaks to it, in that if you note the language of 2253 subsection (c)(1)(A) it requires, or it allows an appeal to be taken to the court of appeals only upon the final order in a habeas case, and the question then becomes, what is the court reviewing, or the higher court, if you will, what is it going to review?</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.207" offset="12343768">In this instance, there was a written ruling which is contained in the joint appendix in this case, which basically outlines what the petitioner said his claims were at various times, and the court's conclusion that they were either unexhausted or abusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.737" offset="12405835">The lower court ruling, the order itself, the final order is totally devoid of any discussion of the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.813" offset="12434151">So then you would have the higher, intermediate appellate court reaching down to try to figure out what was in terms of the merits of the underlying claims, what they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.060" offset="12487128">In many instances, you don't have that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3090.182" offset="12495696">Well, I guess... could you argue that just the introductory phrase of (c)(1), unless a circuit justice or judge issued a certificate of appealability an appeal may not be taken, and maybe implicit in that is that they wouldn't issue a certificate of appealability unless they thought that the ruling was... you know, was close?</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.187" offset="12583676">Could you say it's implicit in that language?</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael Pescetta</label>
            <text syncTime="3141.425" offset="12700600">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.557" offset="12705198">There's a thread in this Court's statutory interpretations cases that's expressed in Justice Kennedy's opinion for the Court in Hohn, Justice Souter's opinion for the Court in Jones v. United States, that's expressed in many other cases, that we do not... it is not reasonable to assume that Congress intended a major change in practice without making that intent clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.482" offset="12804881">What the State's position on the scope of the certificate of appealability is that without any indication, any discussion, Congress intended by enacting section 2253 to erect an entirely one sided system of review of procedural errors in habeas cases in the Federal court, and the idea that Congress would have done that, would have imposed on this Court and on the courts of appeals the burden of regulating district court procedural rulings in habeas cases by extraordinary writ, simply is not reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.897" offset="12950540">The substantiality question that's been raised by the argument of the Solicitor General as to the substantiality of the underlying claim, we have to remember, Mr. Slack has never gotten a hearing, has never had any proceedings on the substantiality of his underlying claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.208" offset="13019712">All we have is a procedural ruling covering allegations which for the purpose of a motion to dismiss have to be taken as true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.403" offset="13052522">It's our position that if the procedural ruling covers allegations of a substantial constitutional claim, then the procedural ruling has to be reviewable, otherwise we have a monstrosity of a statute which is replicated in no other area of the law, where one side has the right to have procedural errors reviewed and the other doesn't.</text>

            <text syncTime="3257.312" offset="13164117">--I don't necessarily... well, I think the problem with the historical practice... the short answer is yes, I would agree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.089" offset="13203301">The problem is, because of the predominance of procedural issues in habeas practice, the practice has developed that we focus on the procedural issue as the grounds for denying the COA... rather, the CPC, and the underlying merits of the constitutional claims are assumed because, for the purpose of a motion to dismiss, they have to be taken as true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.511" offset="13288982">Third, there is no change, as it has been expressed, from Federal to constitutional in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.867" offset="13318344">The law before the adoption of the AEDPA was Barefoot, which used substantial showing of a denial of a Federal right, but which also used terms like, questions of some substance, issues debatable among jurists of reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.408" offset="13388561">It's our position that Congress, in a number of bills which indiscriminately used the term Federal right or constitutional right, was trying to do one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.824" offset="13426178">It was simply trying to adopt the Barefoot standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.146" offset="13439552">It was not 100 percent clear, as many things in the AEDPA are not 100 percent clear, but there is not a shred of evidence in the record before this Court, or in all of the proceedings before Congress, that the congressional intent was anything else.</text>
