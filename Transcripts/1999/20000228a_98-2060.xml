            <text syncTime="48.502" offset="324227">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This habeas case is about the need for an explanation when a defendant misses his opportunity in State court to assert ineffective assistance of appellate counsel in order to reopen his original direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.384" offset="403744">The Sixth Circuit here held that no such explanation is necessary before a Federal court in effect may reopen the appeal, but that holding is serious error, because it undermines the State's ability to have the reopened appeal occur in the same court that heard the original appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.664" offset="488903">To put the matter more concretely, respondent here is seeking Federal habeas relief on the ground that his guilty plea was invalid but he didn't raise that claim in his original direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.291" offset="543447">He asserts as cause for that default ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, but he defaults in his ineffective assistance claim as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.158" offset="582839">The State permits a defendant to raise ineffective assistance in order to revive a claim originally defaulted on direct appeal, here, the underlying plea-related claim, but respondent did not take advantage of that opportunity in State court in a timely manner under State law, and our position is that his failure to do so requires an explanation before the Federal court can revive that defaulted claim, the plea claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="245.654" offset="1112812">Now, that's a very complicated question, but I guess that's what the district court went on here, didn't it, and anyway, what do we do with that?</text>

            <text syncTime="268.832" offset="1205598">In 1992, after the Ohio supreme court decided that Murnahan decision, that decision makes it clear how to bring that claim, and he could have brought it in 1992, after that decision, and he had counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="334.992" offset="1470167">One, he says that's an obstacle to this Court reaching the question in the petitioner for certiorari, and that's incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.640" offset="1500782">The question that we raised in the cert petition is properly before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.800" offset="1517396">It was the question decided by the Sixth Circuit, and it was the question that respondent, indeed, asked the Sixth Circuit to decide, and it was respondent's view in the Sixth Circuit that you didn't need to address the adequacy issue and instead decide--</text>

            <text syncTime="358.822" offset="1565566">Mr. Foley, do you know whether respondent, in its brief in opposition to certiorari, made that point?</text>

            <text syncTime="366.102" offset="1594614">--I do know the answer to that, and respondent did not object in the opposition to certiorari on that ground, in effect recognizing that the question was properly presented, suggesting that it wasn't worthy of the Court's review.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.595" offset="1648635">So to answer your question, Justice Ginsburg, the question the Sixth Circuit decided is properly here.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.827" offset="1677579">Now, respondent also raises the adequacy issue as an alternative ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.118" offset="1698686">Our view is that that should be remanded, because the Sixth Circuit didn't reach it, but if this Court does reach that issue as an alternative ground, we think the Court should reject it as without merit because, as I was suggesting, for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.408" offset="1751871">First, he had multiple opportunities to raise his ineffective assistance claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.056" offset="1774441">He could have raised it at three different times in 3 different years, and the State court ground was that he missed all those opportunities, and secondly, Justice Breyer, in response to your question about the district court's reasoning, the district court's view was that the good cause standard in Ohio law was, there was some variation--</text>

            <text syncTime="431.659" offset="1856883">Your answer to Justice Ginsburg resolves my question.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edward_b_foley" startTime="435.286" stopTime="572.998">
            <label>Mr. Edward B. Foley</label>
            <text syncTime="435.286" offset="1871407">--Okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.368" offset="1875692">Turning, then, to the question that the Sixth Circuit decided, our position is that the Sixth Circuit was wrong, because the State's interest here is to have the plea claim, the originally defaulted claim, heard in the forum that it should have been heard in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.433" offset="1955940">The allegation here is that it would have been heard in that forum but for ineffective assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.662" offset="1988854">If that's true, then what the State wants to do is to rectify that constitutional violation by restoring that plea claim to the forum that it should have been in the first place, but the Sixth Circuit's view frustrates the State's effort to get that claim back into the forum in which it belongs if the Federal court is permitted to entertain that plea claim without any showing of why the defendant, respondent here, did not take advantage of the State court opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.134" offset="2122810">The State has a process for raising ineffectiveness claims to reopen a direct appeal, and what the Sixth Circuit does is, it substitutes the Federal court for that process.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.876" offset="2165755">It makes the Federal court engage in exactly the same reopening process, because as the Federal court hear's that underlying plea claim, and does so because it finds ineffective assistance is cause, then the Federal court is doing precisely what the State court wants to do, and the State court, as this Court's precedents make clear, the State needs to have the opportunity to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.820" offset="2265543">Now, we're not saying that just because he missed the State court deadline means that he gets no habeas review no matter what.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.441" offset="2312041">All we're asking for is that explanation, the cause and prejudice test.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.516" offset="2328341">In other words, it's our position that where the Sixth Circuit error was was in failing to run this claim through the cause and prejudice analysis that applies in all procedural default contexts.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.574" offset="2384557">That's what Coleman says.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.292" offset="2391453">It talks about the uniformity of procedural default analysis, and that uniformity should occur in this context as well.</text>

            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="591.238" offset="2495212">Then we have step 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.214" offset="2499078">You can get around the State ground by asserting cause, blocked by a different State ground, i.e., cause wasn't done right, and I suppose you could have cause for getting around State ground 2, which could be blocked by State ground three.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.244" offset="2575251">They didn't do that one right.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.046" offset="2582461">And this could go on, like Kepler's epicycles, indefinitely and no human being, let alone a petitioner without any lawyer, would ever understand what to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.105" offset="2622689">Now, the reason I put it is, it seems to me there is a separate and different way to look at it, that of course the substantive claim can be blocked by a State ground that's adequate, but the matter of cause is basically a question for the Federal judge, and that cuts through everything, says of course, with Carrier, you have to present it to the State court so they get a shot, but if they have four other State ground rules that stop it, that's their problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.350" offset="2743688">The matter of cause for getting around... the matter of, is there a State ground for not hearing the prosecutorial claim, that's up to the State, but the matter of cause for getting around it, that's up to the Federal judge, basically.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.313" offset="2799486">Now, isn't that how we handle most matters of cause, or is it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Edward B. Foley</label>
            <text syncTime="672.513" offset="2820279">--Several responses, Justice Breyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.537" offset="2832400">First, I don't think we have an infinite regress problem here because we only have two steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.452" offset="2856015">We have two defaults, and if respondent can show cause for that second default you don't have to go any further.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.670" offset="2888929">He does get habeas, Federal habeas relief if he can show cause and prejudice or actual innocence under the test, so you don't have to look for a third, or a fourth, or an infinite regress.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.825" offset="2937517">Now, as to the point about, well, yes it is true, it causes a Federal question, and there's no doubt that the cause inquiry as it applies to that underlying plea claim is a Federal question, but he has asserted ineffective assistance as that cause, and Carrier makes it plain that once he asserts ineffective assistance as the cause he has to do several things.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.694" offset="3036991">First, he has to meet the Sixth Amendment standard for ineffective assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.526" offset="3056322">It can't simply be poor lawyering that doesn't meet the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.388" offset="3071786">And secondly, he must exhaust that Sixth Amendment claim in State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.972" offset="3094147">So Carrier already tells us that when ineffectiveness is asserted as cause we have to go back into the State system and it is not sufficient... to answer the third point of your question, it's not sufficient simply to have presentment or exhaustion because, as this Court recognized unanimously last year in O'Sullivan... this was the point where there was agreement in O'Sullivan... exhaustion must be coupled with procedural default analysis, and the reason is, as this Court explained, is that procedural default doctrine protects the integrity of the exhaustion rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.380" offset="3227790">So once Carrier says that this ineffectiveness claim, the Sixth Amendment claim, the second part, which is asserted as cause for the underlying plea claim, once that has been raised it has to go back to State court not just for presentment but for proper presentment, and that's why procedural default analysis must apply to both claims, the plea claim and the ineffectiveness claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.449" offset="3332070">The Sixth Circuit held to the contrary, and that's why it was erroneous.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="805.062" offset="3350461">Is one way, then, to state the difference between the parties in this case that the difference is one of the definition of exhaustion, that he... that the respondent concedes there has to be exhaustion, but he defines it just in terms of presentment, whereas you agree there has to be exhaustion, but you say exhaustion must be a proper presentment.</text>

            <text syncTime="835.249" offset="3471251">Well, we definitely believe there must be proper presentment, and we think that's the procedural default requirement, because exhaustion would be satisfied if a State like Missouri... which has a strict 90-day deadline, no exceptions whatsoever... exhaustion would be satisfied on day 91 no matter what the reason for the default.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.281" offset="3567381">On day 91, we know as a matter of the exhaustion doctrine there's no further State remedy, but that's not proper presentment, and that doesn't give the State court the opportunity to pass on the claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="1661.191" offset="6775009">Mr. LaGrand waived both his merit claim and his cause argument, and therefore there was technically nothing for this Court to review.</text>

            <text syncTime="1680.924" offset="6853899">If there were no merit claims and no cause arguments presented to this Court, the Court never could have reached that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.908" offset="6877827">Just last term, though, in Strickler v. Greene, the Court dealt with a similar structural argument with respect to a defaulted Brady claim, and in that case the Court held that a defaulted Brady claim and a defaulted cause argument could nevertheless be considered, even though the cause arguments themselves were not properly presented to a State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.492" offset="6972181">The same analysis should apply here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1715.676" offset="6992975">He presented his cause claims, fully exhausted them, and did not procedurally default them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.042" offset="7014395">It is immaterial at that point whether or not he must present cause in prejudice arguments if his cause argument itself, the second one, is not procedurally defaulted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.338" offset="7059639">Justice Breyer, you asked a question earlier about the perpetual abyss that we can get into with respect to these questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.767" offset="7089314">That's exactly what the Court dealt with in Strickler v. Greene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.503" offset="7108227">No matter how many times that question was asked, the answer to why was the Brady claim defaulted was always the same answer: because the State withheld evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.455" offset="7148038">There's only one way to get out of that loop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.020" offset="7158278">Either go to the merits of that claim, or continue asking the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.940" offset="7173951">We assert, or argue, that this Court did the correct thing by not continually asking cause questions when the Court can go straight to the merits of the claim and resolve it at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.122" offset="7222748">Now, ineffective assistance of counsel is very similar to a Brady claim, because those claims both ask two fundamental questions: Is there State conduct that must be attributed to the individual petitioner and, if so, has the petitioner been prejudiced because of that State conduct?</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.583" offset="7292547">If a Brady claim can be reached even though the cause arguments are themselves defaulted, then so should an ineffectiveness claim be reached when the answer is always ineffective assistance of counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="2586.147" offset="10474784">A few brief points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.230" offset="10487114">First of all, in response to Justice Breyer, one of your questions, the ineffectiveness claim is not an independent basis for relief, given the current posture that the case is in, so if the Sixth Circuit view were to prevail it could only be... the only habeas relief that could be granted would be on the plea claim, so they can't assert the Sixth Amendment ineffectiveness claim without proceeding under a different track, because under the Sixth Circuit track only the plea claim is--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2624.675" stopTime="2633.241">
            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="2624.675" offset="10628906">But even under the Sixth Circuit's view, if I understand it, there would have to be established that it was a Federal constitutional violation of the plea agreement, not merely that it violated Ohio law.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edward_b_foley" startTime="2633.241" stopTime="2801.059" flagged="true">
            <label>Mr. Edward B. Foley</label>
            <text syncTime="2633.241" offset="10663179">--Absolutely correct, and also, just to reiterate, we don't want to concede in any way that there was a violation of Ohio law, and in fact the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit remanded for some further proceeding on this waiver issue, so we want to preserve that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.267" offset="10743323">I thought I heard Mr. Bodine say... make the argument that was also in his brief that exhaustion's enough in the Ohio context, as opposed to the Missouri example that I gave you where there's a strict 90-day deadline, because... well, because the Ohio court could have passed on the claim because it has a limited narrow safety valve, and the only point I'd like to make beyond what's in our brief is that there shouldn't be any penalty for a State to have a limited safety valve of that kind and, indeed, in the Engle case that I mentioned earlier, this Court explicitly rejected the idea that cause in prejudice analysis does not apply in that context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.129" offset="10910715">The same kind of argument was made, namely, don't do cause in prejudice analysis, where Ohio had another very narrow safety valve, and this Court explicitly rejected that argument, so I think that takes care of that issue as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.846" offset="10965677">Mr. Bodine mentioned the Strickler case, the Brady case, as an example where a constitutional violation can be its own cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.505" offset="11012279">That is true in the Brady context, and it may in some fact patterns be true in the ineffective assistance context, and we don't dispute that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.510" offset="11052299">Again, all we're asking for here is that the cause inquiry take place, and there may be an example in a different case where you can use ineffective assistance as its own cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.286" offset="11099424">We don't think that's true in this case for a variety of reasons, but the only relief we're seeking from this Court is that that cause inquiry be undertaken, that an explanation be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.923" offset="11137981">And finally Justice Breyer, again, as to the distinction between the earthquake example and the Carrier situation, where it's a constitutional violation, I think Mr. Bodine covered this, but essentially the State's interest here is to rectify constitutional error, so that's why it's important that if there's an allegation that ineffective assistance infected the original State appeal, that there be an opportunity for the State to correct that error when the State has its own procedure to do so, as it does here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.507" offset="11280296">That interest doesn't apply in the earthquake context, and so all we're asking is that when a defendant doesn't take advantage of the process the State creates, that he be put to the explanation to explain why he didn't take the advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.265" offset="11331287">Thank you.</text>
