            <text syncTime="84.637" offset="478719">Although this case also arises in the thicket of habeas proceedings, I think the question that this Court posed on certiorari can be answered by answering two common-sense questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.888" offset="539636">One is, can we have a dismissal without prejudice, that is, a dismissal with some prejudice?</text>

I think we have never used the term second or successive as a term to refer to a case which is brought when the preceding history includes nothing but a dismissal without prejudice, so that as a matter of law... your strongest argument is, as a matter of law, assuming that Congress uses the terms the way this Court had been using these terms of art, the statute cannot possibly mean that this would be a second or successive petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.251" offset="1633122">If that is the case, it seems to me that your argument here is a weak one, because if ultimately what the court does on the first round is dismiss without prejudice, it can put all the caveats in that it wants to, you know, do it all this time, only one bite of the apple and so on.</text>

            <text syncTime="498.253" offset="2133106">That seems to me clearly to contemplate grounds that were not adjudicated, new and different grounds, and then says, judge, you look at the particular case, and if you find that the failure to bring those up earlier constituted an abuse, then you toss it out.</text>

            <text syncTime="517.686" offset="2210846">That's part of the res judicata component of the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.779" offset="2223281">Our position is that a second or a successive petition in the first sentence of Rule 9(b) means what this Court has always taken it to mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.724" offset="2262987">That is, a petition that's filed after a previous petition has been adjudicated on the merits in some form.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.620" offset="2290572">The remainder of that rule referred to different kinds of situations that can arise in a second or a successive petition, and if you look at the parallel provisions in section 2244(b) and former section 2244(b), it doesn't use the term, second or successive petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.052" offset="2372283">It says, when after an evidentiary hearing on the merits... and this is in page 2 of our brief, of the appendix to our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.040" offset="2412303">When, after an evidentiary hearing on the merits of a material factual issue, or after a hearing on the merits of an issue of law, a person in custody is... pursuant to a judgment of a State court has been denied by a court of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.412" offset="2469772">That is boiled down, I submit, in Rule 9(b) into a second or a successive petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.924" offset="2495790">The rest of 2244(b) tracks closely the rest of Rule 9(b), so I think those rules have to be harmonized.</text>

            <text syncTime="1245.471" offset="5122036">Now, again, when Congress legislated that no court could review a decision of a panel of a court of appeals deciding whether or not to allow the filing of a second or successive petition, it said so explicitly, and it applied equally to both parties, whether it was granted or denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.633" offset="5202703">To infer, simply from the change of the word Federal to constitutional, that Congress intended to erect a system in which the Federal appellate courts could never address anything but an error that favored the petitioner but could never address an error that favored the State would, I believe, present serious equal protection--</text>

            <text syncTime="1296.706" offset="5326941">I mean, if you can have any Federal constitutional claim reviewed, certainly the petitioner can have it reviewed if it's decided adversely to him, can he not?</text>

            <text syncTime="1322.261" offset="5429132">So the State could come into the court of appeals and say, yes, we agree, the petitioner has an absolutely meritorious constitutional claim that entitles him to relief, and the district court erred in concluding that the petitioner was 1 day late under the statute of limitations under AEDPA, when, in fact, it was 1 day early, but the court of appeals could never address that claim, because no matter how compelling the underlying claim is, no procedural issue could ever be reviewed by any Federal appellate court, and I submit that that's simply an irrational inference to make about what Congress intended by this language.</text>

            <text syncTime="3513.342" offset="14193527">The Chief Justice's opinion in that case said, we believe that respondent's fourth claim here, previously dismissed as premature, should be treated in the same manner as the claim of a petitioner who returns to a Federal habeas court after exhausting his State remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.183" offset="14256848">Later on, in both situations, the habeas petitioner did not receive an adjudication of his claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.338" offset="14281508">To hold otherwise would mean that a dismissal of a first habeas petition for technical procedural reasons would bar the prisoner from ever obtaining Federal habeas review.</text>
