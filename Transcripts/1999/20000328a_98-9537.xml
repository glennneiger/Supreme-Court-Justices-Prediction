            <text syncTime="50.909" offset="355140">This Court has held that Social Security proceedings are intended to be simple and informal, nonadversarial, nontechnical, and accessible even to the layman claimant.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.508" offset="417625">Indeed, almost half of all claimants who attend Social Security administrative hearings do not have attorney representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.163" offset="456182">This Court also noted that the Social Security Act is intended to be unusually protective of claimants.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.610" offset="489932">Consistent with congressional intent, the Social Security Administration has promulgated and created a panoply of regulations, rules, forms, and notices which embody that simplicity, that informality, and that claimant supportive process mandated by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.623" offset="578017">As conceded by the commissioner, the statute and regulations do not require that claimant specifically delineate any claims of error or specific issues when seeking review by the appeals council from an administrative law judge decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="143.655" offset="726183">There's nothing in the notice of decision that is sent to the claimant when a claim is denied that warns the claimant that if they do not delineate specific issues in their appeal they will waive that right in Federal court and, in fact, significantly, Justice Scalia, the notice of decision, the one issued in this case, contains many other warnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.279" offset="804655">It warns a claimant that if they file a new application it's not the same thing as appealing.</text>

            <text syncTime="183.507" offset="885530">But where you're dealing with a lawyer who knows the usual rule in administrative cases that you have... indeed, any case, judicial or administrative, that you have to have complained about what you're appealing, and if you don't specify what it is, you abandon it.</text>

Cisneros case, you have to look with consistency with the actual underlying congressional intent, and any applicable statutory and regulatory scheme, in determining whether exhaustion should be required at all, and issue exhaustion is part of the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies.</text>

            <text syncTime="1779.881" offset="7271111">That is, it's often said that the Supreme Court is not a court of error.</text>
