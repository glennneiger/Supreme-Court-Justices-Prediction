            <text syncTime="12.198" offset="195021">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.271" offset="207351">The Medicare Act provides a special mechanism for judicial review in section 405(d).</text>
            <text syncTime="20.536" offset="228458">The principle that governs this case is that claims that can be raised through that judicial review procedure must be.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.208" offset="255103">Section 405(h) bars efforts to circumvent that procedure by singling out particular legal issues and seeking judicial resolution before the Secretary applies those rules to the claimant in a final decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.947" offset="306094">That conclusion flows from the text of the statute and this Court's decisions in Weinburger v. Salfi, Heckler v. Ringer, and Bowen v. Michigan Academy.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.843" offset="341620">Under the Medicare Act, nursing homes that meet the Secretary's minimum health and safety requirements may voluntarily enter into contracts with the Secretary to provide services to medicare beneficiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.120" offset="386760">The Medicare Act makes the same mechanisms for administrative and then judicial review that are applicable to beneficiaries also applicable to nursing homes that have or seek to enter into those contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.417" offset="431900">In particular, section 1395cc(h) provides that any nursing facility that is dissatisfied with the determination, that does not meet the minimum health and safety requirements, and is subjected to a remedy as a result, is entitled to, first, a hearing before the Secretary under section 405(b) and, second, to judicial review of the Secretary's final decision following that hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="108.358" offset="579753">The structure of the scheme in section 405(h) specifically exclude preenforcement review.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.421" offset="599919">That comes from the language of section 405(h) in particular, the third sentence of which says that no action against the United States, the Secretary, or any employee shall be brought under the general Federal question statute, which is section 1331, to recover on a claim arising under the Medicare Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="156.181" offset="770969">As the Court noted in Weinburger v. Salfi, the Secretary typically will not address constitutional claims in the administrative proceedings, but in Salfi itself there was a facial constitutional challenge to a provision of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.690" offset="813078">Accordingly... but the Court nonetheless held that even constitutional claims, facial constitutional challenges to the statute, must be channeled through the specific review mechanism provided by the act, and that the party could not bypass that mechanism by seeking a declaratory judgment under the general Federal question statute in advance.</text>

            <text syncTime="201.462" offset="952154">The question is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.593" offset="956647">Is it possible for a provider who wants to challenge the regs as vague or beyond legal authority or what-not to carry that challenge all the way through to the point where they could be heard, i.e. to the district court and court of appeals level for that matter, this Court, without risking the possibility that if the provider loses, the provider would be terminated, or subject to termination by the Secretary as a provider.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.158" offset="1102933">Is it possible, in other words, to challenge the regulations without at the same time assuming liability for the most draconian of possible results, which is exclusion from the provider scheme?</text>

            <text syncTime="3348.899" offset="13541921">Now this claim arrives at the doorsteps of the district court vested with jurisdiction only under section 40... 405(g).</text>

            <text syncTime="3363.461" offset="13600122">Section 405(g) says it may affirm, modify, or reverse the Secretary's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.174" offset="13626976">The Secretary herself has taken the position that the district courts, sitting pursuant to section 405(g), have no fact-finding ability, that they are sitting literally as courts of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.370" offset="13671802">She took that position in a case called Grant v. Shalala.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.653" offset="13684863">It's a Third Circuit decision, and the Third Circuit sustained the Secretary's position, finding that the district courts had no fact-finding ability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.270" offset="13723315">The district court then is presented with an inadequate factual record, because the ALJ couldn't hear it, and the district court, if you read 405(g) literally, can only remand to the Secretary, that as we know from this Court's decision in the Nelconyan case, its powers to remand are very limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.197" offset="13815057">It can remand only if the claimant has presented new evidence, and by count of a rule 60 burden has to demonstrate that the new evidence didn't exist and couldn't have been presented to the Secretary, and that good cause exists for not presenting it to the Secretary on the way up through the administrative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.489" offset="13900216">So I would suggest that first of all we have the falling on the sword, then we have the futility of presenting your claim to an ALJ who won't hear it or rule on it, and then you get to a court who the Secretary has persistently maintained has very limited powers to sit merely as a court of review.</text>
