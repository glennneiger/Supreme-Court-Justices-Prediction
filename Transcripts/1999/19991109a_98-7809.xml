            <text syncTime="62.523" offset="376815">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="65.745" offset="389667">I would like to begin by making a preliminary observation, which I think is important because it bears on the overall tenor of the case, although I don't think that it affects the proper, ultimate decision of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.340" offset="468035">That is, that Mr. Martinez did represent himself at his trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.056" offset="498964">He did not, so far as the record reflects, engage in any untoward antics.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.752" offset="533759">It didn't appear that he was unruly or vitriolic or attempted to espouse a particular political position or anything like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.581" offset="577018">He was simply defending himself as a lawyer, retained or court-appointed, would have attempted to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.689" offset="617455">I mention this at the outset to, in some sense I hope, blunt the strong suggestion in the briefs of the respondent and its amici that by this Court's determining that an appellant, such as Martinez, has a right to self-representation on direct appeal, it opens up a pandora's box for all manner of... of absurdness to ensue.</text>

            <label>Mr. Ronald D. Maines</label>
            <text syncTime="197.328" offset="915982">That's correct.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Mr. Ronald D. Maines</label>
            <text syncTime="200.250" offset="927685">I will.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.851" offset="930089">There have been a series of decisions over the years, over the decades by this Court involving the right to counsel, which I urge is the basic, generic right that's in play in this case, the right to represent one's interests in an adversary setting, criminal setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.244" offset="1059656">The Court in its decisions over the years has said that there is a particular set or range or spectrum of points, stages along the way where the liberty interest of the defendant is particularly significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.910" offset="1166340">It begins at arraignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.962" offset="1174595">It ends at the point of direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.765" offset="1193821">And thus it is that the Court can find, as it did in Evitts v. Lucey, that a defendant, a criminal defendant, has a right to an attorney, a constitutional right to an attorney, on direct appeal in a State court proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.958" offset="1274591">It doesn't derive from the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.409" offset="1284309">It derives from the Due Process Clause.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="293.652" stopTime="315.187">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="293.652" offset="1301341">Well, in a sense, I thought Evitts perhaps derived from the Equal Protection Clause, that an indigent defendant have... should have the same right to an effective appeal as... as a non-indigent defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.851" offset="1358079">And since the non-indigent defendant will have an attorney, the indigent ought to be provided with one.</text>

            <label>Mr. Ronald D. Maines</label>
            <text syncTime="315.187" offset="1387440">Evitts, indeed, traced the... the rationale for the right to counsel, but it was very careful to explain that the right to counsel had a rationale which really partook of both clauses, Equal Protection and Due Process.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.874" offset="1502170">The Court was clear in Evitts to make that point.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="347.538" offset="1516903">And now... but you... you say for your claim, it doesn't depend on equal protection at all; it depends on the due process strand, or whatever you want to call it, of that decision and others.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ronald_d_maines" startTime="358.234" stopTime="432.513">
            <label>Mr. Ronald D. Maines</label>
            <text syncTime="358.695" offset="1561520">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.847" offset="1566118">And here's... here's how the argument goes, lest there be any confusion about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.791" offset="1589837">There... there is this set of cases which the Court has delineated in which the Court has said at this stage, at this stage, at this stage, from arraignment through direct appeal, appeal as of right, we deem these to be critical stages in the evolution of... of a criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.477" offset="1692655">It doesn't end at the trial, but it doesn't go on and on either.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.051" offset="1718882">It stops at direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.452" offset="1728495">Thus, for example, the Court has ruled that in discretionary appeals, a defendant is not entitled to a... a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.630" offset="1773217">A... an in... in forma pauperis party is not entitled to a lawyer on discretionary appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.587" offset="1821073">The Court has drawn the line between direct appeals of right and discretionary appeals, such as cases that might come before this Court.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="432.513" stopTime="437.057">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="432.513" offset="1856809">But the Court has never said that it's a constitutional right to a direct appeal.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ronald_d_maines" startTime="437.057" stopTime="441.021">
            <label>Mr. Ronald D. Maines</label>
            <text syncTime="437.057" offset="1874990">That's correct, Justice Ginsburg, absolutely.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="441.021" stopTime="448.745">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="441.021" offset="1890768">So, there's quite a sharp distinction between a trial which surely is a constitutional right and an appeal which isn't.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ronald_d_maines" startTime="448.745" stopTime="492.313">
            <label>Mr. Ronald D. Maines</label>
            <text syncTime="448.745" offset="1921697">There is that distinction, but it's not a distinction that matters for our argument in this case because the right that we're talking about is... is a... a right to counsel or not to counsel or to represent oneself, which I maintain is all part and parcel of the same right.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.369" offset="2012185">And in the right to counsel context, the Court has said that the trial setting and the direct appeal setting are at least that similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.079" offset="2067042">They're... they're at least that similar that in both cases a defendant gets a lawyer if he wants one.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="492.313" stopTime="516.351">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="492.313" offset="2095986">Mr. Maines, we're now almost 10 minutes into your argument, and we've gotten to where the right... you've established the right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.961" offset="2138513">But of course, what you have to establish here is the right to represent oneself.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.115" offset="2159202">So, maybe if you could shift over to why the right to counsel should be followed by a right to represent oneself on appeal.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ronald_d_maines" startTime="516.351" stopTime="601.648">
            <label>Mr. Ronald D. Maines</label>
            <text syncTime="516.351" offset="2192116">That's exactly right.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.172" offset="2199431">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.664" offset="2209357">The next step in the argument, therefore, is that if we accept that there is a constitutional right to counsel on direct appeal, then by implication there is the right to represent oneself on direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.728" offset="2301622">Now, some of you may be wondering about that implication, and so let me try to flesh it out a little bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.355" offset="2348120">First of all, there is precedent in this Court, of course, for the notion that the right to counsel entails or comprehends the right to represent oneself.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.729" offset="2425651">In fact, that's one of the oft-quoted passages in Faretta v. California, and I'll read the pertinent couple of sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.750" offset="2481762">The right to assistance of counsel and the correlative right to dispense with a lawyer's help are not legal formalisms.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.116" offset="2511228">They rest on considerations that go to the substance of an accused position before the law.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="601.648" stopTime="675.427">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="601.648" offset="2533275">Now, that... that's quite true and I don't think you will find the Court is doubtful at all of the Faretta ruling where we've said you have a right to counsel at... rather a right to represent oneself at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.819" offset="2593984">But it seems to me you've got several distinctions that... that you've got to tackle.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.352" offset="2612165">At trial, you've got the government, in effect, coming after the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.305" offset="2635989">The government has to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, and all the defendant has to do is just sit there and make the government prove its case, which, you know, it may have some tactical decisions to it, but it certainly does not necessarily require the skill of a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.867" offset="2710177">On appeal, a judgment of conviction, the scales are reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.251" offset="2735672">The... the appellant carries the burden on appeal, and he's got to make, presumably, legal points to... to a court, to an appellate court that hears an argument for maybe 15 or 20 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.803" offset="2789902">And to... I think you should tell us why those facts don't make any difference from Faretta in your argument.</text>

          <turn speaker="ronald_d_maines" startTime="675.427" stopTime="716.696">
            <label>Mr. Ronald D. Maines</label>
            <text syncTime="675.427" offset="2828459">They don't make a difference, Mr. Chief Justice, because they're the wrong facts to be looking at.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.531" offset="2852805">If you think about the nature of a trial, a trial is... a criminal trial is a very complex proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.596" offset="2885093">In a sense it's much more complex than the standard appeal from a conviction in a criminal trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.272" offset="2915813">There's rules of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.433" offset="2924485">There's... there's cross-examining witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.176" offset="2939427">There are rules of procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.538" offset="2944861">I... I should think that many lawyers would much rather litigate an appeal than they would a trial.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <text syncTime="1644.112" offset="6703150">Because one of the topics that can always be entertained is ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, either directly or indirectly, all the California appellate courts will hear from the pro se... or the... the individual who wants to be pro se but is not being allowed to be pro se.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.464" offset="6776606">California's system is very straightforward.</text>

            <text syncTime="2232.882" offset="9058245">Well, I think there are a number of answers, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.825" offset="9065978">First, if he doesn't trust the system, he's not going to trust the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.050" offset="9086875">So, it seems to me that it's a distrust of the whole process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.033" offset="9098892">And allowing personal access or not allowing it doesn't improve on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.354" offset="9116133">Secondly, it seems to me it's still not constitutionally required because we're giving him access.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.851" offset="9146121">In the prison law library cases, you talked that the point was access to the court system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.681" offset="9165452">And we're giving him that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.512" offset="9168795">We're giving an attorney to act as a... a sword not a shield.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.427" offset="9188440">The other point is, to be addressed, that no one is having an attorney forced upon them because the only way this happens is if the defendant initiates the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.052" offset="9226892">The defendant doesn't want anything else to do with legal system, doesn't file the notice of appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2365.794" offset="9589889">And additionally, we're saying to the defendant, if you... if you want an appeal in California, you have to abide by the rules that California has set down, so long as those rules meet due process/equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.563" offset="9637014">Some of those rules have to do with standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.584" offset="9649031">Some of those have to do with mootness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.016" offset="9654778">Some of those have to do with length of argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.908" offset="9666376">And in California, one of those is you have an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.669" offset="9677347">And I think the whole point of the Due Process Clause was to emphasize fairness between the State and individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.525" offset="9704828">And in all of the cases up until now, it has been the individual saying, I want a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.508" offset="9724786">I need a lawyer to be able to fight the State given its might, given its wealth of resources.</text>

            <text syncTime="2436.195" offset="9871489">That court has gone to a system of tentative appellate opinions which are sent out a week in advance of oral argument, as a result of which, the number of cases seeking oral argument has dropped dramatically.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.262" offset="9915793">Other courts dislike that approach and do a traditional situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2483.659" offset="10061347">I know of no State that requires it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.441" offset="10072528">Of course, in some of your opinions, you've made it clear that the courts have discretion whether or not to do it or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.135" offset="10103248">I think it's important too to remember if we're... we need to look at the State cases because in the Federal cases that we've seen so far are all governed by 28 U.S.C. 1654... that's quoted in... in the beginning of our brief... which came out of the Judiciary Act of 1789 basically saying you have a right to proceed in pro se within the regulations and... and rules of a particular court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.452" offset="10196557">So that when we look to some of these Federal cases that have talked about a right to... to be in pro se, it has to be put against the backdrop of that code section which... which dates from the earliest days of... of our... of our country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.922" offset="10254444">One of concerns, which we raised in the brief, is the implications of what happens if you accept petitioner's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.487" offset="10288717">And there are a number of them that we are particularly concerned with, one of which is how... assuming there's a constitutional right to go pro se on appeal, how would you obtain a valid waiver from a prison inmate of that right?</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.676" offset="10353396">Because in Faretta you talked about the fact that the judge can look at that individual, can gauge facial expressions, tone, inflection, to make sure that that individual can make a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.198" offset="10423509">How do you do that with an individual who is incarcerated perhaps 700 or 800 miles away from the prison?</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.153" offset="10451303">We're dealing with a constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.055" offset="10462902">I think that is a major hurdle that... that would immediately face the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.548" offset="10484949">The other problem that I think you would immediately come to is you're going to have to revisit all of your cases dealing with rights to legal materials in prisons because in those cases, you were talking about that the access to the library needed to be primarily for habeas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.299" offset="10547956">And you specifically note that the individual will have the briefs from the earlier State appeal so, in large manner, filing the Federal habeas will not be difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.186" offset="10591424">But if that individual, who's in the prison, has a constitutional right to conduct his or her direct appeal, aren't you going to have then provide them with far wider and more expensive materials than we do now?</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.896" offset="10658298">Could you handle an appeal without LEXIS or NEXIS or Westlaw?</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.030" offset="10682853">I think that the idea... what you will have to revisit is staggering.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.813" offset="10705945">We also are very concerned with... in California in order to comply with the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, which you've had on... on calendar this term, California, of course, is trying to qualify, as most of the States are, for the fast track proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.635" offset="10769266">And one of the requirements in California is that the counsel who files the brief in a death penalty case has to file the companion habeas within 90 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.341" offset="10812107">Well, first off, imagine... we're all concerned with the delay in death penalty cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.386" offset="10832273">What happens to the delay with a pro se death penalty appellant?</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.959" offset="10854529">Number two, what do we do for the habeas?</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.222" offset="10867591">Because most of that habeas material is based on matters outside the record involving investigation by counsel, involving runners, involving private investigators.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.970" offset="10910640">We are deeply concerned about the consequences of the potential that petitioner argues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.634" offset="10949302">One of his underlying premises is that the right of... the right to assistance of counsel carries with it the right to the opposite, that is, the right togo in pro se.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.595" offset="11009070">And I think in Singer you said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.137" offset="11023280">And you looked at components of the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.929" offset="11034461">You looked at public trial, and you said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.601" offset="11045119">You have a right to a public trial, but you can't waive that and force a closed trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.536" offset="11064867">You looked venue and vicinage, and you said, yes, you have that right, but you can't waive that and force the trial to be moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.421" offset="11100394">And you looked at confrontation, and you said, yes, you have a right to confrontation, but you don't have the opposite of that and to force the government to try and prosecute you with affidavits only.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.718" offset="11145638">I think the point of all of this is, is that there are significant differences between trial and appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.732" offset="11169671">This court has repeatedly recognized them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.535" offset="11184822">Those differences fully justify the system that California has instituted, which is counsel on both sides of the appeal to vigorously argue it, to make sure that appeal is not a hollow, meaningless ritual but is something important within our system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.495" offset="11248665">Unless the Court has any other questions, I would submit.</text>

            <label>Mr. Ronald D. Maines</label>
            <text syncTime="2787.490" offset="11276668">Almost any two categories can be distinguished if we... if we look at them in the right way, can be differentiated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.256" offset="11371754">And I don't dispute that there are ways to differentiate the appeal stage from the trial stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.272" offset="11407803">Indeed, they are different by definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.945" offset="11418461">I maintain, notwithstanding Mr.... Mr. Foster's arguments, that the differences which he has pointed out are not the significant ones for us to be focusing on in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.077" offset="11495052">And, therefore, that the thrust of his argument, which is that there is decisional difference between trial and appeal is not the key issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.077" offset="11546983">Also, I think it is important to rebut his claim that our approach here is that the... the right to something, a constitutional right, if waived implies the opposite of that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.418" offset="11632351">I'm... I'm... I am not make that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.631" offset="11645204">The right to counsel is not the opposite of the right to represent oneself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.737" offset="11681671">They are two sides of the same coin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.719" offset="11689612">They're not opposite rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.410" offset="11696404">It's... it's completely different from the situations that he was positing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.974" offset="11714585">So, I think that's a false... a false argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.458" offset="11736528">I don't think that holds up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.020" offset="11742797">I believe that if the Court takes a look at the pattern of its precedents, if at... if it considers the stages at which it has determined that the right to counsel occurs at a critical stage, and if the Court embraces the notion squarely set forth in Faretta v. California, that the right to counsel encompasses a correlative right to self-representation, that the result that we seek here follows straightforwardedly if the Court has determined to make sure that there's coherence in its precedents.</text>
