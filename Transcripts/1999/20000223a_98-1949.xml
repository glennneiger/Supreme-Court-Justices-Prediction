            <text syncTime="10.482" offset="189205">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.328" offset="200595">I think it is no exaggeration to suggest that the future of medical care, both in its delivery and in its regulation, are in some way implicated by the Court's decision today.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.505" offset="241241">The health care plan involved here is a standard health care plan within the employee benefits plan under ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.180" offset="275932">Carle offers vanilla, plain vanilla managed care operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.881" offset="294740">As Judge Easterbrook said in his denial of rehearing, that if Carle's set-up violates ERISA, then all managed care does so as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.675" offset="329953">Accordingly, the question is whether or not the court needs to have that kind of a dramatic effect on the managed care industry in this particular context, and I suggest to you that the answer to that is no, because there is a perfectly available and valid remedy for the people in Ms. Herdrich's position, and that is medical malpractice law.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.718" offset="406126">She had--</text>

            <text syncTime="65.388" offset="408843">Well now, I gather that the Ms. Herdrich did recover in a malpractice action in this very case.</text>

            <text syncTime="73.973" offset="443116">--In this very case, Justice O'Connor, she... the defendants were found liable, and she received 35,000 as full compensation for her... for the injuries that she suffered.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.552" offset="485434">There's no question, based on that determination, that there's been an error in judgment and that it fell below the standards of care for medical malpractice purposes, and that there are available perfectly valid remedies under State law to her.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.439" offset="548964">The question then is, is there some reason to add over those perfectly complete remedies under State law an ERISA remedy as well, and while I think that question can be posed out of narrowly--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="111.871" offset="594730">The question isn't whether there's some reason.</text>

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="115.367" offset="608732">--That's absolutely true, Justice Scalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.348" offset="612598">The question... does Congress intend for--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="116.706" stopTime="120.050">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="116.706" offset="614061">I mean, it's really not a policy question that's up to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.417" offset="620957">It's either there or it's not there.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="120.050" offset="627436">--That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.831" offset="630570">The question is whether Congress intended to add ERISA over and above the malpractice law, and I think it's important in making that determination to realize that this is essentially a zero-sum situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.487" offset="669232">That is, to the extent you expand Federal law under ERISA, the more you have to narrow State law because of the ERISA preemption provision under section 514(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="140.593" offset="709669">That says that every matter that is within plan administration, everything that relates to an ERISA plan, right, and therefore is protected under Federal law, preempts all State law that's related to it, and it seems to me quite clear under those circumstances that the court should be quite loath to expansively interpret ERISA, and certainly there's very little evidence that Congress meant to do so.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="162.550" offset="797441">Mr. Phillips, would you clarify one thing?</text>
            <text syncTime="167.084" offset="815622">You said all HMO's would fall because this is a plain vanilla scheme, and yet your opponents say that it's only a particular kind of HMO, one where the physicians have this incentive because of their bonuses, and that not all HMO's work that way.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="191.109" stopTime="228.293">
            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="191.109" offset="911648">I think actually Judge Easterbrook, in his dissenting opinion below, had the better of that argument, and he argued, and I think quite rightly, that the allegations in the respondent's complaint basically lay out the kinds of incentives that are inherent in any managed care operation in terms of questions of medical necessity, experimental treatment... all of the elements that go into trying to control what was in the 1980's an extraordinarily expensive health care system are embodied in the Carle Clinic's managed care plan, so in that sense I don't think it is significantly different from any other managed care operation, Justice Ginsburg.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="228.293" offset="1060441">Mr. Phillips, could you just clarify one simple point for me?</text>
            <text syncTime="230.726" offset="1070159">Perhaps I should ask your opponent, but given the fact that she's already recovered for the malpractice, what do you understand the nature of her recovery would be?</text>
            <text syncTime="240.155" offset="1107880">Assume she's right and you're wrong.</text>

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="241.634" offset="1113836">I think it's very difficult to know.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.274" offset="1124389">Maybe you should ask him that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.666" offset="1129927">My understanding is, first she's made no claim for damages under ERISA, and for good reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.225" offset="1152183">There are none available.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.378" offset="1156781">There are no benefits that she has not been provided under any plan, however you want to define it, and so there's no basis for recovery there.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.867" offset="1186769">She seeks no injunctive relief, so I don't know that, and indeed the amended Count III focuses on some kind of a treatment with respect to a pot of money when... and with respect to a plan that simply doesn't exist, so I have no idea what it is that respondent thinks that she will gain from this, except perhaps attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.713" offset="1262107">Obviously there is a provision for attorney's fees under ERISA, but in terms of her own stake in this, it seems to me it is quite ephemeral, and... I'm sorry, go ahead.</text>

            <text syncTime="319.170" offset="1423961">I don't think there's any basis for that logically in terms of how this scheme works out, but that's not a basis to claim there's no jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.137" offset="1447785">That's simply a basis to answer Justice Stevens' question which is, at the end of the day, when it's all said and done, if she got everything she wanted out of this, what's likely to come out of it?</text>

            <text syncTime="524.908" offset="2246923">Well, I think you have to read that in context, Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.449" offset="2257058">I mean, we certainly conceded it for purposes of the disclosure issues and the bad faith claims that were the basis for the remand order, or the remand issue in that context.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.494" offset="2297183">We have never conceded that we were a fiduciary for purposes of the amended Count III complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.302" offset="2320484">We have consistently argued that we have no fiduciary responsibilities with respect to claims in Count III, and in any event, even if the respondent's memory lasted long enough to sort of have that uppermost in her mind at the time she filed her brief in this Court, we had clearly laid out our theory of this case, which is that we are not a fiduciary for these purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.756" offset="2410241">Her defense of the judgment below is very focused, and I think it spares the Court a significant amount of time and energy having to sort out a variety of the issues that have frankly divided the Solicitor General and the petitioners in this case, questions of what goes into plan design as opposed to fiduciary responsibilities, questions of how broadly do you define the plan and its benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.611" offset="2493728">None of those issues are any longer on the table.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.644" offset="2505849">What is on the table is whether the provision of medical care and the methods of compensation for medical care, right, are part of, quote, plan administration within the meaning of section 1002(21)(A), which is the definition provision in ERISA for a fiduciary, and it is completely counterintuitive to suggest that plan administration extends to the provision of medical care, just as a matter of simple language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.112" offset="2623713">And then second, and what I think is really the most driving force in all of this, is the relationship between Federal and State law, because it seems to me absolutely inconceivable that if the Court were to decide that these kinds of medical treatment judgments and the compensation schemes that go into them are, in fact, administration of an ERISA plan, that that then doesn't preempt all State law that relates to those issues, which means--</text>

            <text syncTime="1244.091" offset="5123632">It's our position that the treatment allegations of the complaint, which regard the incentive to the physicians, to the treating physicians concerning their treatment of their patients, are governed... essentially State claims that are governed by State law but are not governed by ERISA because they don't have to do with fiduciary duty under ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.901" offset="5198864">On the other hand, the administration allegations of the complaint, if there are any there, and it's unclear to me whether there are or not, but insofar as the complaint is alleging that there was deficiencies that have to do with the claims processing function of the HMO, that is an activity that is governed by ERISA and not State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.877" offset="5278799">However, it's our position that they did not... that the complaint does not allege a violation of ERISA's fiduciary duties with respect to those issues.</text>

            <text syncTime="1311.688" offset="5394051">That's true, but insofar as the fiduciary is someone... it's an error that had to do with the exercise of discretion under the plan in deciding what... whether a certain kind of procedure is covered, then it would be a breach of fiduciary duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.309" offset="5448490">I'm not sure it makes that much difference, because if it's just an error in construing the plan, the claimant would have a claim under 502(a) for the benefit that was due in any event.</text>

            <text syncTime="1351.348" offset="5552667">It seems to me strange to talk about discretion in determining plan coverage.</text>

            <label>Mr. James A. Feldman</label>
            <text syncTime="1360.099" offset="5587671">I think discretion in this sense is used in the terms of applying the plan terms to a wide variety, sometimes fairly vague plan terms to a wide variety of different cases, and that does have something in common with what judges do, and judges do exercise discretion sometimes, but in the Varity Corporation v. Howe, the Court said... I'm reading from page 511, 516 U.S. on 511... a plan administrator engages in a fiduciary act when making discretionary determination about whether a claimant is entitled to benefits under the terms of the plan documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.160" offset="5715880">So at some point there is a fiduciary, and... who... where that person has some discretion, is making a judgment about applying some broad terms to maybe a particular set of facts, or construing what the terms mean, that person does become a fiduciary under ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.641" offset="5781813">Now, it's our position that a doctor doesn't merely by accepting a patient and forming a doctor-patient relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.268" offset="5808353">Within a doctor-patient relationship, as it has long been understood, the doctor's duties are governed by principles of medical ethics and by State law, and ERISA basically has nothing to do with that, whether it's provided by an HMO or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.451" offset="5857045">But where... and if... and in this case that's all that apparently happened, in fact, to the plaintiff, but where there is a claim made, not... which is generally not... may or may not be made to a doctor, it may be some other functionary, but somebody who's not... doesn't have a doctor-patient relationship with the plaintiff, if a claim is made that somebody wants something covered, that triggers the claims processing function of the plan and can trigger ERISA's fiduciary duties.</text>

            <text syncTime="1858.448" offset="7581023">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.816" offset="7602547">Mr. Phillips indicated that it's no exaggeration to indicate that this particular lawsuit is an attack on managed care as a whole, that what we have is a standard plain vanilla HMO.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.483" offset="7677153">I beg to differ with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.862" offset="7682691">We don't have, in this case, a standard, plain vanilla HMO, and maybe drawing a comparison to another type of HMO is the best example of what I'm trying to describe here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.725" offset="7726159">Take an HMO like Humana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.580" offset="7741623">Humana is a publicly traded corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.959" offset="7755103">There are over 167 million outstanding shares of Humana stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.053" offset="7775478">The owners of the Humana stock, as owners, are a group of people that are separate and distinct from Humana, the company that employs the claims reviewers and the medical directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.899" offset="7842874">Separate and apart from that group is then the contracted physicians that provide the services, so in many, if not most HMO's, you've got three distinct groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.402" offset="7888849">You've got the owners, separate and apart from the employees of the company making the claims decisions, separate and apart from the doctors who are providing the primary care.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.811" offset="7934512">Here, all three groups are one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.021" offset="7943289">They're all one entity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1951.511" offset="7953320">But what has that to do with it, because if they had it separate, then your clients or some future clients would simply sue the right group.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.347" offset="7976621">I mean, I take it the underlying substantive question is, whoever is making this decision, you're saying it's a breach of a fiduciary relationship to have a set of economic incentives that makes them look at costs as well as health.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.616" offset="8025731">Now, the separation issue is one, that even assuming you're right on that, it's very hard for me to believe in respect to cost incentives that the same Congress that in 1973 wrote an HMO act, and the same Congress that has provided for incentives that encourage HMO's throughout, in ERISA, without saying anything, wanted to gut its own HMO legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.352" offset="8116637">Now, that's where I start on this, and I put that up front, because I want to know how your theory doesn't achieve a result that I just find it very hard to believe Congress wanted.</text>

            <text syncTime="2021.658" offset="8233875">It does not specify anywhere in that act what cost containment mechanism should or should not be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.473" offset="8261147">That is not specified, and it to my knowledge is not specified by any... in any regulation by the Department of Labor or any other bureaucracy of the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.043" offset="8295419">The phenomenon that we have with respect to these physician bonuses, the physician incentives, is a relatively recent phenomenon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.656" offset="8333872">It first came to the Government's attention in the 1986 report by the GAO, where they concluded that incentives seem to have a deleterious effect on the health of the patients being treated by the doctors who are incentivized.</text>

            <text syncTime="2073.092" offset="8439615">Now, to do that, you have to have doctors who pay attention to patients all across the board, and you also have to tell those doctors, don't use the most expensive treatment before you look at what will actually benefit the patient throughout the cost of his life.</text>

            <text syncTime="2127.233" offset="8656223">You don't have an independent third party administrator making those claims decisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2136.409" offset="8692898">It also explains some of the Solicitor General's, I think misconceptions with respect to various relationships of the parties, because the doctors that are the owners, the sole owners of the HMO, and employ themselves as the primary care physicians, aren't dealing at arm's length.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.806" offset="8786521">One of the positions of the Solicitor General is that you can't have any limitations, as we suggest in this particular case, upon an HMO's right to contract with doctors.</text>
