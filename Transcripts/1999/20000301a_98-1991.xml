            <text syncTime="1765.530" offset="7206134">Those new 50 acres have to be apportioned in precisely the same proportion, and if a third or fourth rancher comes in, he must get zero, must in all circumstances, and if one of those existing ranchers tries to take 1 acre more than his proportionate share, he cannot get it, in no circumstance.</text>

            <text syncTime="3010.470" offset="12185909">As we... the land use plan requirement came into effect in 1978, and as we point out in our brief, all grazing covered by the Taylor Grazing Act is now covered by land use plans, either prior, what were called framework plans, or the new resource management plans, and petitioners have still not shown anything to this Court that suggests that that land use management process, which was designed to instill stability in the areas covered by those plans, has failed to take into account existing grazing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.390" offset="12309625">And as we also point out in our brief, the Taylor Grazing Act... excuse me, FLPMA and implementing regulations refer to existing uses of the range, the dependence of local properties and private property and local communities on the range, so the land use planning process, which also has broad public participation and allows for grazing permittees to participate in the planning process and to appeal, affords ranchers, as others who have a stake in the use of the public domain, it assures them protection for their interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.320" offset="12445357">If I could also point out that in the rule-making, in response to your question, Justice Breyer, I realize it hasn't been challenge on a failure to articulate, but pages 9921 to 9923 of 60 Federal Register and the proposed notice at 59 Federal Register at 9928 explain the Secretary's reasons for what he explained was essentially a change in terminology between the permitted... the new definition of permitted use, which corresponds to sentence 4 of the Taylor Grazing Act dealing with the numbers of livestock from time to time, separating that from preference, which is governed by sentence 3 of section 3 of the Taylor Grazing Act, which talks about who among potential grazers would have a priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.295" offset="12617243">That doesn't give grazers, either individually or as a class, a preference over nongrazing use of the forage and, as I say, increases and decreases in new forage that becomes available for grazing are handled in essentially the same way.</text>

            <text syncTime="3135.013" offset="12684116">Is there anything in the new regulations, though, that links permitted use by grazers to either the grazing preference or any other measure of numbers needed by the permit-holders to support an economically viable grazing unit in combination with their own base properties and water, which is what the Taylor Grazing Act contemplated?</text>

            <text syncTime="3172.248" offset="12833014">The permitted use, the regulations provide that permitted use must be stated and the number of AUM's must be stated in the permit, and it's attached to the base property, just as in the prior situation preference and the AUM's as they were stated under preference were attached to the base property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.453" offset="12905844">The... your reference to sentence 3 of the Taylor Grazing Act, as may be necessary, again was a way of apportioning up the land at the time the act went into effect, but it's important to notice that the renewal permit provision of FLPMA makes it clear that there is not an ongoing entitlement to a certain amount of public rangeland in order to satisfy whatever the base properties ranching requirements are, because all there is is a preference to renewal of the permit for a particular allotment, but the land use planning process or other ecological determinations may conclude that that particular allotment can only sustain 50 percent of the grazing that it previously allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.778" offset="13087134">That may be less public land than would be necessary to sustain the full ranch on the base property, but nothing in the Taylor Grazing Act, and certainly nothing after FLPMA, would allow a rancher to say, I have a right to oust other uses of the land, or a right to allow grazing in a way that might damage the land in order to be able to support my base property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.986" offset="13175950">Again, this is just an apportionment among ranchers to the extent the Secretary allows grazing to occur on the public domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.249" offset="13204998">With respect to the adequately safeguarded, I wanted to make two other points about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.882" offset="13219522">It says to the extent consistent with the purposes of the act, which as I mentioned elsewhere talk about orderly use and prevent destruction of range resources, so that is an important limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.339" offset="13273439">It also says, grazing privileges recognized and acknowledged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.137" offset="13288590">Whatever grazing privileges a rancher gets under a permit are automatically conditioned by the provisions of the Taylor Grazing Act itself and regulations that allow the Secretary to reduce grazing to modify the use of the land and to protect the environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.512" offset="13342089">There have not been any questions about the other two regulations that are at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.813" offset="13363300">On the range improvements, we think that there the Secretary is just exercising the authority that any landlord or any landowner would have to work out by agreement in advance what would be the disposition of improvements that are added to the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.856" offset="13427457">That simplifies it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.546" offset="13434249">There is no reason to refer to arcane rules of fixtures under property law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.716" offset="13450863">The Secretary has simply specified in advance what the ownership of improvements will be, which greatly simplifies the administration of what are after all public lands, so that there will not be private stakeholdings, private fixtures on public lands, and after all, if they were fixtures, the only right would be to remove them and you certainly couldn't remove a well, probably, that had been constructed by a prior owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.722" offset="13554934">It wouldn't make sense to renew fences.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.663" offset="13562667">So what has happened is, there's provisions for compensation rather than the removal of the fixtures.</text>

            <text syncTime="3371.548" offset="13630271">Preference was adjudicated according to what was necessary for the proper use of the base property and the statute says that the privileges, including that adjudicated amount of forage, have to be adequately safeguarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.159" offset="13688681">The reason that this is a facial challenge is that the 1995 regulations define permitted use by reference to a land use plan, and without any reference whatsoever to the preference amount adjudicated as necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.416" offset="13757749">The needs of the base property have entirely disappeared.</text>

            <text syncTime="3609.161" offset="14580711">All of our protections, all of our safeguards reflected in the regulations prior to 1995 have now completely disappeared, and it's not the land use plan that's responsible for that.</text>
