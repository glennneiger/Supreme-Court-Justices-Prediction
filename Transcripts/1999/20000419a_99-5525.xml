            <text syncTime="14.027" offset="199533">Thirty-four years ago, in Miranda v.

            <text syncTime="34.018" offset="279572">The question before the Court today asks whether Congress has the authority to legislatively overrule and reverse this Court's decision in Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.451" offset="321263">The key to this question turns on whether the requirements of Miranda are constitutionally based and therefore immune from legislative modification, or are something else: as the Foruth Circuit ruled, a mere exercise of the Court's power to prescribe rules and procedures for courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="225.476" offset="1045377">The constitutional requirement of Miranda is that there be protective procedures in place to fully inform a suspect of his rights, so that he knows his rights, so that he knows he can exercise those rights, he knows that his interrogators will honor those rights, and so that the court will know that any waiver of those rights was made knowingly and intentionally, not just voluntarily.</text>

            <text syncTime="1216.660" offset="5010138">The second one, which really does precede the third one, is that section 3501 in our view cannot be reconciled with Miranda and therefore could be upheld by this Court only if the Court were to be prepared to overrule Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.544" offset="5081609">Now, why do I say that in our view, because it is certainly... it may be very unusual, but it would not be improper for the Solicitor General of the United States to ask this Court to reconsider and overrule one of its precedents, although in this case we're talking about 34 years and, as the Chief Justice has mentioned, 50 precedents, but let me just list the four reasons why, in our view, the Court... the case has not been made to overrule Miranda v. Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.828" offset="5206788">First, we think that stability in the law is important, and it is nowhere more important than in this case, given the Court's extremely unhappy experience with the law of confessions under the totality-of-the-circumstances, and the certainty that this Court has repeatedly recognized that Miranda provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.428" offset="5297172">Second, in our view, Miranda, as it has been developed and tailored and refined by this Court, has proven workable, and its benefits to the administration of justice have been repeatedly emphasized by this Court and documented by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.812" offset="5374703">Third, in its... all of its post-Miranda cases, this Court has reaffirmed Miranda's underlying premise, that is that custodial interrogation creates inherently compelling pressures that require some safeguards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.179" offset="5452235">And finally, any reevaluation of Miranda must take account of the profoundly unhappy experience of this Court that impelled its adoption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.534" offset="5501658">Applying the totality-of-the-circumstances test in 36 cases over 30 years before 1966, the Court was simply unable to articulate manageable rules for the lower courts to apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="1378.975" offset="5659333">The difficulty that this Court found was its inability to expound the law, that is, to give to the lower Federal courts a set of articulable, manageable rules that would predictably govern the introduction of confessions in the case in chief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.576" offset="5729759">Let me just say this in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.825" offset="5738746">The constitutional test, I think under either the Fifth Amendment or the Fourteenth Amendment, is voluntariness.</text>

            <text syncTime="1462.722" offset="5994328">And my only point is that the Court's experience under the totality test was that seemingly the more cases it decided, the less actual guidance was provided to lower courts, and thereby to prosecutors and police, for what the rules were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.842" offset="6062873">What is the bright-line legal standard that will allow us to determine something, something is admissible or not admissible, given the inherent difficulty of determining what actually occurred and what actually happened in the mind of a suspect in this very distinctive context?</text>

            <text syncTime="1562.526" offset="6393583">The Court in Miranda relied on Bram for the same proposition that the United States relied on it in Miranda itself, which is that the Fifth Amendment applies in the context of custodial interrogation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1612.959" offset="6595353">And the problem with the standard was that, under the totality-of-the-circumstances, everything is relevant and nothing is determinative.</text>

            <text syncTime="1685.633" offset="6886044">You have asked both of our colleagues on the other side of the room whether the Miranda rights or the Miranda procedures are constitutional requirements, and I think the answer they gave was yes, which is what they have to say to win this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.471" offset="6933377">The difficulty with that answer is, it would require this Court to overrule more than a quarter of a century of jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.329" offset="6960754">To turn, for example, to this Court's holding in Oregon v. Elstad, this Court refused to apply the fruit-of-the-poisonous-tree doctrine, and the reason it gave was that a simple failure to administer Miranda warnings is not, in itself, a violation of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.884" offset="7027000">Justice O'Connor's opinion for the Court went on to say that the Miranda rule may be triggered even in the absence of a Fifth Amendment violation, and it's important to understand what the holding in that case was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.583" offset="7077782">The holding there was that there was no reason to suppress the fruit of a non-Mirandized statement that is derivative evidence, and the reason this Court gave was, and again I am quoting, there was no actual infringement of the suspect's constitutional rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="2166.535" offset="8809596">The justification for going to that system is that we understand that the Fifth Amendment has an application in the station house as well as in the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.079" offset="8847839">Because it does, we are going to go from a system that inquires solely into voluntariness as a matter of fact, but to a system which inquires in the first instance about knowing waiver of Fifth Amendment rights and we accept, the Court said, the proposition that there may be other ways to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.413" offset="8937178">We would accept the possibility of equivalents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.880" offset="8947000">But I think... and this is where I go back to Justice Ginsburg's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.300" offset="8968630">I understood, when the Court talked about equivalents, that it was talking about equivalents to this knowing waiver kind of system, and the problem that we have with the statute here is that it seems to go from the necessity of a knowing waiver system, when the statement is to be used in a case in chief, back to a voluntariness system, and that does not seem to be an equivalent, either in fact or in law, as Miranda was using it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3475.625" offset="14045998">Let me, just in response to Mr. Cassell's argument that this was a mere technical violaton by the police officers conducting this investigation, respond that we firmly believe the district court was correct in its factual finding that the police failed to appropriately apprise Mr. Dickerson of his rights that it wasn't simply a mistake by the prosecutor to introduce evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.882" offset="14131053">There was no evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.912" offset="14135128">I'd also like to point out that it is this Court that sets the limits of the Bill of Rights including the Fifth Amendment, not Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.425" offset="14169191">In Miranda, this Court set a constitutional minimum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.564" offset="14181730">Congress didn't attempt to meet that minimum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.798" offset="14194687">Rather, they attempted to roll the clock back and reverse it, and reimpose totality-of-the-circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.512" offset="14221541">This is the reason section 3501 fails.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.371" offset="14237005">I would agree with Justice O'Connor's question that this case boils down to the sufficiency of 3501... Does it meet the standards set forth in Miranda +/?</text>
