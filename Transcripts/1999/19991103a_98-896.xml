            <text syncTime="72.196" offset="431594">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="75.231" offset="443715">The parties in this case advocate different accrual rules for civil RICO, and that difference is starkly illustrated by the way that the parties view two important dates in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.437" offset="484571">The first date is 1986, when the plaintiff was released from a mental institution after 479 days of confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.943" offset="514559">The second date is 1994, when the plaintiff learned that the company that was operating that institution had pled guilty to Federal fraud and conspiracy charges for a scheme that included paying kick-backs to doctors for keeping the patient census high.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.387" offset="580388">The Defendants contend that the civil RICO claim in this case had accrued for the statute of limitations purposes and that the statute had begun to run in 1986, when the plaintiff was released from the hospital, and that therefore the statute of limitations had expired by 1990, 4 years before the Federal Government had even announced the guilty pleas.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.401" offset="668473">The plaintiff, on the other hand, argues that the RICO claim did not accrue until 1994, when he first learned that the hospitalization was related to a pattern of racketeering activity, and the question then presented for the Court is which accrual rule is proper for civil RICO.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard P. Hogan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="162.254" offset="791875">--The template that the Court would take from the Clayton Act, Your Honor, would not fit for civil RICO and, as this Court recognized in Klehr, the pure injury accrual rule, it suggested, might not work without some modification in the situation of civil RICO, unlike the antitrust laws, because the antitrust laws require only separate and discrete single acts and not a pattern of racketeering activity, and so it's okay for the antitrust laws to use an injury accrual rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.689" offset="905560">We simply suggest to the Court that it does not reach this question, because the pattern of racketeering activity is absent in the antitrust laws when it is present in civil RICO.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="201.064" offset="947042">Well, perhaps the rule could be the injury plus the existence of a cause of action, which means there has to have been a pattern, and I suppose that principles of equitable estoppel might be available in circumstances where the pattern was undiscoverable due to conduct of the defendants.</text>

            <text syncTime="226.446" offset="1048607">But equitable estoppel principles, Your Honor, also will not work, we suggest, for civil RICO.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.266" offset="1067937">Obviously, the suggestion that we might need some sort of equitable estoppel principles or other equitable tolling principles suggests that there are harsh facts which might require those types of remedies, but we think that the rule ought to address those things up front, as this Court suggested in the Beggerly decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="249.061" offset="1139095">Well, but in some cases you're going to have affirmative concealment, and the equitable tolling would address that and let the other things be governed by the normal rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="261.201" offset="1187682">--the equitable tolling principles that would involve fraudulent concealment require affirmative acts or affirmative conduct on the part of the defendant to conceal the cause of action, so that if the defendant does nothing, as in this case, simply does not speak and remains mute, the plaintiff would be unable to take advantage of any equitable tolling.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="295.255" offset="1323833">I thought Posner has a long decision in which he explains all this, and he goes into it, and I thought, well, if your complaint is fraudulent concealment versus equitable tolling, we could work that out in some other case.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.830" offset="1374197">The basic principle is, the statute of limitation starts to run, and an unfair result is stopped by principles of fraudulent concealment like the antitrust law, or equitable tolling, as in fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.573" offset="1429158">It isn't a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.274" offset="1435950">So you tell me it is a problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="334.796" offset="1482030">The reason it's an advantage is because, if a person discovers the thing after only a year, he gets an extra year.</text>

            <text syncTime="2858.603" offset="11577207">--Well, I don't think the confusion would help all the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.424" offset="11596538">Because of the variety of opinions, as this Court is well aware, below, that there is such a diverse... the split is 7-5, 6-6, depends on how you look at it, and it needs to be resolved, because these RICO cases, of course, are still coming into the courthouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.700" offset="11657665">They're still coming in, and we just believe that the injury discovery rule, which has been applied for such a long period of time, deals with that more effectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.372" offset="11692355">Let me address briefly the tolling issue, that... particularly in the reply brief, the petitioner mentions that in U.S. v. Beggerly that somehow this Court held that if a discovery rule is built into the accrual rule, that equitable tolling does not apply, and that is simply overstating the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.001" offset="11762886">It is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.901" offset="11766438">Equitable tolling applies in all accrual rules, as this Court stated in Holmberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.005" offset="11794860">If the plaintiff... to take care of the concern of the petitioner, if the plaintiff simply cannot discover the essential information with diligence, and that's the key, with diligence, then the courts have applied and can apply equitable tolling to allow that person to bring suit within a reasonable time after he discovers that essential information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.139" offset="11891408">That is available in this rule, and so the fear of not knowing the pattern, and with the definition of pattern, as this Court recognized in a Sedima footnote and of course in H.J., being as nebulous and nefarious as it is as to what that means, delaying accrual until a plaintiff discovers the related acts and that it poses a threat of continuous activity would just delay it way too long.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.472" offset="12000705">And we need a firmly defined, easily applied rule of accrual, as the Court in the Garcia case mentioned, and the injury discovery rule is... runs from a more ascertainable, definite, and certain event, rather than the nebulous pattern event, and so it's more workable, and it has the balance of the parties--</text>

            <text syncTime="3088.370" offset="12496300">The complaint, the vast majority of the allegations in the complaint, Justice Stevens, allege such an injury, but under RICO that is what he cannot recover, and the prayer is so general it just says actual damages within the court's jurisdiction, which doesn't work either, but it's very vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.332" offset="12568189">But you're correct, he can only recover the value, I would assume after, now, 15 years, the value of the property that was withheld his personal liberty deprivation, which is really the gist of the case, as we said in our brief in opposition to the petition for cert, that is really what he is claiming his injury is from the RICO conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.595" offset="12653243">They committed commercial robbery to keep patients in for their parents' insurance money, in this instance he was a minor, and that... so he was there for this long period of time, and that he wouldn't have been there but for this agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.653" offset="12709459">So that's his alleged injury as a proximate result of this alleged conspiracy, but it's not recoverable under RICO, only the injury to property, which is vaguely tied to the predicate act, but that is his injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.996" offset="12766824">So he doesn't really have, other than just small injury to his personal property, a RICO injury, and the bulk of his complaint is a personal injury complaint, which is not recoverable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.487" offset="12812799">So that Mr. Rotella waited 11 years to bring this cause of action, 11 years after his discharge, 11 years after he knew his injury, all of his injuries, demonstrates why the injury and pattern discovery rule simply is not workable in the civil RICO context.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard P. Hogan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3194.038" offset="12918961">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.008" offset="12934843">Let me at the outset put to rest any notion that we brought this claim to recover Mr. Rotella's personal effects, because this case is not about recovering his tennis shoes or his blue jeans that were taken from him when he checked into the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.082" offset="12987193">This case is about whether RICO is a supplemental remedy in addition to State tort causes of action, and it is about whether this Court will adhere to the traditional recovery rule that injury plus its cause must be known before the cause of action accrues, and it is thirdly about whether equitable tolling will apply, and that's the point at which I'd like to begin my remarks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.746" offset="13073815">Because equitable tolling is supposed to be only the exception and not the rule, if, in fact, equitable tolling becomes the doctrine on which plaintiffs rely in every RICO case, then it is no longer the exception, it is the core RICO case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.374" offset="13136300">This is a core RICO case, where the plaintiff did not know and could not have known of the existence of a RICO injury until the Federal indictments were announced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.832" offset="13182171">So if you have plaintiffs pleading in every case--</text>

            <text syncTime="3262.967" offset="13194709">But you have a... let us suppose that we think the equitable tolling doctrine requires affirmative concealment, as there was in Holmberg, which you rely on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.156" offset="13235460">That certainly is going to narrow the class of cases you just described, when you... if you require affirmative concealment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3280.762" offset="13265867">It would only narrow the plaintiff's ability to take advantage of that doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.531" offset="13280913">What we submit is that plaintiffs will be pleading this right and left to get into court, because they will not be able to discover the inherently secretive and concealed nature of the RICO enterprises that they claim have been the perpetrators of the pattern of racketeering, and if those things are secretive by nature, and plaintiffs must often plead the equitable tolling doctrine, then it makes much more sense to incorporate the knew-or-should-have-known standard of equity within the accrual rule itself, and then give everybody a predictable 4-year limitations period in which to bring suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.054" offset="13427095">The defendants have argued in this case that there is no ability, there is no problem of practicality, that plaintiffs would not have a problem simply pleading a RICO claim, going and doing discovery, and finding out the existence of the enterprise, but, of course, what would be the first response of every defendant should a plaintiff plead that sort of a claim?</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.621" offset="13529286">It would be, Your Honor, the plaintiff is engaging in a fishing expedition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.490" offset="13544750">There is no related claim to this, and there is only a fishing expedition to try and find a RICO claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.560" offset="13569096">We submit that the Court ought to decline the invitation to reconstitute the civil RICO cause of action in the guise of adopting and defining a limited accrual rule, and that this Court ought to recognize that the distinctive nature of RICO is its pattern requirement, without which there is no RICO claim, and to that extent, should the Court recognize that the pattern element is the core of RICO and that equitable doctrines must be incorporated within the rule itself, we submit that the Court therefore ought to reverse and remand this case.</text>
