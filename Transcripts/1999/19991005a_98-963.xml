            <text syncTime="20.336" offset="228167">23 years ago this Court decided in Buckley v. Valeo that a 1,000 dollar campaign contribution limit, applicable to elections for Federal office, was constitutionally valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.653" offset="269441">Legislatures and city councils across the country have adopted contribution limits relying on that holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.077" offset="299116">The holding of the Eighth Circuit is a direct challenge to the continuing validity of the Buckley ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.211" offset="323671">Respondents say that the Court's First Amendment decisions have supplemented Buckley, but this is a thinly veiled contention that the Court should overrule Buckley.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.528" offset="360974">Respondents' amici more honestly urge the Court to overrule the contribution holding in Buckley.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.333" offset="380200">Respondents have not made the convincing showing necessary to depart from settled principles of stare decisis.</text>

            <text syncTime="67.748" offset="417816">I mean, supposing we had a campaign limit of contribution enacted instead of in 1974, in the depths of the Depression, and it came up many years later, would you say that that was an attack on stare decisis to say this at this level is too low?</text>

            <text syncTime="86.210" offset="491690">There may be times, Mr. Chief Justice, where the level does get too low, but in this case they've clearly not proven that it's different in kind, nor have they proven the ultimate burden, which is that the speech of candidates in campaigns has been impaired.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.540" offset="544980">To the contrary is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.149" offset="551458">With the limits, the amount of money expended by candidates has expanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.982" offset="566714">Consequently, this situation is not the place in which inflation would drive this limit to be unuseful.</text>

            <text syncTime="116.500" offset="612794">The fact that it's expanded doesn't prove anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.323" offset="628154">I mean, it might have expanded more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.386" offset="636409">It's expanded, perhaps, because of the new electronic media that give candidates so much more opportunity to try to reach the public with their views, and it costs a lot of money, so the fact that more money is spent doesn't prove a thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.126" offset="695341">Ten times as much might have been spent.</text>

            <text syncTime="296.094" offset="1331161">I think that the... if you read all the opinions in Buckley, the Court still said the State statute would have to pass rigorous First Amendment scrutiny, and that incorporates establishing what the State purpose is of the legislation and whether it's sufficiently important to justify whatever infringement may exist, so it is important to know exactly what Missouri has put forward to justify the legislation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1080.377" offset="4468363">First, that a 1,000 dollar limit on contributions imposed only an attenuated burden on First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.172" offset="4503472">Second, that of all forms of political support, large contributions pose the greatest threat to the integrity of the system because the potential for and the appearance of corruption are what this Court deemed inherent in a regime of large financial contributions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1131.447" offset="4672641">Looking at all three of those, either separately and together, the Court in Buckley concluded that a 1,000 dollar limit imposed only an incidental burden, or an incidental restriction, or an attenuated burden on the three rights taken together, and for that reason, and this responds to Justice Ginsburg's question, the Court applied a less-than-strict standard of scrutiny that it formally announced and unanimously adopted in another election-related case shortly after, a case called Burdick v. Takushi, in which the Court said, in an election context, when First Amendment rights are subjected to severe restrictions, the regulation must be narrowly drawn to advance a governmental interest of compelling importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.482" offset="4884755">But when an election-related provision imposes only reasonable nondiscriminatory restrictions against First Amendment rights, the Government's important regulatory interests are generally sufficient to justify the restriction, and that--</text>

            <text syncTime="1484.705" offset="6085656">First of all, I think it's fair to say that contributions are conduct that has an expressive component, and the potential for corruption comes from the nonspeech element of the large contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.623" offset="6141349">Second of all, it is true that there may be other forms of activity that might beholden a candidate to act in his own self-interest, rather than in the disinterested conduct of his public functions, but Congress and legislatures are surely entitled to focus at least first on the conduct that it concludes forms the most immediate basis for corruption, or the perception of corruption, and which... and I think this goes to some of your earlier questions... poses the fewest First Amendment problems in terms of regulation, and I think that's really what the contribution limit--</text>

            <text syncTime="1601.651" offset="6553457">Now, with respect to the candidate's rights, the rights of association, which are stronger than the candidate's rights to speech, which can be extinguished if a candidate agrees to take matching funds, as the Presidential Funding Act allows, what this Court found under the level of scrutiny that was applied in Buckley was that the contribution limit, and I'm quoting here, focuses precisely and only on the narrow aspect of political association where the actuality and potentiality for corruption have been identified, while leaving persons free to engage in independent political expression, to associate actively through volunteering their services, and to assist to a limited but substantial extent in supporting candidates.</text>

          <turn speaker="d_bruce_la_pierre" startTime="1665.823" stopTime="1774.366">
            <label>Mr. D. Bruce La Pierre</label>
            <text syncTime="1665.823" offset="6810084">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.387" offset="6836415">Let me start by noting a couple of comments in response to the argument so far.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.723" offset="6857731">The argument shows the difficulty with using an appearance of corruption as a justification for imposing limits on campaign contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.927" offset="6894512">An appearance of corruption arises whenever an individual does something that pleases his or her contributors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.252" offset="6919798">And second, with respect to the difference of evidence before Congress in 1974, as opposed to the evidence before the State of Missouri in 1994, Congress, when it acted in 1994, and the Court noted this point when it referred to the court of appeals opinion, the court of appeals specifically found that the record before Congress was replete with specific examples of improper attempts to obtain governmental favor in exchange for large campaign contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.042" offset="7042992">Missouri's only evidence is the affidavit of Senator Goode.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.843" offset="7058143">With respect to the effect of the Missouri contribution limits on the amount of contributions, the record shows only... and this is with regard to two elections that the State of Missouri examined in 1992... the contribution limit in 1994 would have been 1,000 dollars under Missouri law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.506" offset="7140898">It's been raised to 1,075 dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.128" offset="7147377">With respect to the two elections, that the State of Missouri examined 1.49 and 2.38 percent of the contributions made in the 1994 elections would have been barred by the 1,000 dollar limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.228" offset="7203697">It hardly seems like contributions in excess of 1,000 dollars could be any real problem if the contributions that are barred were such a very small number.</text>

            <text syncTime="1774.366" offset="7244239">Well, if you first accept the proposition that you mentioned a moment ago that the appearance of corruption in effect is not really a serious argument here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.490" offset="7276735">If it is a serious argument here, then the elimination of corruption to the percentages that you mentioned I suppose would be a legitimate and significant justification.</text>

            <text syncTime="1798.000" offset="7338802">The appearance of corruption is amorphous.</text>

            <text syncTime="1804.425" offset="7364507">Well, I mean, is it difficult to estab... I mean, I assume a couple of things are meant by appearance of corruption, and you know, tell me if I'm wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.120" offset="7395331">One has been mentioned, and that is, I think most people assume... I do, certainly... that someone making an extraordinarily large contribution is going to get some kind of an extraordinary return for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.919" offset="7446531">I think that is a pervasive assumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.274" offset="7463876">And number 2, there is certainly an appearance of, call it an attenuated corruption, if you will, that large contributors are simply going to get better service, whatever that service may be, from a politician than the average contributor, let alone no contributor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.426" offset="7544543">Now, those are at least two perceptions, and aren't they sound ones?</text>

            <text syncTime="1887.200" offset="7695635">And political scientists may be reasonably sure... I... they're not unanimous, I understand, but some of them may be reasonably sure that the money does not buy what most people think it buys, but I don't think there has been a refutation that most people do think that it buys something that shouldn't be bought, and as long as that is the case, the argument against the appearance of corruption is in part an argument against the cynicism that that induces, and I would suppose that was still a sound argument and a sound justification.</text>

            <text syncTime="1958.557" offset="7981101">And I would agree with that approach but for this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.830" offset="7998133">What we... it seems to me that what courts need to require, certainly in First Amendment or any other areas, by way of empirical justification in support of legislation, depends on the probability or improbability of what is being asserted as the justification, and it seems to me... I will speak as one judge... highly plausible that people assume that something very, very good and extraordinary is going to be purchased by an extraordinary contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.543" offset="8137000">And therefore the justification for appearance of corruption and cynicism and so on seems inherently plausible to me, and therefore I don't know why a court should require as high degree of empirical justification as we do, for example, when effects of the Internet are suggested, and nobody knows how the Internet works.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.228" offset="8227697">So what is your answer to the question, why do we need an unusual empirical, or a heavily empirical justification for something which seems so intuitively plausible?</text>
