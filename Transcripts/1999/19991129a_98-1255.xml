          <turn speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="10.031" stopTime="112.570">
            <label>Mr. Michael R. Dreeben</label>
            <text syncTime="10.031" offset="186527">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.003" offset="198334">This case concerns a recurring problem in Federal jury selection: the erroneous refusal of a trial judge to dismiss a potential juror for cause, followed by the defendant's exercise of a peremptory challenge to remove that juror</text>
            <text syncTime="29.350" offset="263745">The Ninth Circuit held in this case that that sequence of events requires automatic reversal of a conviction whenever the defendant goes on to exhaust his peremptory challenges during jury selection.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.239" offset="311288">We disagree with that result for three alternative theories.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.606" offset="332813">First, the use of a peremptory challenge to exclude a juror who should have been excused for cause is not a denial or impairment of the peremptory challenge right, but is a proper purpose for which the challenge is used.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.634" offset="392894">Second, assuming that there is an impairment of the peremptory challenge right in a case like this one, that impairment does not warrant reversal of an otherwise fair trial where the jury that is actually empaneled and sits is impartial within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.755" offset="465410">And third, even if there is a case in which, despite the impartiality of the jury that sits, there might be an error in the peremptory challenge process that affects substantial rights, no such effect should be found in a case like this one where the defendant had concededly untrammeled use of 9 out of 10 of his peremptory challenges and never indicated on the record that he objected to any panel member that was actually empaneled and seated on the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="112.570" offset="596650">Mr. Dreeben, you...  you mentioned I think peremptory challenge right impairment.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.393" offset="619951">What is the source of those peremptory challenge rights?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="121.858" stopTime="155.666">
            <label>Mr. Michael R. Dreeben</label>
            <text syncTime="121.858" offset="633743">The source of peremptory challenge rights in the Federal system is rule 24 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure which provides a right of peremptory challenge to the defense in criminal cases that increases in number depending on the type of case that there is.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.774" offset="705423">Now, rule 24 does not, by its terms, spell out what procedures trial courts should use to administer the peremptory challenge process.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.979" offset="742308">And this Court has long made it clear that trial courts have discretion to formulate appropriate procedures.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="155.666" offset="769058">I take it then it really is impossible to justify the Ninth Circuit's reasoning if there's a constitutional question here where we're talking about Federal rules.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="163.923" stopTime="203.199">
            <label>Mr. Michael R. Dreeben</label>
            <text syncTime="163.923" offset="802076">That's right, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.409" offset="808032">The...  the only impairment that is conceivable on this record in our view would be of the rule 24 right of peremptory challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.832" offset="841678">The Ninth Circuit, in effect, converted what it thought was a violation of the rule into a due process problem by reasoning that any time a defendant is deprived of a rule-based right, the defendant is also deprived of a procedural right protected by the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.665" offset="913045">That is not a theory that this Court has ever endorsed in its analysis of a variety of rule-based and statutory rights, particularly in the context of Federal habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.439" offset="956094">And as a...</text>

          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="203.199" stopTime="233.646">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="203.199" offset="959125">But as far as rules are concerned, Mr. Dreeben, this case is...  is perhaps larger than...  on the face because the same peremptory challenge by rule, by Federal rule, exists on the civil side.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.762" offset="1013355">So, is your argument today based on the consequences of not allowing a challenge for cause improperly...  does that...  would that follow equally for civil peremptory for-cause challenges?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="233.646" stopTime="302.461">
            <label>Mr. Michael R. Dreeben</label>
            <text syncTime="233.646" offset="1080960">Certainly, Justice Ginsburg, I think that the rule that...  that we are arguing for today would apply equally, if not even more strongly, in the civil context.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.768" offset="1117427">This Court has already made clear in the McDonough v. Greenwood case that errors in the voir dire process that might impair the intelligent exercise of peremptory challenges do not rise to the level of harmful error requiring reversal of a...  of a civil judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.716" offset="1193182">And the principle that the Court applied in that case is that the cost to society, to the courts, to the litigants is too high to reverse a conviction simply because an error in the jury selection process might have infringed a party's desire to remove a particular juror on a peremptory basis rather than for cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.916" offset="1285969">Now, if the error in question in jury selection actually results in the seating of a biased juror and the defendant has adequately preserved that challenge, that is an entirely different case because that case goes to the heart of what the Sixth Amendment protects for the defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1118.311" offset="4619611">I would have that interpretation, but I don't think that it's essential that the Court agree with that in order to agree that there is no infringement of the peremptory challenge when the defendant actually does what he does in this case because assuming that he could get review if he lets the biased juror sit on the jury and he actually has a fact-finder who doesn't satisfy the Sixth Amendment and this Court determines that's an error that warrants review either under reserved...  preserved error or plain error, it doesn't mean that he should also have the opportunity of having it the other way, actually using his peremptory challenge to remove that biased juror and still getting reversal on the theory that his peremptory challenge rights have been infringed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.459" offset="4788153">And that's where we fundamentally part company with respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.553" offset="4800587">Respondent would have it that the defendant automatically gets reversal of his conviction if the judge makes even a single error in assessing a for-cause challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.091" offset="4838726">And that is not an uncommon experience in the Federal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.806" offset="4853564">One of the reasons why it doesn't result in the reversal of convictions in many circuits is they employ the rule that we're advocating here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.608" offset="4884806">If the defendant uses his peremptory challenge and the juror doesn't actually sit, then the defendant has not suffered the sort of harm that warrants reversing his conviction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1224.648" offset="5044989">Most of the courts that have adopted a rule of automatic reversal for these sorts of errors in the peremptory challenge process have relied on Swain v. Alabama and on dictum that appears in that decision in which the court said that the denial of the peremptory challenge is so important that it warrants a reversal without any further showing of error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.453" offset="5128163">Now Swain, of course, didn't involve any question of an infringement of the defense peremptory challenges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.563" offset="5152614">That statement had no relationship to the facts of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.824" offset="5165675">But Swain was citing and relying on cases from the 19th century that had reversed convictions without any inquiry into whether there was harmful error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.310" offset="5207575">Those decisions all preceded the enactment of the Federal harmless error statute and the Federal harmless error rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.194" offset="5239131">And it's our submission that that dictum, which was not authoritative in the case in which it was announced in any event, should not be followed by this Court today because the approach taken in Federal law is that if an error does not have the sorts of harms that warrant reversal, it shall be disregarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.159" offset="5314991">Now, there are two ways to look at the problem of harmless error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.774" offset="5329410">One is to say, is there a...  is there a perceptible effect on the...  on the outcome of the case?</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.635" offset="5352921">When all that you have is the denial of a peremptory challenge, there is no way to say that there is a perceptible effect on the outcome of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.295" offset="5391582">That kind of analysis applies when there is evidence that shouldn't have been admitted but was admitted or evidence that was excluded that should have been let in to the case, and it's possible to make an analysis of the entire record and determine whether there was injurious error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.096" offset="5458769">The other category of harmless error analysis is what the Court has sometimes referred to as structural error which is the sort of fundamental deprivation of the basic elements of the trial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.696" offset="5505162">And in that context, the Court does not look to see whether there is an effect on the outcome of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.640" offset="5528881">Reversal is automatic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.293" offset="5535569">The Ninth Circuit has sorted out this error into the structural error box.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.039" offset="5554481">The Government's position is that was wrong, that there is no way to categorize this error on the level of the errors that merit treatment as structural error.</text>

            <text syncTime="3416.504" offset="13812414">There are many things that a trial judge can do in orchestrating jury selection that have effects on the defendant's peremptory challenges that are equally severe, if not more severe than this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.930" offset="13862047">The trial judge, can in a multi-defendant case require all the defendants to exercise their peremptory challenges together without extending any additional challenges so that each defendant is reduced down from the number, in effect, of 10 provided in the rule to 5 because he's sharing with another defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.969" offset="13934250">The trial judge can require the parties to select the jury by exercising their challenges simultaneously, which is in fact what happened in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.885" offset="13969881">And in that event, the defendant may exercise his challenges against somebody who would have been removed by the Government in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.367" offset="13995794">And the trial judge can say to the parties, you must make a challenge for cause and then instantaneously, if it's denied, exercise a peremptory challenge, and if you do...  don't do that, you may not challenge that juror.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.089" offset="14042710">Each of these entirely legitimate procedures may from the defendant's point of view, infringe what would otherwise be his free and untrammeled right to exercise peremptory challenges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.286" offset="14083461">The rule that we ask for here, which is that if the defendant does actually exercise his peremptory challenge to remove a juror who should have been removed for cause, he cannot claim error on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.516" offset="14128392">He has been given the substance of the right and there is no basis for reversing the conviction.</text>
