            <text syncTime="15.343" offset="208165">This case is about the erosion of the jury by the New Jersey legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.478" offset="228645">The statute at issue in this case violates the Fourteenth and Sixth Amendments by permitting the judge to consider or assess a defendant's mental state by a preponderance of the evidence and sentence that person to a term of up to double the time permitted upon conviction of the predicate crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.510" offset="320805">Here, petitioner pled guilty to three crimes, but was sentenced on four.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.433" offset="348494">In Jones v. the United States, this Court constructed a proposed test for constitutionality of the statute as to determine whether the statue creates a separate element of a crime or a sentencing factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.477" offset="420697">Any fact, other than prior conviction, which increases the maximum sentence, implicates constitutional protections of beyond a reasonable doubt, notice by--</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="80.368" offset="468240">Well, what do you do with the capital sentencing schemes in a State like Arizona, for example, where a person can be convicted of first degree murder and then the judge does the sentencing and is allowed to increase the sentence to a death penalty, set it at death, if it was done for, let's say, pecuniary gain, some factor that the judge determines, and this Court has upheld that kind of a scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.006" offset="602822">Now, under your theory that, too, would be invalid if we were to accept what you've just been saying.</text>

I'm not intimately familiar with Arizona, but it is the States with which I am familiar, those penalties would be within the maximum and call for proof beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury before the judge sentences.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="145.125" offset="727270">But in Arizona the jury simply finds a person guilty of first degree murder and leaves the option of life imprisonment, or death, to the judge, so that clearly the judge is imposing a sentence that was perhaps within the range the jury... but it could just as easily have been life.</text>

            <text syncTime="1681.153" offset="6871374">The New Jersey legislature has made clear, and the New Jersey supreme court has confirmed, that the extended term provision of the hate crime statute which addresses motive is a sentencing factor, and not an element of the predicate offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.561" offset="6924978">Motive, as this Court has recognized over 100 years ago, may be probative of guilt, but it is not essential to a conviction unless the legislature chooses to include it as an element of a particular offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="3127.867" offset="12658228">But it must be remembered that a legislature has wide right to define crimes and to punish them very severely, so the question to be asked, to take Justice Scalia's hypothetical, for instance, from his dissent in Monge, of the statute that says, any intentional causing of harm is a crime, and everything else is a sentencing factor, you have to start with the supposition that the legislature could not enact that offense just as a crime and then say, it is a crime, and the sentence is up to life imprisonment or death in appropriate cases, and the judge decides.</text>

            <text syncTime="3491.734" offset="14113667">Mr. Chief Justice, I would like, unless the Court has additional questions, to limit my rebuttal to a question posed by Justice Thomas concerning the distinction between element of a crime and a sentencing factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.029" offset="14182943">As we know, the statute in question says the defendant, in committing the crime, acted with a purpose to intimidate because of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.385" offset="14220351">That seems to me that the... if we want to address what the legislature in New Jersey used by choice, the word purpose instead of the word motive, it seems that where purpose or intent is an ingredient of the statute, as it is here, that's a question as to the existence of that motive or intent, and that has to be a jury question, and I think that's the difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.618" offset="14325258">There is a denial by the New Jersey legislature of the defendant's right to have a jury decide this issue of purpose in intimidating a person because of race.</text>
