            <text syncTime="52.927" offset="356311">The issue in this case is whether ERISA provides a cause of action for appropriate equitable relief against a party in interest who engages in a prohibited transaction with an ERISA plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="1038.401" offset="4298189">Congress enacted the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA to protect plan assets from overreaching by parties and persons who deal with the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.227" offset="4345523">Under section 502(a)(3) recovery of plan assets from parties in interest who obtained assets through a prohibited transaction is appropriate equitable relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.535" offset="4394737">The penalty and tax provisions of ERISA make clear that the preference is for disgorgement of such assets from a party in interest who receives such assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.506" offset="4450639">To enforce those provisions, the Secretary of Labor goes to court under a virtually identical provision, 502(a)(5) to enforce the restitution, and under (a)(6) to enforce the penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.385" offset="4510094">Justice Breyer, you had been inquiring about the reach of the prohibited transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.051" offset="4544785">I think it might be useful, to understand it, to take a look at some of the exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.442" offset="4562339">For example, at joint appendix page 246 there's a general exemption for contracting or making reasonable arrangements with a party in interest for things like office space, legal, accounting or other services, so long as it's no more than a reasonable compensation is paid.</text>

            <text syncTime="1148.992" offset="4740494">And where you talk abut the other enforcement provisions, it's the Secretary doing it, so we have a screen that would screen out the legal claims that are not quite well founded and just represent an effort to get your money back.</text>

            <text syncTime="1207.812" offset="4975805">That's crucial to the enforcement of the Secretary of Labor, and the language is identical in relevant respects, and the statute makes quite clear that that is the priority of recouping the assets to the plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="3473.124" offset="14037056">It's prohibited transaction exemption 75-1, and that actually I think answers the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.540" offset="14066731">It is cited in respondent's brief... let's see... yes, it's in the Federal Register, but basically it shows how many of these transactions are clearly subject to an exemption, and it's not going to cause great difficulties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.656" offset="14159204">Basically, under this exemption, if a security is sold at the market price you're basically in a safe harbor.</text>

            <text syncTime="3543.092" offset="14316879">That is, the parties in interest are not only subject to the taxes and the civil penalties, but everywhere in the country, except now recently in the Seventh Circuit they have been subject to these suits by the Secretary and by fiduciaries, and by parties, participants and beneficiaries, and it has not caused great problems, so we've been essentially running an experiment with this, and it's been... it's not been a problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="3581.487" offset="14470479">Another situation that comes up is if assets are paid by mistake to a participant or a beneficiary, and this can... is supposed to be a one time lump sum, and suppose the computer gets misprogrammed, and instead of paying out $100,000 once it starts paying out $100,000 every month.</text>
