I know that's your argument, but I didn't follow it entirely because it seems to me if you suspend the decree and it doesn't become operative again until all the findings that have been made... all the findings required by the new act had been made, how is that different from just starting fresh and making those findings?</text>
            <text syncTime="238.885" offset="955455">It seems to me to say suspended is kind of a euphemism for terminated because you don't get it back again unless you establish what you would have to establish to get a decree under the new law in the first place.</text>

            <text syncTime="1227.657" offset="4910602">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.451" offset="4969744">In light of the rule that it takes a clear statement to deprive a court of its traditional equitable powers, the PLRA's automatic stay, 3626(e)(2), does not remove a court's traditional equitable power to prevent irreparable harm while an action is pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.667" offset="5050619">When prison officials move under the PLRA to terminate prospective relief, the (e)(2) stay comes into effect in the ordinary case if the termination motion can't be resolved in 30 or, on extension, 90 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.894" offset="5111536">But nothing in the statute purports to strip a court of its power to grant extraordinary interim relief to either party if it finds the party is likely to succeed on the merits and will otherwise suffer irreparable harm, but it will take more than 90 days to decide the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.584" offset="5178305">And construing the statute to take away that power, of course, would raise the serious constitutional question about the power of Congress to suspend a final judgment of an Article III court without giving the court any role in the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.150" offset="5244552">Several features of the statute support this interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.474" offset="5261793">First, the words, automatic stay and the motion shall operate as a stay, are commonly used to describe a default rule for the normal case, the rule that governs unless a court decides otherwise, not a rule that courts can't change.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.006" offset="5335980">There are other automatic stays in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.120" offset="5348415">The bankruptcy stay was apparently the model for this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.824" offset="5363252">Federal Rules of Civil Procedure establish an automatic 10-day stay of judgment in many cases, and as one Senator noticed in discussing this provision, it's common under State law for the State to get an automatic stay pending a government appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2161.297" offset="8645172">But, yes, there is a... there are... there are numerous injunctions that have the kind of complexity that would make a 90-day resolution difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.957" offset="8683729">The other thing I want to say about this notion that Congress... the statute might be interpreted as simply cutting everything off and requiring the prisoners to start again is that that's what Congress rejected.</text>
