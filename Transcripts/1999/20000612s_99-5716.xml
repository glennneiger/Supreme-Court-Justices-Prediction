            <label>Justice Clarence Thomas</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="84327">The second case I have to announce is number 99-5716, Carter versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.073" offset="124556">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.419" offset="149947">Petitioner Floyd Carter entered a bank wearing a ski mask.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.198" offset="169068">He proceeded to jump over the teller counter and take almost $16,000 in cash from the teller drawers.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.813" offset="199579">He fled the scene but was apprehended later that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.030" offset="216402">A federal grand jury indicted petitioner on a violation of Section 2113(a) of Title 18 of the U.S. Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.316" offset="265512">That Section punishes a person who by force and violence or by intimidation takes anything of value and possession of any bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.535" offset="302397">At trial petitioner did not contest the basic facts of the episode but contended that the taking was not facilitated by force or intimidation as Section 2113(a) requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.081" offset="356627">In the hope of giving the jury an option of convicting him on the less severe crime described by Section 2113(b) which does not require force or violence, petitioner requested that the Trial Court instruct the jury that it could convict him under Section 2113(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="88.461" offset="438129">The Trial Court declined to give such an instruction and the jury instructed on Section 2113(a) alone returned a guilty verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.475" offset="478149">The Third Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.437" offset="485986">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we affirm the judgment of the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.384" offset="505839">Under our decision in Schmuck versus United States, a defendant who requests an instruction on a lesser offence under Rule 31(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, must demonstrate that the lesser offence is a lesser included offence of the charged offence, i.e. the defendant must show that the elements of the lesser offence are a subset of the elements of the charged offence.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.127" offset="612732">Here the lesser offence described by Section 2113(b) fails this test, because it requires three elements that are not required by the charged offence that is under Section 2113(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="147.654" offset="674903">First, Section 2113(b) unlike Section 2113(a) requires that the defendant act with intent to steal or purloin.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.346" offset="721610">Second, Section 2113(b) again unlike Section 2113(a) requires that the defendant carry away the property after he has taken it.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.671" offset="770929">Third, Section 2113(b) in its first paragraph requires that the property taken have a value exceeding $1,000, Section 2113(a) by contrast contains no valuation requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.203" offset="833101">Petitioner advances several principles of statutory construction that are asserted to point in a different direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.837" offset="867583">We agree that the ordinary principles of statutory interpretation are applicable in this context, but conclude that they do not in this case warrant a departure from what is indicated by a straightforward reading of the text.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.278" offset="929336">The opinion discusses petitioners, various statutory arguments in detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.377" offset="949816">I will describe briefly his primary argument that Section 2113(b) should be deemed a lesser included offence of Section 2113(a) because these offences resemble the common law crimes of larceny and robbery respectively, and the common law treated larceny as a lesser included offence of robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.073" offset="1036543">We agree with petitioner that larceny and robbery bore this relationship at common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.070" offset="1060575">However, we do not find the common law relevant to the interpretive task at hand, because our cases instruct that the common law is a guide only when the statute uses a term with established meaning at common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.550" offset="1122433">Neither the term robbery, nor the term larceny appears in the text of Section 2113.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.322" offset="1149600">Although the word robbery appears in Section 2113â€™s title, the title of a statute is of use only to clarify ambiguity in the text of the statute and petitioner does not claim there is any such ambiguity.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.344" offset="1209682">Justice Ginsburg has filed a dissenting opinion which Justices Stevens, Souter and Breyer have joined.</text>
