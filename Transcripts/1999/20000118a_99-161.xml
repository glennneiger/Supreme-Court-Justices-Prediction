            <text syncTime="1861.137" offset="7589422">No, but what he's thinking of, I think, is the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.413" offset="7598513">There are two situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.378" offset="7606454">Situation one is when an appeal court looks at the whole record and says, look, there just isn't enough evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.360" offset="7642294">Okay?</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.614" offset="7647309">Defendant, you win.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.788" offset="7656086">Now, in that situation, they can say no new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.530" offset="7671029">Then there's a second situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.251" offset="7681895">It's where they look at the whole record and the whole testimony or half of it is Mr. Smith's, and they say Mr. Smith shouldn't have been admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.751" offset="7719930">And for that reason, he concedes they can give summary judgment to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.205" offset="7745739">But if it's that situation, for purposes of a new trial possibility, they ought to let the trial judge decide it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.772" offset="7783982">Now, I think that's what they're saying, and that leaves room for Neely and for the rule because it's saying not always.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.795" offset="7820031">If you have the kind of record where it had nothing to do with excising a witness, then of course the trial judge can, though it doesn't have to, just give summary judgment outright.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.294" offset="7870082">The trial... the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.281" offset="7878023">But if it's this other situation, which is theirs, then they should let the district court go first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.251" offset="7905922">Now, that's why they didn't think Neely was relevant, that relevant, et cetera, and that's why they kept saying... talked about a truncated record, et cetera.</text>
