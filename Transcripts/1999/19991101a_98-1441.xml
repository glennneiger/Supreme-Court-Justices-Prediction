            <text syncTime="3357.276" offset="13579264">First, with regard to the Harvey issue, Harvey is a California case which states that a sentencing court cannot rely on facts which are related solely to accounts dismissed pursuant to a plea bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.148" offset="13666826">However, in this case, the sentencing court relied on facts that were related to the murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.113" offset="13690650">For example, it relied on the fact that the respondent was armed and the victim was not, and that's at J.A. 40, at joint appendix, page 40.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.450" offset="13723982">Also, with respect to the Harvey issue, opposing counsel mentioned that the prosecutor used...  factually went into the dismissed counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.315" offset="13763479">Even assuming this is correct, it is irrelevant, because the Harvey standard pertains to the trial court's actions and, again, the trial court didn't rely on any facts solely related to the dismissed counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.502" offset="13808201">With respect to the Alford issue, I'd like to make two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.845" offset="13825546">First of all, Alford involved factual innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.878" offset="13837667">The defendant claimed he didn't shoot anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.421" offset="13851877">This is not the same claim in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.091" offset="13866506">In this case, Mr. Ortega made the claim in his California supreme court petition that he was only guilty of manslaughter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.968" offset="13898062">Well then, manslaughter theory should have been pursued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.100" offset="13910601">Also, opposing counsel stated that a judge taking the plea under Alford must resolve the conflict between the guilty plea and the claim of innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.328" offset="13963473">Actually, the trial judge did this in effect because the defense attorney stated why the guilty plea was being entered despite the claim of innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.339" offset="14027525">This is at J.A. 26-27, pages 26-27 of the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.982" offset="14050095">The court asked, So, counsel, I understand that this plea is made under People v. West, which is California's analogue to Alford.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.419" offset="14079874">Is that correct?</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.127" offset="14082695">Defense attorney, That is correct, and I did write on the form, the change of plea form, and I went over with Mr. Flores this morning numerous times the explanation that was given for his change of plea, and that is that if he goes to trial there was the risk that he could be found guilty of crimes for which he could receive more severe sentences, and that is the reason that Mr. Flores is pleading guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.621" offset="14168691">So there's the explanation for why the defendant entered his plea despite his claims of innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.926" offset="14193873">He wanted to avoid a more severe sentence, and Alford allows that.</text>
