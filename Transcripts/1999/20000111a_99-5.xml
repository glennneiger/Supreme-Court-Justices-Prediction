            <text syncTime="737.128" offset="3092674">A murder statute would be far more difficult to defend under Lopez, but without knowing what Congress found and what the factual premises were for such a statute and whether it was preemptive or... or complementary I'm not able to say, as an a priori matter, constitutional or unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.638" offset="3178669">But our defense of this statute doesn't rely on a conclusion that that would be constitutional for the following reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.030" offset="3212210">In Lopez, this Court explicated what we take to be a four part test in judicial scrutiny of legislation that Congress passes under the substantial effects prong of the Commerce Clause, but which is not itself either economic or commercial or part of a legislative effort to regulate or protect the specific market.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.004" offset="3316178">And Lopez was the first such case that this Court considered, and this one is quite arguably the second.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.521" offset="3342196">And what the Court said in Lopez, as we understand it in both the majority opinion, joined by five Justices, and in the concurring opinion that you... that you authored, was that Congress must... the Court must independently find four things: first, that Congress did act to protect interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.998" offset="3420145">In Lopez, it was not at all clear that that was true.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.521" offset="3434251">The act didn't even regulate violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.496" offset="3442088">It regulated possession and only within a school.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.273" offset="3457239">It looked much more like an effort to regulate what schools should be doing.</text>

            <text syncTime="854.024" offset="3560266">The Court must find that Congress had a rational basis to conclude that the regulated activity substantially affected commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.058" offset="3600390">Third, the Court itself must find independently... and this I think is an innovation of Lopez... that the harm on Congress was direct and not attenuated when the activity being regulated is not itself economic.</text>

            <text syncTime="963.061" offset="3996406">And let me answer that question and then explain the essential distinction with the murder statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.255" offset="4017200">Here Congress could have put a jurisdictional requirement that the act of gender motivated violence affect commerce or substantially affect commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.163" offset="4056801">And under Lopez, there would be no question of Congress' constitutional authority to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.083" offset="4076445">But we submit that it is both not constitutionally necessary under Wirtz and the... Perez and the other cases that suggest that under the substantial effects test, it is appropriate for Congress to regulate where the class of activities substantially affects interstate commerce rather than the particular discrete action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.700" offset="4170904">And that's really important here in terms of the effectiveness of this remedy for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.528" offset="4194205">One... the two reasons that are quite specific to gender based violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.118" offset="4212596">One, there are many instances of gender based violence that don't take place in the work place or on the way to work that in fact, in and of themselves and in the fear that they instill in women, have a substantial effect on the interstate economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.020" offset="4284171">And some of them were mentioned by my colleague.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.200" offset="4292948">If I can go... and therefore, we think that a jurisdictional element in this case as, for example, didn't exist in Perez or in Wirtz or, for that matter, really even in Heart of Atlanta Motel, because Congress in that case simply decreed that any commercial establishment that accepted a transient guest sufficiently affected commerce... so, we don't think it's necessary, and we don't think it would be as effective.</text>

            <text syncTime="1845.768" offset="7527221">The question in this case is whether the enumeration of congressional powers in the Constitution provides principled, substantive limits to those powers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1868.472" offset="7618023">With respect to the Commerce Clause, this Court has not yet held that Congress can regulate any violent crime non economic in scope and without any jurisdictional element tying it to interstate commerce in the specific instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.595" offset="7678522">With respect to section 5, this Court has not yet held that Congress can remedy violations of the section 1 prohibition against State denials of equal protection by regulating purely private behavior that could not possibly violate section 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.622" offset="7750620">Under these theories, Congress could justify laws... virtually any laws... in domestic relations law, crime, tort, areas that are traditionally governed by State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.110" offset="7800566">And as Justice Scalia noted earlier, because the power to regulate is the power to preempt, Congress could occupy the fields in these areas and relegate the States to a trivial and unimportant role in our Federal structure.</text>
