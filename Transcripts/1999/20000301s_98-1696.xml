            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="10.080" offset="124349">In order to give sentencing judges more flexibility and discretion in the federal criminal system, Congress allows sentencing courts and sometimes directs sentencing courts to impose a term of supervised release.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.023" offset="180146">As a general rule, that supervised release term begins when the convicted person is released from the prison, and supervised release is intended to assist individuals in their transition to community life.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.398" offset="241691">In the case before us for example, the District Court ordered that after the respondent's prison term ended, he was to serve a three-year term of supervised release on account of certain drug possession offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.455" offset="289860">The respondent was required among other conditions to avoid transporting firearms and to participate in a drug dependency program while he was on the supervised release.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.724" offset="330925">Now in some cases, though fortunately not often, it turns out that a prisoner has served too much time in prison, too much time in actual custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.605" offset="374497">That occurred in this case when some, but not all of the respondent's convictions were invalidated.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.918" offset="395709">When the convictions were set aside, it was determined that the respondent at once should be released from incarceration and he was.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.843" offset="419428">The question then became what if anything to do about the length of the term of the supervised release?</text>
            <text syncTime="89.036" offset="440221">Supervised release arguably was still applicable, because there were some convictions that were not set aside to prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.451" offset="465821">Respondent argued that he should receive credit for the extra time served in prison on the invalid convictions thus reducing the length of the supervised release term.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.457" offset="505945">The Courts of Appeals are divided on the issue and in the instant case the United States Court Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, agreed with the offender and ordered that the supervised release term be reduced by the amount of the extra prison time served.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.191" offset="552861">We now reverse, the controlling statute directs that the term of supervised release does not commence until an individual is released from imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.381" offset="589642">Consistent with the statute text, we hold there is no authority to order reduction that the respondent seeks here.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.043" offset="612211">Our conclusion accords with the statute purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.621" offset="622556">Supervised release fulfills rehabilitated needs quite distinct from the ends served by incarceration.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.578" offset="654425">Accordingly we find in the Court of Appeals erred in treating respondent's time in prison as interchangeable with the term of supervised release.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.321" offset="685354">Now, there could be no doubt that equitable considerations of great weight exist when an individual is incarcerated beyond the proper expiration of his prison term</text>
            <text syncTime="159.532" offset="722239">And the statutory structure pertaining to supervised release terms provides two specific means to address these concerns in large part.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.196" offset="752855">On remand the respondent may pursue relief under these provisions of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.401" offset="769678">The opinion of the Court is unanimous.</text>
