            <text syncTime="76.398" offset="453026">California Government Code section 6254(f)(3) requires Government agencies to provide access to the addresses of arrestees and crime victims in only a few instances, none of which include commercial solicitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.974" offset="511331">The statute in this respect is similar to at least 80 laws from around the country that limit access to a wide variety of Government records, including campaign finance reports, welfare records, accident reports, and even the personal financial disclosure forms of the members of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.602" offset="581862">Respondent contends that subsection (f)(3) is a speech restriction, but the text of the statute, which I want to spend just a couple of minutes focusing on, shows that plainly is not true, and it is reprinted in the appendix to the blue brief at page 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.029" offset="635570">One point to make at the outset is that subsection (f)(3) limits access to only addresses, not any of the other information that the State has about crimes and about crime victims and about arrestees, but subsection (f)(3), regarding the addresses of both the victims and the arrestees--</text>

            <text syncTime="1324.610" offset="5445862">Well, I think your question certainly gets to the heart of the case, which is that this case is about, in the first instance, access, who can have access.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.863" offset="5478881">In the second instance, it does impose a use restriction on people who are allowed to have access under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.350" offset="5500824">So fine, let's start with the restriction, the condition on access, and the cases that your question brings to mind are, for instance, the rape shield cases if you want to call them that, BJF, Cox Broadcasting, cases where information was released to the general public, is the way the Court characterized it, and in fact what the Court said was that it was released without qualification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.383" offset="5596954">That was crucial to the Court's... the majority's holding in Florida Star v. BJF.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.620" offset="5621927">I think I'd like to focus on that, because what the Court did not say is that when the Government has information that it is under no strong form of constitutional compulsion to make public, generally public, the Court did not say that it may not condition its release of that information in certain ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.398" offset="5685039">And what California has done here is to say, look, we have some information in our files.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.266" offset="5700504">We would like to make it available for certain purposes but not others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.068" offset="5715759">That is not a general release even when you give it to the press, because what they've said to the press is, you, too, may use it for journalistic purposes but not to sell a product or service, and let me give content to that by saying in our view what that would mean is, the L.A.

            <text syncTime="1438.883" offset="5903005">Now, if we were in a world of heightened... of the most heightened First Amendment scrutiny, presumably that would not be enough, because we don't say the Government can proceed one step at a time normally in a true heightened scrutiny case, but this is not a true heightened scrutiny case, because this is not a case where what the Government has said is, you have information and you may not publish it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3465.376" offset="14008905">Or just tell the next-door neighbor in a leaflet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.378" offset="14016951">I have very little time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.511" offset="14021444">I'd like to make two brief points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.813" offset="14026669">The first is, a late concern has been raised about computerized data banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.448" offset="14045268">The Ninth Circuit found that was completely speculative, no evidence there were such data banks in the 13 years when this law allowed access.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.121" offset="14075883">But more important is, this statute allows everybody to get the name, occupation, and date of birth, and the date of birth is a far better identifier than the current address for data bank purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.111" offset="14131890">Second, Justice Souter asked about the intrinsic value of this speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.165" offset="14148086">I think that it has intrinsic value, because it identifies the precise person named John Jones who has been arrested and charged with a particular crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.771" offset="14190509">The fact that it's not just instrumental is made clear by the fact that newspapers publish the address information.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3517.961" stopTime="3522.079">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3517.961" offset="14219243">Sure, but isn't the instrumental/intrinsic value distinction one which ultimately dissolves?</text>

            <label>Mr. Bruce J. Ennis, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3522.079" offset="14235753">I think it does.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Mr. Bruce J. Ennis, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3523.998" offset="14243485">I mentioned that the scheme plainly fails the fourth prong of the Central Hudson test because there is an opt-out alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.755" offset="14286430">The petitioner and the United States don't even discuss that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.957" offset="14307224">They don't say, why would it not be sufficient to allow arrestees to opt out, as the same statute allows victims to opt out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.479" offset="14345362">They don't discuss it because there's no answer to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.181" offset="14356125">I finally want to say that they've also raised at the last minute a discrimination argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.886" offset="14394995">That argument does not stop discrimination by employers if they get the address information from newspapers or private investigators.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.809" offset="14430731">Furthermore, the name and date of birth would be sufficient for most employers, who are going to track potential employees by name, to discriminate against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.098" offset="14471795">Third, it's an entirely speculative justification, no evidence in the record to support it and, finally, the Government could directly prohibit the use of this information by anyone to discriminate in employment, and that would not be a speech restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.758" offset="14530518">Thank you.</text>
