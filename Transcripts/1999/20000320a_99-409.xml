            <text syncTime="33.304" offset="284252">In the century preceding the enactment of the Bankruptcy Code in 196... 1978, this Court and other Federal courts recognized and enforced the rule that an unpaid administrative claimant in a bankruptcy case can come to court and have his or her claim paid if the expense benefited the secured party.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.635" offset="373591">The Federal courts also recognized the rule that a trustee who pays a claim may come and seek to charge the secured party's collateral if there was a benefit to the secured party.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.292" offset="420298">In enacting section 506(c) of the Bankruptcy Code, Congress recognized the right of the trustee, and the issue before the Court today is whether Congress' recognition of the right of the trustee was therefore intended to abrogate the other pre-code practice, which is that the administrative claimant could come to court and have the claim paid.</text>

            <text syncTime="86.939" offset="498874">So you're simply arguing that if the code says nothing, the pre-code practice applies, notwithstanding something like 506(c)?</text>

            <text syncTime="97.664" offset="541715">As the Court stated 2 years ago in the Cohen case, cited in our brief, at 523 U.S. at 221, we will not read the Bankruptcy Code to erode past bankruptcy practice absent a clear indication that Congress intended such a departure.</text>

            <text syncTime="130.735" offset="673999">As this Court made clear in the Wilson case, which we cite in our brief, the rule which this Court recognized was that the unpaid administrative claimant could come forward and have the claim paid.</text>

            <text syncTime="988.311" offset="4104294">It is the Louisville case, Louisville Storage Company case, 21 F.

            <text syncTime="1862.649" offset="7601672">I may be wrong about that, because I think it was the first question in the argument, where Hartford indicated it had asked the trustee to proceed and the trustee had refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.589" offset="7641483">In the blue brief at page 5, note 4, it is stated, Hartford did not request the trustee to pursue its claim under section 506(c) because the law in the Eighth Circuit as it existed at that time permitted administrative claimants to pursue such claims on their own behalf, citing the Boatmen's case, which was overruled by the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.268" offset="7724134">In fact, not even that is really so.</text>

            <text syncTime="1948.587" offset="7945444">The one thing Hartford could have done, I believe, although I don't intend to tell them how to run their business in any... and I don't mean this in any way derogatorily or in a pejorative manner... would have been to have some procedures in place so that they would have known, even though the debtor... I have no evidence that the debtor did notify them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.984" offset="8022975">Bankruptcy is and always has been somewhat creditor emptor, and it is true in this case that there's no evidence that Hartford was actually notified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.589" offset="8057457">There is evidence in this case on the record below that Hartford knew that it had a series of quarterly bills that were going unpaid, and so it couldn't have found out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.945" offset="8098835">Had Hartford known earlier, before the case was converted to a 7, and before the case was in a total liquidation mode, Hartford could have come to court, Hartford could have asked to terminate the policy based on nonpayment, at least cut its losses, and also Hartford could have tried to take steps to persuade the bankruptcy court perhaps while there were still funds in the estate to allow it within an administrative claim and force the payment of that claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.013" offset="8207086">Bankruptcy has a lot to do with timing, especially in a reorganization case that's going downhill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.451" offset="8232895">Hartford in fact is correct that it did not know until substantially later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.570" offset="8253375">If the Justice's question is, how could Hartford have protected itself after the fact, once we got to March of 1993, or whatever the record will show the date was that it learned, Hartford cannot protect itself under 506(c), I submit.</text>
