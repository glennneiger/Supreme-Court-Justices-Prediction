            <text syncTime="55.760" offset="365757">In Simmons v. South Carolina, this Court held that a capital defendant may rebut the State's allegation of future dangerousness by showing, if it is so, that he could never be paroled from prison on a life sentence if the jury gave him a life sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.079" offset="439005">Immediately after deciding Simmons, this Court reversed this case and remanded it to the Virginia Supreme Court for reconsideration in light of Simmons.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.826" offset="482054">The issue now presented is whether the Virginia Supreme Court erred when it effectively engrafted onto this Court's holding in Simmons an additional requirement that, in order to come within the ambit of Simmons, a defendant must not only have no possibility under State law of being released on parole throughout his entire lifetime, but also that that ineligibility have been formally declared on the day of his capital sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="3309.913" offset="13382365">That... that would solve the problem that you're worried about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.396" offset="13392291">But unfortunately, that isn't what we said in Simmons.</text>

            <text syncTime="3314.301" offset="13399919">Well, I'm really not worried about it because I don't think that... that this Court will restrict South Carolina in such a way.</text>

            <text syncTime="3322.954" offset="13434505">Well, that leads me to my last point, which is that Simmons has been accepted very comfortably by the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.639" offset="13461254">In fact, even before Simmons, there were very few State courts that did not go further than what Simmons held was required by due process, and now there are almost none.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.323" offset="13496049">Virginia itself no longer has this whole procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.540" offset="13508902">They now have eliminated parole for everybody and they tell everybody in every case whether future dangerousness is argued or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.756" offset="13545787">Yarborough v. Commonwealth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.021" offset="13550802">They have gone beyond Simmons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.459" offset="13556549">So, the... the issue of... of what was a small change in the law at the time of Simmons is no longer controversial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.393" offset="13588314">It is in repose, and I would suggest that it would be most unwise and most unfortunate for this Court to reawaken what was a small controversy 4, 5, 6 years ago and is now no controversy at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.467" offset="13644634">Thank you.</text>
