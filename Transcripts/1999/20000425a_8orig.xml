            <text syncTime="242.638" offset="1115061">Well, Mr. Minear, now the Government takes the position here with respect to the preclusion claim which the Master rejected; that is, the change of position on the part of the Government when the Interior Solicitor changed his mind.</text>

            <text syncTime="276.276" offset="1249644">Our argument has been simply the judgment does not have issue-preclusive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.430" offset="1270229">And the reason for that is that for a judgment to have preclusive effect, the issue underlying it must be actually litigated and determined, and that determination must be essential to the judgment that is entered.</text>

            <text syncTime="315.068" offset="1404811">Your Honor, the...  the State parties are referring to the provisions for claim preclusion that exist in the Indian Claims Commission Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.674" offset="1435218">And our understanding of that act is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.376" offset="1445980">That act dealt with the creation of a special commission, a Article I court, to resolve Indian claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.680" offset="1471267">And in the course of enacting the statute, Congress made quite clear what the preclusive effect of that administrative body's claims would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.016" offset="1500524">And that's, of course, an appropriate thing for Congress to do because, as this Court indicated in University of Tennessee v. Elliott, it's for Congress to determine what preclusive effect a...  an administrative body might have.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.907" offset="1548171">And our view is that the statutory preclusion that's provided is simply the equivalent of the merger in bar rules that would...  would apply to a judicial decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.632" offset="1587042">Now, that deals with the question of claim preclusion not issue preclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.251" offset="1605536">And what we have here with regard to the consent judgment is a question of...  the more narrow question of issue preclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.405" offset="1630091">There's no doubt that the judgment by the Claims Court precluded any further assertions by the tribe against the United States with respect to these lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.028" offset="1668648">The question that's presented here is whether it made a determination with regard to the status of the boundary lands.</text>

            <text syncTime="1449.678" offset="5943221">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.482" offset="5962447">The States of Arizona and California, the Coachella Valley Water District, and the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California all support Special Master McGarr's report and recommendations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.838" offset="6007900">We are pleased that we were able to resolve the 50-year-old water rights disputes on the Fort Mojave and Colorado River Reservations and obtain the Special Master's endorsement of those settlements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.745" offset="6055443">We urge the Court to approve them also, and further to adopt the Special Master's disposition of the Government's and the Quechan Tribe's additional water right claim for certain disputed boundary lands on the Fort Yuma Indian Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.671" offset="6115211">The Fort Yuma controversy over the title status to the 25,000 acres we've heard about, relating to a cession of those lands by the tribe under an 1893 agreement approved by Congress in 1894 and on which the tribes and the Government rely, has been with us almost for 100 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.484" offset="6190444">It was seemingly resolved in a 1936 decision by the Secretary of the Interior approving Solicitor Margold's opinion which found that the cession under the 1893 agreement was effective and had conveyed title to these lands to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.828" offset="6247809">Indeed, the tribe relied on that as a final decision by the Secretary in filing its 1951 petition with the Indian Claims Commission in which it sought compensation for what it called the wrongful expropriation of those 25,000 acres of land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.723" offset="6323355">The Government's answer to that position before the Indian Claims Commission asserted that the Government had title to those lands and indeed had performed all of its obligations under the 1893 agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.697" offset="6375287">The Government's later assertion of a winner's reserved water right for the Fort Yuma Indian Reservation when it intervened in Arizona I 2 years later in 1953 proceeded on that same premise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.392" offset="6438085">And this Court's decision in 1963 awarded the Government its full claim for the Fort Yuma Reservation for all the practicably irrigable acreage within the Fort Yuma Reservation as determined by the Secretary's 1936 decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.270" offset="6505585">20 years later in 1983, the tribe's Indian Claims Commission action finally culminated in a settlement judgment, approved by the Claims Court which awarded the tribes $ 15 million for, quote, all rights, claims, or demands which the tribe has asserted or could have asserted, closed quote, in that action which plainly included the tribe's claim for the taking of the disputed boundary lands.</text>

            <text syncTime="3122.149" offset="12633076">All Solicitor Krulitz did was take the...  the rejected legal theory that the Secretary didn't adopt in 1936 and belatedly apply it to the same facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.539" offset="12678633">That...  that just doesn't make any sense.</text>

            <text syncTime="3267.709" offset="13215293">Arizona I made clear that boundary land issues would not be determined in that litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.863" offset="13235982">So, we could not have raised the Quechan boundary land issue at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.232" offset="13249461">It simply wasn't available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.667" offset="13255208">In 1979, the Court made that clear.</text>

            <text syncTime="3293.593" offset="13318842">That's how Master Tuttle read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.795" offset="13327724">But what's explicit is the Court's 1979 decree where it makes clear that all five...  all five reservation boundaries remain open.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.501" offset="13362519">And I think that discloses the...  the claimed preclusion effect of this Court's past decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.103" offset="13380909">With regard to the issue-preclusive effect of the consent judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.924" offset="13396165">I'd like to make several points on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.126" offset="13405047">First of all, in answer to Justice Stevens' question about the change in position of the United States, since 1978, we have consistently taken a position with regard to these lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.148" offset="13445066">It's articulated in the 1978 and 1981 decisions of the Secretary, and we have continued to rely on those decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.920" offset="13480175">We have not suggested in any way that the boundaries that are laid out quite specifically in those orders have been renounced in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.324" offset="13505775">And in fact, our assertion of the water right throughout this whole period indicates that we believe the consequences of the judgment of the Claims Court was simply to preclude the claims against the tribe...  by the tribe against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.834" offset="13559796">The United States and the tribe agreed on who owned the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.786" offset="13575678">That's what led to the settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.286" offset="13581634">There is simply no longer a controversy after the 1978 decision that these lands were held by the tribe and that we were paying trespass damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.325" offset="13613817">The judgment doesn't say that, but if you look behind it, that's what you're going to find.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.944" offset="13628237">In that...  given that situation, we think the fair thing to do is to litigate this question of the validity of the Secretary's decision on the merits.</text>

            <text syncTime="3378.882" offset="13660002">It isn't just the judgment doesn't say it, it's also that one of the claims that they made was...  was the claim that was just inconsistent with the...  with the fact that they accepted the Solicitor's new opinion.</text>
