            <text syncTime="3493.369" offset="14115144">Correct, Your Honor, because, as we had addressed during my initial argument, Mr. Nelson's filing the Rule 59 motion would have been a special appearance, and he would not have been subject to the jurisdiction of the court by virtue of the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="3505.567" offset="14163941">In other words, the answer by motion or by answer to the complaint, Rule 12 is the rule in question, and Rule 12 says you can make a motion in advance of answering the complaint, or you can answer the complaint, so Rule 12 is set up to deal with the case where a complaint was filed, and then it says you respond to that complaint either by pre answer, motion, or by answer.</text>

            <text syncTime="3533.772" offset="14276790">How can you consider your first, your April 8 appearance a special appearance when you made two arguments, the first one of which is obviously to the merits, namely, section 285 does not allow an award of attorney's fees against an individual who engaged in inequitable conduct?</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.062" offset="14349933">That's certainly a general appearance.</text>
