            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="7.706" offset="30824">These cases come to us on writ of certiorari from the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.141" offset="56529">In 1996, Congress enacted the Prison Litigation Reform Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.899" offset="79517">All these things have acronyms; this one is called the PLRA, and as relevant here that PLRA establishes standards for the entry and termination of prospective relief in civil actions challenging prison conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.543" offset="154122">Specifically Section 3626(b) provides that prospective relief must be supported by findings and precisely tailored to what is needed to remedy the violation of a federal right.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.121" offset="212428">If prospective relief, under an existing injunction, does not satisfy these standards, the PLRA entitles a defendant or intervenor to immediate termination of the prospective relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.569" offset="274181">Under the automatic stay provision of the PLRA, the provision that is at issue in this case, a motion determinate prospective relief shall operate as a stay of that relief during the period beginning 30 days after filing of the motion which is extendable up to 90 days for good cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.012" offset="359967">The stay ends when the court rules on the motion for termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.187" offset="380656">In 1997, the Superintendent of the Pendleton Correctional Facility, which is currently operating under an ongoing injunction governing the conditions of confinement there, filed a motion to terminate the prospective relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.741" offset="446903">The District Court enjoined the automatic stay provision of the PLRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.684" offset="470727">The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed concluding that although the state provision precluded courts from using their equitable powers to enjoin the stay, the statue so construed was unconstitutional on separation of power’s grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.211" offset="540839">In an opinion filed with the Clerk of the Court today, we reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.807" offset="559125">The first question is whether the automatic stay provision precludes federal courts from exercising their traditional equitable powers to enjoin the automatic stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.862" offset="603429">We conclude that it does, the text of the statue unambiguously requires that the motion shall operate as a stay during a specific time period.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.168" offset="648568">Any construction of this language that allowed courts to use their equitable discretion to enjoin a stay would be plainly contrary to Congress’ intent because it would convert the mandatory stay into a discretionary one.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.924" offset="707605">Given this construction, we must address whether the stay provision offends separation of powers principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.446" offset="741773">In 1995, in a case called Plaut versus Spendthrift Farm, we held that a statue that required federal courts to reopen final judgments entered before the status’s enactment was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.345" offset="801332">We distinguished in that case, however, those situations in which the legislation altered the prospective effect of previously entered injunctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.198" offset="848771">We have held that prospective relief remains subject to alteration due to changes in the underlying law.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.858" offset="883357">Section 3626(b), if the PLRA changes the relevant underlying law by establishing new standards for the enforcement of prospective relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.171" offset="928601">By staying prospective relief that is no longer enforceable under the new standards, the stay provision merely reflects the change in the underlying law; it does not suspend or reopen a final judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.441" offset="981682">Consequently, we conclude that the stay provision does not offends separation of powers principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.387" offset="1005505">Justice Souter has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part which Justice Ginsburg has joined; Justice Breyer has filed a dissenting opinion joined by Justice Stevens.</text>
