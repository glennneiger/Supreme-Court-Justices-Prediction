            <text syncTime="1081.284" offset="4467579">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.844" offset="4509897">If this Court had held in the Qualitex case that color is an inherently distinctive source identifying characteristic of products, the Patent and Trademark Office would have been flooded with applications for color marks and we would have been well on our way to having color-coded industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.181" offset="4615223">And the expectations of consumers would, likewise, have been affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.561" offset="4640718">They would have begun thinking of color as source identifying more than they had prior to the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.485" offset="4668408">Instead, the Court looked toward the traditional remedial role of finding that secondary meaning had been established for the use of color on a particular product in a particular industry and someone was appropriating the good will in a way that was deserving of protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.565" offset="4748761">It's possible, in other words, for the courts to get too far out in front on these issues in interpreting the law, and there can be self-fulfilling prophecies of what becomes source identifying, and industries can become regimented into each producer having his own little niche.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.535" offset="4844578">That... that is the danger of too receptive a standard of inherent distinctiveness.</text>

            <text syncTime="3285.403" offset="13284114">But if you can design around it, if there's no reason for you to use specifically that, then it's not functional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.766" offset="13305535">There's a case in the Seventh Circuit that explains how the aesthetic functionality works, which is a cookbook case decided by Judge Posner, where he said, look, you want to have a cookbook big so that it opens up so you can read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.143" offset="13355063">You want to have big pictures and big print so you can read it while you're working at a counter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.705" offset="13369273">So, of course, you're going to end up with a picture... you're going to end up with a cookbook with big pictures and print, and in order to prevent the pictures from bleeding out onto the edges, you're going to have gold... gold edging.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.389" offset="13408039">So, of course, the cookbooks are going to look alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.391" offset="13420055">Well, that's aesthetic functionality, but that's not what's involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.251" offset="13439490">This case is quite different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.640" offset="13448999">If I might go on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.772" offset="13489541">There hasn't been any contention here that the jury wasn't appropriately instructed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.128" offset="13526948">The district judge specifically mentioned Seabrook by name in his analysis in the judgment as a matter of law opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.220" offset="13559340">The Second Circuit said, among other things... it said a lot of things that it didn't need to in our view, but one of the things that it said was the task of the court is to evaluate how unique and unexpected the claimed trade dress is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.802" offset="13609704">It also said that the jury looked at the dozens of garments before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.060" offset="13626736">It said that at least two or three times.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.498" offset="13636454">In making that analysis, I submit that if you do apply the Seabrook test, you must come to the conclusion that an affirmance is necessary in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3395.484" offset="13724434">The problem with an inherently distinctive test is... is that it is predictive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.953" offset="13742302">It attempts to determine in advance of the demonstration of secondary meaning what consumers would think, and we know from product configurations alone that they do not tell people source-indicating facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.188" offset="13803219">Rather, they tell consumers I'm a product.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.234" offset="13815445">It inherently describes the product.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.187" offset="13827252">In this case, application of a secondary meaning rule would work no harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.590" offset="13844806">Samara had had its products in the market for 5 or 6 years, the record evidence indicates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.532" offset="13868630">And what we're seeing with the amicus briefs proposing a very rigorous Seabrook test is that the same evidentiary burden is going to be put on mark owners, albeit it calling it a Seabrook burden, as has been done in the past with the secondary meaning test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.913" offset="13938116">But the Patent and Trademark Office has followed the secondary meaning test for many, many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.861" offset="13961939">They've got it down to a science.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.636" offset="13969045">Trademark practitioners know how to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.877" offset="13978031">We submit that's the right outcome here, that for product configurations, require secondary meaning.</text>
