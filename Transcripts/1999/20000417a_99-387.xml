            <text syncTime="15.016" offset="200588">The issue in the case before the Court this morning is whether taxing authorities should be subjected to shoulder the same burden of persuasion as other creditors in bankruptcy to prove the allowance of their claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.352" offset="253982">We think it's essential, in resolving that question, to note that the validity of claim under State law is not the same as the allowance of a claim under the Bankruptcy Code and under the Bankruptcy Act which preceded the code.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.977" offset="312497">This Court's prior decision in Vanston is illustrative of that dichotomy.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.352" offset="337992">Bankruptcy is fundamentally a process which realters and restructures debtor-creditor relationships.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.487" offset="370489">When matters of State law giving rise to rights between parties are at odds or are inconsistent with policies or procedures underlying the Bankruptcy Code, those aspects of State law give way.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.871" offset="436004">We argued in our brief that the general practice under the Bankruptcy Act was to require taxing authorities, like all other creditors, to shoulder the burden of persuasion to establish the allowance of their claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="138.299" offset="693780">When Congress enacted the Bankruptcy Code of 1978, the legislative history indicates that it gave careful consideration to the treatment of tax claims in bankruptcy estates.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.198" offset="733382">The legislative history that we cite in our brief, I believe on page 16, indicates that Congress was concerned about the interplay between creditor rights of ordinary trade creditor variety, consensual trade creditors, the interests of the debtor, and the interests of taxing authorities--</text>

            <text syncTime="249.398" offset="1138175">The code and the act before it were silent, Your Honor, and we do agree that because there was no decision from this Court under the Act it's proper for this Court to look at the rationale of placing the burden either on taxing authorities or on the objecting party under the Bankruptcy Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.253" offset="1213617">And if the Court determines that there wasn't a predominant practice under the Act, so that it was... Congress was deemed to have accepted that practice under the code, certainly practice under the Act and the legislative history under the code is illustrative of the concerns that Congress had, and I think it's helpful to this Court in reaching its decision as to where the burden of proof should lie.</text>

            <text syncTime="502.257" offset="2149636">And the argument for that, as I understand it, is, the taxpayer is usually the one who has the most easy access to the facts, and the easiest access to the evidence upon which ultimately the tax liability is going to depend, so if you take that argument, that by removing the burden of persuasion you really are taking away an element that goes very importantly to the validity, what is your response to that?</text>

            <text syncTime="566.737" offset="2407517">In a bankruptcy context this Court has found repeatedly it transfers claims against the debtor, legal claims against that debtor, to equitable claims against assets which comprise a bankruptcy estate.</text>

            <text syncTime="626.442" offset="2646276">If the Government has the burden, it doesn't have that much of a claim because it simply doesn't have access to the means of showing it, and so it seems to me that the meat of their argument really is not affected by the fact that we have a slight shift in the actual parties to the relationship here.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.790" offset="2735720">The meat of their argument is, the claim itself would be changed if you changed the burden, regardless of who happens to be fighting about it at a given time, and I'm not sure that you really responded to that.</text>

            <text syncTime="781.559" offset="3266841">--Justice Ginsburg, I think that the burden of proof attendant to tax claims is as much substantive of those claims as the burden of proof on any other claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.132" offset="3305084">Congress and State governments, State legislatures have decided that because of certain policy reasons the burden of persuasion on an assortment of different tax claims should be borne on the taxpayer rather than the taxing authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.977" offset="3352418">Those policy reasons are generally recordkeeping requirements, access to documentation, and knowledge about the underlying tax claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.683" offset="3379272">Those interests are not disserved by placing the burden of persuasion on a taxing authority in a bankruptcy estate because of the way claims are adjudicated in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.999" offset="3420546">Because the taxpayer has to come forth with credible evidence, hopefully supported by records, in order to counter the prima facie validity of the claim, we think those same purposes are served.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.297" offset="3465790">For example, in Landbank, the decision that holds that the burden of persuasion is on the taxpayer, on the objecting party in bankruptcy, in that case the taxing authority filed a proof of claim and based upon an estimated valuation of bad loss, bad debt losses, the objecting trustee said no, you should figure... you should determine bad debt losses based upon the actual accounting method, but the Court's opinion indicates that nobody had any records of what the bad debt losses under the actual accounting method was.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.472" offset="3582400">In that instance, the objecting creditor failed to rebut the presumption of the taxing authority's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.779" offset="3603716">The taxing authority's case in Landbank, the taxing authority would have won even if the burden of persuasion would have been on the taxing authority, because the debtor, without adequate records, without justifiable evidence to rebut the presumption, can't overcome the validity of the tax claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="1568.196" offset="6413342">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.984" offset="6432464">I'd like to begin by clearing up one area of potential confusion, and that has to do with the difference between, if there is a difference between the validity of a claim and the allowance of a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.913" offset="6484187">Mr. Radasevich said that validity is not the same as allowance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.886" offset="6500069">That is both true and untrue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.429" offset="6514280">Allowance can mean more than validity, certainly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.796" offset="6527759">There are reasons under section 502 of the code for disallowing a claim that have nothing to do with its validity, but validity is itself a reason for disallowing a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.967" offset="6568405">It was, in fact, the reason why the trustee in this case challenged the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.328" offset="6589826">It was the trustee's assertion that the Department of Revenue's claim was not valid under State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.154" offset="6613127">Under Illinois tax law, he contended, we did not have a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.034" offset="6632667">In that instance, validity is indeed the same as allowance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.526" offset="6646668">Now, to make matters more complicated and talk about how allowance is used in the Vanston case, under the Act, as opposed to under the Code, allowance meant something else again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.123" offset="6693062">It not only meant allowance in the sense that it's used in section 502, but it also incorporated notions of equitable subordination, so that the Vanston case... and I can't speak to why it wasn't cited in the Butner decision, but it was cited in the opinion that Justice Stevens wrote in Grogan v. Garner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.560" offset="6762756">In Vanston, the Court first observed that the validity of a claim... I believe they termed it existence, but that's really the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.099" offset="6804970">The existence of a claim is a matter of State law except where there is overruling Federal law, but the Court went on to say that essentially the equivalent of equitable subordination applied, and that is that it was unfair to allow these particular creditors interest on interest at the expense of other creditors, so in this case we are talking about allowance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.268" offset="6897653">We are also talking about validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.272" offset="6905698">The trustee in this case is asking the Court to do something that we contend is pretty radical and that is, in the face of congressional silence and ignoring the vital interest that States have in the integrity of their tax schemes, he's asking the Court essentially to fashion a Federal common law burden of proof only, apparently, for tax claims and only in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.059" offset="6992843">Under his rule, tax claims would be decided differently in bankruptcy court than in State court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2010.541" offset="8182773">It's, let's say the widows and orphans who are the other creditors, and they have no easier access to that taxpayer than you do.</text>

            <text syncTime="2636.820" offset="10687811">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.898" offset="10760118">Under our self-assessment and self-reporting systems of State and Federal taxation the traditional burden of proof on the taxpayer is not a peripheral matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.761" offset="10823648">It's essential to the successful functioning of tax authorities and to providing an incentive for the maintenance of adequate records to enable fair determinations of tax liabilities to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.539" offset="10898671">Now, the court of appeals was quite correct in pointing out that the code addresses burden of persuasion in a number of contexts but not with respect to burden of persuasion on tax claims, and referred to its silence as eloquent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.856" offset="10983935">Actually, there is perhaps something more than silence that implies an answer to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.283" offset="11025731">Tax claims arise in bankruptcy proceedings sometimes in the form of judgments that have been adjudicated by tax tribunals, whether State or Federal, but have not yet been paid, and sometimes as claims that have not been reduced to judgment, and in the section of the code, section 505 of title XI, entitled Determination of Tax Liability, Congress explicitly addresses the situation when a tax claim is reflected in a judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.976" offset="11196467">As the court of appeals pointed out, section (a)(1), subsection (a)(1) of section 505, a provision which is cited in the briefs but not set forth in the briefs, does give the... a bankruptcy court authority to determine the amount or legality of any tax except as provided in paragraph 2, and paragraph 2 of section 505(a) says that the bankruptcy court may not make that determination if the amount or legality has been contested before and adjudicated by a judicial or administrative tribunal of competent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.878" offset="11404089">Then that judgment is binding in the bankruptcy proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.360" offset="11433973">Now, two observations might be made about this in a search for congruity in administration of the bankruptcy proceedings themselves with respect to tax claims, first that by 1978, when these provisions were enacted in the code, it was very familiar where the burden of proof lies in these tax adjudications and Congress was comfortable in giving conclusive effect to those that have been adjudicated in a tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.068" offset="11588827">But the other, rather strong implication is that the bankruptcy court is being told it's bound by those determinations, but when those determinations have not been made by a tax tribunal, then the implication, it seems to us, is that the bankruptcy court should be acting as the surrogate for the tribunal that ordinarily makes these tax determinations and should try to reach the result that would otherwise be binding in the bankruptcy proceedings in the spirit of Erie Railroad v. Tompkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.410" offset="11762175">This is a question governed by tax law, whether State or Federal, in this case State tax law, and you try to reach the result that the tribunal that can speak authoritatively for the State government in this case which creates the tax claim would have reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.106" offset="11852977">What petitioner is arguing for is a rule that would encourage the reaching of disparate results, depending on which tribunal is making the determination, a return to a pre-Erie kind of administration of the law, which would destroy congruity in the achievement of results here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2960.959" offset="11984425">As I understand it, in choice of law generally the burden of persuasion would go with the substantive right, so if we were making a State-State judgment, and Illinois is applying the law of Indiana to a particular claim, with that law would go Indiana's burden of proof and not Illinois, so it's not just a vertical Erie, but a horizontal--</text>

            <text syncTime="2986.180" offset="12085258">Well, I'm just... I'm talking about the spirit of Erie.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.142" offset="12097169">Erie revolutionized our thinking about how tribunals should go about making determinations when they're really determining something that is law emanating from another jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.057" offset="12180761">They should try to achieve the determination that that jurisdiction would have achieved through its normal processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.319" offset="12209809">It's just an analogy that I'm drawing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.315" offset="12217855">I'm not saying that Erie controls this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.374" offset="12230080">What I am saying is that the petitioner is asking this Court to construe the Bankruptcy Code to encourage disparate results, depending on which tribunal has made the determination, when Congress quite explicitly said that if it has gone to determination before the normal tax tribunals which apply the normal burden of persuasion in tax cases, that will be binding in the bankruptcy proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.819" offset="12355886">There should be some reason before we should read the companion provision, which says nothing about burden of persuasion, to encourage the bankruptcy court, when it has to step in as the surrogate for the normal tax tribunals, to reach different results by applying different ways of determining the tax liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.020" offset="12464660">In fact, occasionally bankruptcy courts, when there's a particularly complicated tax question, will lift the automatic stay, as they're authorized to do to enable a tax court proceeding to go ahead to a conclusion because they feel that the tax court can make a more accurate determination on a complex tax issue, and then under this provision that will be the binding determination for the bankruptcy proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.898" offset="12600183">So what's really being advocated here is an incongruity in reaching results with respect to tax claims, because they often come before the court with a preexisting, embodied preexisting judgment which Congress has taken no chances on here, but has said will be binding, and it's barred the bankruptcy court from making any other determination with respect to the tax liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="3275.765" offset="13243631">The first three are instances where Congress allocated the burden to two separate parties in litigation on different things that were involved in the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.724" offset="13275501">Under section 547, as I discussed with Justice Ginsburg, the prima facie proof is on the plaintiff, the affirmative defenses are on the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.974" offset="13304444">Under section 362, dealing with modification of the automatic stay, the movant has certain burdens, the debtor has other burdens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.648" offset="13339135">Under section 363, dealing with the use, sale, and lease of property, the debtor has certain burdens where the trustee, the party asserting an interest in the property has other burdens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.355" offset="13373930">So Congress split the burdens because there were a bunch of things going on.</text>

            <text syncTime="3404.490" offset="13758557">And the other two code sections where Congress did specifically set forth the burden of persuasion, 1129 deals with the right unique to taxing authorities to trump plans if the plans are meant to defeat taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.328" offset="13809862">Rather than have the debtor prove the negative that a plan is not designed to defeat taxes, the taxing authority has to argue and prove it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.344" offset="13837969">Under 364, dealing with obtaining credit, the usual rules, you can obtain unsecured credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.519" offset="13858658">If you can't, subsection (b) says give them an administrative claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.999" offset="13872555">If that doesn't work, give them a superadministrative claim and a junior lien on assets.</text>

            <text syncTime="3451.312" offset="13945803">That's the exception to the rule, and Congress allocated a burden of persuasion dealing with that exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.603" offset="13967014">The usual rule in bankruptcy allocates the burden of persuasion to all parties.</text>
