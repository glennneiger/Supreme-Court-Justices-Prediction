            <text syncTime="65.759" offset="409441">Like WISPIRG had a referendum and the funds were paid by reason of the referendum, which it seems to me is not viewpoint-neutral.</text>

            <text syncTime="493.474" offset="2120252">It's a metaphorical forum.</text>

            <text syncTime="504.907" offset="2166019">One way, to be sure, is to look at it as a metaphorical forum, and another way is not to look at it as a forum and simply to look at it as a mechanism for funding various groups which have ideological and various partisan identifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.969" offset="2246267">One...  or the question in my mind is what reason is there to adopt the...  the forum metaphor rather than to look directly at who gets the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.819" offset="2293705">One reason that occurred to me would be that there was no other way or no practical way to have this sort of ferment of comment and...  and speech except in this fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.485" offset="2364340">And yet, that doesn't seem to be the case because I think...  what...  70 percent of the student organizations seem to get along without going through this process and availing themselves of the activity fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.201" offset="2415227">So, my...  I'm left with the question of why should we adopt the forum metaphor as opposed simply to looking to where the money goes.</text>
