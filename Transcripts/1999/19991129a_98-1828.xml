            <text syncTime="46.242" offset="332738">The additional issue, of course, is whether a private person has Article III standing to litigate claims of fraud against the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="196.613" offset="934181">So, that doesn't raise a standing issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.484" offset="941704">And then there's about three or four where the... the case can be brought into court by a... by an individual who's... who is a Federal official.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.476" offset="981620">Now, in that instance I think it's fair to regard that as a case that's brought by the United States by a Federal official notwithstanding the fact that Federal official can also claim part of the bounty.</text>

            <text syncTime="337.798" offset="1498949">But it's... but that certainly is not even remotely the case here where we have had some form of the so-called qui tam actions in various permutations.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.336" offset="1549104">They were very popular at the time of the first Congress, of course, fell into disuse, and... and really wasn't revived again until this formulation under the False Claims Act, which in and of itself fell into... into disuse between 1943 and 1986.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.042" offset="1631860">So, I don't think we have the situation here where we can look back and get a clear message from the historic record, whether it be from English common law or from our own American jurisprudence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2735.333" offset="11089022">The other point I wanted to make before I move on from Article III standing is that this Court's modern standing jurisprudence has been an effort to apply the case or controversy principles in the new context of modern public law litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.769" offset="11146805">But the... the ultimate inquiry is what is a case or controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.108" offset="11160180">Those are the constitutional terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.690" offset="11166449">And on that point, we think it's critical to look what the Founders meant by those terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.690" offset="11182540">And in fact, just several terms ago in the Steel Company case, the Court said that a case or controversy means cases and controversies of the sort traditionally amenable to and resolved by the judicial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.160" offset="11228411">And that classically describes qui tam actions which were in existence both before the adoption of the Constitution and after.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.950" offset="11255579">And the case or controversy provision in Article III was intended to have continuity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.384" offset="11273238">It is not, for example, like Marbury v. Madison which involved a... a new structural feature of our Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.327" offset="11297061">It... it refers to provisions of the Constitution in which the Framers intended continuity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.272" offset="11320780">On... on the statutory point, I'd like to make clear at the outset that there is no clear statement requirement in a situation involving the relationship between the United States and a State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.428" offset="11365502">This is not a situation in which Congress has abrogated a State's sovereign immunity on behalf of a private person.</text>

            <text syncTime="3529.652" offset="14266348">Let me just underscore one... one other point and that's the need for the plain statement rule here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.769" offset="14286828">This relator is claiming, just on civil penalties alone, a claim for 25 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.811" offset="14319011">That... that exceeds the total annual outlay for the Department of Environmental Conservation in the State of Vermont by about 7 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.498" offset="14353701">Now, clearly if that's what was implicated in this statute, there should be a plain statement rule so that we can be on fair notice that that is what has happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.031" offset="14387869">Your Honor, we submit that's not what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.942" offset="14395497">We ask the Court to reverse and dismiss this case.</text>
