            <text syncTime="9.934" offset="187619">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="26.957" offset="255642">18 U.S.C. 844(i) makes arson a Federal crime if it damages property used in interstate commerce or property used in any activity affecting interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.297" offset="305066">The question here is whether petitioner's arson of a private residence comes within the statute because that home received natural gas and was mortgaged and insured by out-of-state firms, and if so, whether that application of the statute to that crime is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.963" offset="367760">In the Government's view, the power to regulate interstate commerce enables Congress to make a Federal crime out of any act that threatens or damages property having connections to interstate commerce or that interrupts or disrupts an ongoing commercial relationship with out-of-state parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.047" offset="456053">That view of the Commerce Clause would enable Congress to enact general Federal protections for virtually all property, including real property, although the general protection of property is one of the most basic core elements of an area of traditional state concern and competence.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.930" offset="527629">In the Government's view of the Federal protection of property, the... Congress can make Federal crimes out of things like scrawling graffiti or breaking a window, and Congress has in... in the Government's view made Federal crimes out of setting fire to a gas barbecue grill or perhaps a television.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.314" offset="609131">And here, of course, the Government has prosecuted as a Federal crime, the arson of a private residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.732" offset="634835">The Government has not identified any limit on the Federal power to prohibit arson, although arson is a quintessentially local crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="205.294" offset="968994">And we think, in fact, it's quite telling that there was some concern among some Members of Congress that this statute did not reach private residences.</text>

            <text syncTime="228.863" offset="1063348">It is not... it may be used in a... in an abstract sense, but it is not a use of the physical property and it is the physical property that is really at issue here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3130.262" offset="12668925">And it's really redundant, attaching to the word vehicle, used in... you know, in any activity affecting interstate or foreign commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="3140.587" offset="12710199">It would have meaning as to the other two segments of the statute, but I think that you're right, Justice Scalia, that it would apply to all vehicles because of the gas and the movement of the gas in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.176" offset="12756592">Again, this Court's decision in Russell makes clear that it's not simply the activities of the occupants of the house that are relevant to determining whether it's used in an activity affecting interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.670" offset="12810509">And the economic distinction between renting property and mortgaging property is not likely one that would have prompted Congress to exclude the coverage of houses that are mortgaged while covering houses that are subject to rental agreements.</text>

            <text syncTime="3181.226" offset="12872785">Does it seem to you that the categories we've been discussing are really somewhat remote from what the Framers sought to accomplish when they set up the Federal system, which is to allow people to realize that there's a Government that's not remote from them that they can control?</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.437" offset="12945614">Here the sentence was for 30 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.061" offset="12960138">It's not clear in the record why this... this crime happened, but the homeowner himself argued before the sentencing court, as I understand it, that the sentence was too... too strong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.432" offset="13013637">And yet, this very remote Federal sentencing scheme comes into play in what is ordinarily a common law crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.896" offset="13047492">And none of the responses you've given, perhaps none of the questions we have asked, seemed to recognize that there is a strong, local interest here that's just simply being ignored.</text>

            <text syncTime="3237.454" offset="13097647">Well, I don't think that they're in any sense being ignored, Justice Kennedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.577" offset="13110186">In fact, the local authorities called upon the ATF to investigate this crime and actually requested that we take it over for prosecution because it involved a destructive device, a Molotov cocktail, in which the Federal resources and Federal experience was far greater and, therefore, was resolved in that manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.305" offset="13189075">This is typically the way that prosecution decisions are made under statutes like the arson statute that deliberately provide overlapping jurisdiction between Federal authorities and State authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.986" offset="13231812">There is collaboration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.486" offset="13237768">There's cooperation, and in the norm, there's agreement upon which body is the better to prosecute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.281" offset="13260964">And the fundamental issue I think here in Federal law enforcement and criminal law enforcement is not one of usurping the States or taking away from them prerogatives that they wanted, but in reinforcing the States' desire to punish and prosecute crime with the resources of the Federal Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="3301.084" offset="13352184">If there's some agreement among State law enforcement officers and the Federal Government, the Federal Government can do whatever it wants, that doesn't make it any the less obnoxious with regard to the citizens of that State.</text>

            <text syncTime="3314.126" offset="13404324">I think under anybody's view of Commerce Clause authority, Justice Scalia, there is a substantial ability of the Federal Government to regulate what would have been viewed in 1789 as local criminal activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.653" offset="13462525">If an individual uses a telephone to make a threat to destroy a residence by fire because of some personal, private debt, wholly intrastate, that is clearly and indisputably covered under the Federal arson statute because he has used an instrumentality of interstate commerce, the telephone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.629" offset="13534414">Now, these jurisdictional links are not artificial in the sense that they are neither genuine, specific, or concrete.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.689" offset="13562626">They are all of those things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.142" offset="13568478">But they do clearly allow the Federal Government and the States to exercise overlapping jurisdiction on a wide range of crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.310" offset="13597108">And that will be true whether this Court resolves this case against the Government or in favor of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.870" offset="13619364">Now, what I think that the Court should do is recognize that when Congress has put a jurisdictional element in it like this one and the Government can satisfy it both linguistically, practically, and economically, that the Federal authority to prosecute should be upheld.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="3383.958" offset="13683730">Thank you, Mr. Dreeben.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.019" offset="13691985">Mr. Falk, you have 3 minutes remaining.</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald M. Falk</label>
            <text syncTime="3388.097" offset="13700240">There are deep and significant concerns about our Federal system that are posed by this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.139" offset="13752380">They are not solved by the fact that the State authorities asked the Federal authorities to participate because we are talking about what kind of power may be exercised and how.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.852" offset="13795221">The Federal authorities under the Spending Clause certainly could have assisted the States in the investigation of this crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.102" offset="13816223">There was, of course, an eye witness who knew the... the perpetrator, but that... that could be done under the Spending Clause, and I don't think there would be any real serious debate that the Federal authorities could not assist in these investigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.784" offset="13858960">But when it is asserted that the Federal Government has power to protect property, not instrumentalities or items in interstate commerce, but all property, based on a conception that was developed for ways of regulating ways of doing business that have intermingled effects on interstate commerce, and then it is justified because there is a jurisdictional element, which serves as a sort of logic puzzle that if the Federal Government and the prosecutors can figure out a way to get past a compliant lower court, it's just a way of putting the pieces together on everything in the most basic State crime... areas of the State crime and the State power come under Federal power, then it's okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.222" offset="14016739">These I think raise significant problems that don't need to be addressed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.048" offset="14032099">Under Russell, even under Russell, which I think gives us a good working starting place in this... on this... on this issue, the statutory issue... Russell, by the way, Justice Breyer, when the early sentence says that Mr. Russell did earn rental income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.324" offset="14093121">So, in fact, the... the it's not clear whether he earned at that minute, but the building was... had been actually rented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.633" offset="14118408">It was not merely on the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.227" offset="14124782">But this Court said, yes, there's this legislative history that suggests they're going all the way, but it also says substantially all business property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.771" offset="14154979">And in any event, let's look at the words of the statute and what do those mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.113" offset="14172324">And here the Court has to look at the words first.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.815" offset="14187162">The Government says that this business purposes amendment means that Congress meant to cover everything.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.499" offset="14209836">Well, one thing it could not have meant to get by drafting that language is the sort of idea that the mortgage company is using the house, because if the mortgage company or the insurer or the utility company or any of those people are using structures, then they are certainly using them for business purposes, and there would have been absolutely no need to draft this... draft this language at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.180" offset="14284546">It would have been already covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.352" offset="14289249">Everything would have been covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.601" offset="14294264">It makes no sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.617" offset="14298339">Instead, the... the people on... on whom... the members on whom the Government relies kept coming back saying, let's find a way to get residences, and others are saying, well, it's constitutionally doubtful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.769" offset="14338986">And Representative Hungate proposes at the last minute, here's another way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.238" offset="14352778">It's constitutionally doubtful in a different way because of the presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.611" offset="14362287">But it will get residences.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.861" offset="14367302">It will get the... it will get these within the scope of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.782" offset="14379005">And Congress said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.314" offset="14381095">Congress chose these words not because it was going... trying to exercise the absolute, utmost possibility of the commerce power, but because it thought if we choose this... these words carefully, if we structure this statute carefully, we will exercise as much of the power as we can get but stay within constitutional limits. And those limits do not reach this case. It... it... thank you.</text>
