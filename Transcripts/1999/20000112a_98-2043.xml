            <text syncTime="35.377" offset="276209">This case involves a constitutional challenge to two mechanisms that California employs to deny nondomiciliary corporations, like petitioner here, an otherwise allowable interest expense deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.127" offset="347158">Each of these mechanisms provides an independent basis for invalidating the application of California statute to petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.696" offset="389476">First, as respondent has stipulated, California denied petitioner an interest expense deduction entirely because it received nontaxable dividends from nonunitary subsidiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.185" offset="447468">Second, California denied petitioner an interest deduction because those dividends were paid by subsidiaries that did no business in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.619" offset="493130">It is worth stressing at the outset, Your Honors, that the second mechanism is indistinguishable from the taxing scheme that this Court struck down in Fulton Corporation v. Faulkner.</text>

            <label>Mr. Walter Hellerstein</label>
            <text syncTime="3224.353" offset="13032114">I have three very brief points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.586" offset="13056983">First, with regard to the CFC netting rule that both Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg referred to, you're quite right, Justice Breyer, the CFC netting rule is, in fact, a very finely tuned tracing rule, as Justice Scalia said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.093" offset="13115079">It only arises in a situation when there's... you go to some unrelated lender, you borrow money, you then relend that money to your controlled foreign corporation, the controlled foreign corporation then pays you interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.624" offset="13165130">That's the situation we're talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.360" offset="13172131">If California had anything like that, we certainly wouldn't be here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.082" offset="13182998">Again, a finely tuned mechanism addressed to a specific tax evasion problem which actually doesn't even... it just reduces the foreign tax credit, is what we're talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.370" offset="13220196">It's not even a... it's not a jurisdictional problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.682" offset="13229391">Point two, Mr. Lew suggested, gee, these... all these other formulas that we're suggesting are reasonable are vulnerable to the same sort of criticism that we're making, and that's not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.995" offset="13274635">The criticism that we're making is that the California formula disproportionately assigns interest expense to nontaxable income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.744" offset="13309639">All of those other formulas do it on an even-handed, nondiscriminatory basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.914" offset="13326358">And finally, his suggestion that, because the statute is internally consistent it is therefore constitutional, is a non sequitur.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.178" offset="13355406">It would be... if California had a statute that assigned income based on the number of square miles in a State, that would be internally consistent, but I think would plainly be unconstitutional and, indeed, in cases involving retaliatory taxes, which are entirely consistent, this Court has also held they are unconstitutional.</text>
