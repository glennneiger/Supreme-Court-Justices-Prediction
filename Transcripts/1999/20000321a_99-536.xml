            <text syncTime="169.977" offset="828071">One is whether the prima facie proof of age discrimination, coupled with evidence sufficient to support a finding that the employee was not offered a true reason for an adverse employment action, is sufficient to sustain a jury verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.856" offset="879584">Then the second one is whether on passing from... passing on a motion for judgment of law under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50, the court can consider all the evidence or just the evidence favoring the non moving party.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.814" offset="935486">And then, three, whether the standard for granting summary judgment under rule 50 is the same as that for granting... rather, judgment as a matter of law under rule 50 is the same as summary judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="254.566" offset="1166513">We think the jury was entitled to believe that, but on the other hand, the Fifth Circuit, because they consider all the evidence, they say, oh, no, Ms. Sanderson made the decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="263.763" offset="1203293">Well, then, maybe they applied that standard incorrectly, but if the standard... does it make a whole lot of difference whether it's all the evidence, just the petitioner's evidence, just the plaintiff's evidence, so long as you must draw every inference, you must read every piece of testimony in the light most favorable to the non movant?</text>

            <text syncTime="355.016" offset="1568276">And Your Honor just said in this Weisgram case you talked about 2 weeks ago, where the appeals... court of appeals should be constantly alert to the trial judge's firsthand knowledge of the witnesses, the decision maker's feel for the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1581.161" offset="6472818">Now, we ask why is that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.875" offset="6483685">The purpose of that is in the Improvement Company v. Munson case, cited in the product liability counsel's brief filed in support of respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.061" offset="6532482">That was one of the first cases where the Court held that the mere fact that there may be some evidence that's introduced does not necessarily mean that the quantum is there to warrant the jury determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.469" offset="6582115">And the Court held there in Improvement Company v. Munson that it was the function... there was a preliminary question for the judge to determine whether or not, under the substantive law involved, there was sufficient evidence to warrant a jury determination.</text>

Bessemer City, actually cited by petitioner in his brief on another point, is very determinative of the fact because there, in that case, the Court held that in determining, under the sufficiency of the evidence, that there were certain general principles which must be reviewed and which Your Honors stated derived from our cases, one being--</text>

            <text syncTime="1910.049" offset="7788449">Your Honor, let us now review and revisit, if you will, the respondent's interpretation of the teachings of this Court in Hicks and Hazen Paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.013" offset="7836306">Initially, to back up before Hicks and revisit Hazen, we know that the court there stated quite clearly that with respect to age discrimination, there's no disparate treatment if the reason is a factor other than age.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.303" offset="7897432">These are some general principles I think it important to revisit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.516" offset="7910284">In Hazen, we also discussed the fact that there the mere fact that an employer maybe violated ERISA and/or, I think in the opinion of the Court, may have... may have violated in... in another instance in an hypothetical title VII with respect to race was not evidence or an indication that age was the deciding factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.215" offset="8029089">With that, I think we have to go forward then to Hicks and initially remember what were the general principles, as I read Hicks, to stand for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.663" offset="8082902">Number one, that no court may substitute for the required finding of the particular discrimination in issue here, age, the much lesser and different standard of simply disbelief of the employer's reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.988" offset="8168165">The Court time and time again in Hicks stated that there must be evidence both that the employer's reason was untrue and that age or... in this case age was the motivation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2020.869" offset="8231695">But then doesn't Hicks also say... and indeed, doesn't the Fifth Circuit say in other cases... that ordinarily what you have is the prima facie case?</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.354" offset="8265654">And in addition, you know one other thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.577" offset="8274536">The lawyer wasn't telling... the employer wasn't telling the truth when he gave his reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.481" offset="8298151">Now, what I thought Hicks said and what I thought that Reeves said is, well, in the Fifth... Rhodes I guess... in the Fifth Circuit, is in... in most cases, that's the end of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.807" offset="8339424">Of course, the jury could... could infer from those two things that there was discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.791" offset="8359382">Now, we concede there's a weird case, really weird.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.101" offset="8372652">It was a pretext.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.563" offset="8378503">But it was a pretext because the employer was an embezzler and he had been found out by the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.436" offset="8397938">And I grant you in such a case it is a pretext, but not for discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.639" offset="8414761">So, that's why there's always this qualification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.512" offset="8426255">But you have a case where the Fifth Circuit said, one, there's a prima facie case; two, the jury could... may well have found a pretext; but three, it couldn't come to the conclusion of discrimination, at which point one wants to shout why?</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.195" offset="8500965">Why not?</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.103" offset="8504622">I mean, after all, your employer client was not an embezzler.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.617" offset="8522699">There's no evidence here that it's a weird case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.119" offset="8532730">So... so, therefore, I thought perhaps this decision of the Fifth Circuit, though not Rhodes, is inconsistent with Hicks, with Rhodes, and with a lot of other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.886" offset="8575780">And that's what the SG says.</text>

            <text syncTime="2109.470" offset="8586124">Justice Breyer, I think first we must visit the decision of the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.735" offset="8615173">The Fifth Circuit made a... a statement, Reeves may well be correct on this, something of that nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.839" offset="8643594">But still, there's no evidence of... of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.460" offset="8654043">Now, what was the Fifth Circuit talking about when they... when they made that statement?</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.263" offset="8677240">About two or three sentences before that statement in their opinion, the Fifth Circuit said Reeves alleges there's pretext because, number one, I attempted to be careful in my record keeping.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.094" offset="8732619">Number two, well, these errors were made by my boss, Russell Caldwell.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.308" offset="8757488">And three, Sanderson could not really quantify the amount of money that may have been lost on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.563" offset="8790507">I submit that's what the Fifth Circuit said the evidence of pretext was, and I think consistent with Rhodes v. Guiberson, the Eighth Circuit's decision, the Second Circuit in Fisher v. Vassar College, the numerous other circuits, the Eighth Circuit decision in Rothmeier v. Individual Investors, that the Fifth Circuit was stating and complying with what Your Honors said in Hicks when you stated there may be instances... I paraphrase, of course... when the prima facie case, when... and coupled with evidence of disbelief of the employer's reason, especially if accompanied by mendacity, may... may be sufficient without more.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.529" offset="9014324">What I envision Hicks is saying there and what the... I think the Fifth Circuit in Rhodes, the Eighth Circuit, the Sixth... not the Sixth... the Fourth Circuit and the Second read that to mean is it depends what is the prima facie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.761" offset="9087258">We know, as set forth by Your Honors in Hicks, and as the Second Circuit Fisher case had a good, I think, discussion in a footnote, that there were over 100 cases at quick blush--</text>

            <text syncTime="2258.761" offset="9183284">I mean, if they had said there wasn't enough evidence of pretext.</text>

            <text syncTime="2263.232" offset="9201151">What they said is a reasonable jury could have found that Sanderson's explanation for its employment decision was pretextual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.370" offset="9233648">Reeves on this point very well may be right.</text>

            <text syncTime="2323.332" offset="9441582">If... if... I beg the Court to... to bear with me a second.</text>

            <text syncTime="2351.502" offset="9554222">If the prima facie case comes out in that skeletal form only, the one two three four test at McDonnell Douglas, and if after the defendant articulates a non age reason, the plaintiff then only... only introduces evidence where that's not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.824" offset="9639486">Mr. Sanderson Plumbing, you didn't quantify the amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.968" offset="9656100">Mr. Reeves said that his boss made those errors even though his boss was terminated too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.752" offset="9679192">If that's all that's present, I submit that Hicks says that is not enough because that does not show any evidence of age discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.189" offset="9728929">On the other hand, if the petitioner's prima facie case does more, reaches out and gathers more than the... than the skeletal one, two, three, four of McDonnell Douglas, then coupled with evidence of disbelief of the employer's reason, there may be a jury question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.853" offset="9811581">Here, as I was going to say earlier, point three delves into that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.208" offset="9833001">What... what was the... the petitioner's prima facie case first?</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.731" offset="9859124">They stated Mr. Reeves was over 40, contention that he was doing his job satisfactory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.197" offset="9896949">At this stage we don't worry too much whether that was... the prima facie was made or not because Your Honors have held in Aikens at this point it doesn't matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.563" offset="9926415">But in any... and he was terminated and that he was replaced by a younger person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.416" offset="9945850">Now, this evidence also was undisputed that these younger people who replaced petitioner, in their 30's, were also terminated at a later date.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.633" offset="9990781">Also, the evidence showed that Mr. Caldwell, who was also terminated, was replaced by an older person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.408" offset="10017844">So, we have that flimsy, weak, mechanical procedural prima facie case only.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.694" offset="10046996">What else did... did the petitioner submit?</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.776" offset="10059326">Mr. Chestnut made two, as the petitioner says, age related statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.029" offset="10088374">What were they?</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.731" offset="10095166">One, supposedly, you must have come over on the Mayflower.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.842" offset="10111571">Some... more... more than 2 months before the termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.136" offset="10128707">He was unable to quantify it, but much more than 2 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.928" offset="10139888">The second, when Mr. Reeves was working on a piece of machinery, Mr. Chestnut supposedly said, because he couldn't get the machine going, you're too damned old to do that job.</text>

            <text syncTime="3155.190" offset="12768956">In fact, Mr. Caldwell is the one who caught it on the monthly report and corrected it and after Mr. Reeves had reviewed the weekly reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.384" offset="12801765">There... there are many things that Mr. Reeves has stated, based on his surmise and suspicion, but it's... it's... in all deference, Your Honors, it's not evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.355" offset="12857667">It's... it's his dislike of the reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.706" offset="12867071">I don't think I should have been terminated, or maybe Sanderson made a mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.709" offset="12887029">Well, we know that a mistake does not equate under decisions from every circuit to age discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.725" offset="12923078">So, I submit, as I was finishing, in the one two three standard in Manzer, the pretext... I use the word pretext on it, and it's not a good term to use... circuit... that under that standard, if we adopt that standard that the petitioner wants us to use today, there is no evidence of a jury question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.568" offset="13006461">There were two other people who were either terminated or would be terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.212" offset="13029031">There were two other people... think about this... independent of Mr. Chestnut who independently reviewed these records and made the recommendations to the... to the president that Mr. Reeves be terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.601" offset="13086604">There is no inference, no suspicion that these two were in any way connected with these two statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.178" offset="13116907">So, I guess I get back, Your Honors, to the very beginning of my argument when I stated that when you boil all of the evidence together... that's not a good way to say it, but I think that's one way to study the sufficiency of the evidence... that under the standard I think is correct, there is no evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="3273.116" offset="13240622">The jury hears the witnesses one by one over a 4-day trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.220" offset="13257132">Mr. Smith comes in and tries to tell this Court, which is accepted in the court of appeals, what the facts were in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.334" offset="13281582">There's no way to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.622" offset="13286702">There's no way that a court of appeals can understand the facts of the case the way a jury can when it's heard the case, heard the witnesses one by one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.339" offset="13317527">I want to point out just a few of the things, Your Honors, that he said are just blatantly wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.410" offset="13333827">It's not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.131" offset="13336753">It's not what the jury found.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.952" offset="13339992">And just the thing is most... that's most striking about this case, when they had the man that made the age statements, Mr. Chestnut, they made this totally fabricated effort to say that he wasn't the man making the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.351" offset="13389625">And we introduced a letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.913" offset="13395894">Here's a letter we put in evidence that the jury had time to sit there and read and digest and consider the significance of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.794" offset="13419404">He writes his boss a letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.296" offset="13425360">Supposed to be his boss.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.568" offset="13430480">And he uses curse words.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.858" offset="13435600">I'm here before the United States Supreme Court so I won't purport to say what he said, but he said when are you going to wake up and learn to do your job.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.953" offset="13464022">That's what he's telling his boss.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.955" offset="13476038">And two people, not just Mr. Reeves, but the young supervisor said he's the absolute power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.858" offset="13495682">You have to please him to keep your job.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.828" offset="13503519">The jury, Your Honor, is entitled to draw the inference that Mr. Chestnut is running the show, that he's in charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.063" offset="13528492">The jury saw them both on a witness stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.066" offset="13536433">She sat up there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.915" offset="13539881">He quotes her at length.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.927" offset="13543956">It is like she had memorized her testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.167" offset="13552838">She's a meek, mild person.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.329" offset="13557540">He gets up there and he's like the tyrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.790" offset="13567362">The jury sees that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.812" offset="13571437">They can understand who's running the show.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.381" offset="13577707">They're in the best position to make that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.883" offset="13587738">They had that... they had that within their discretion to make that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.675" offset="13602889">This business... the first thing he said was, the fact is he answered those questions wrong, Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.381" offset="13629742">If Your Honor... when Your Honor reads the record, you'll see that's not right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.383" offset="13641759">It's not the attorney's testimony as to what... what's in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.983" offset="13656178">It's the jury's decision to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.886" offset="13663702">And the testimony I believe you'll find is uncontradicted to the contrary, that in fact, Mr. Caldwell wrote Mr. Reeves a note and told him to give this lady the credit for these 2 days she was in the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.913" offset="13707901">He acted based on the note that Caldwell told him, and the company knew that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3409.735" offset="13787104">They tell the supervisor, you fire Jones and if you don't fire him, you're fired.</text>

            <text syncTime="3416.730" offset="13815107">That question... we can't just say, well, you... that's just another thing the jury can consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.532" offset="13834333">Mr. Smith can argue that to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.175" offset="13840916">He can say, well, they fired Caldwell, so it must not have been age.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.346" offset="13849589">Caldwell was only 45.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.106" offset="13856590">He can argue that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.628" offset="13862755">Let the jury decide that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.068" offset="13864531">And Judge Senter told the jury... Judge Senter... further, in order for the plaintiff to prevail, he bears the burden... this is on page 7 of the transcript of the jury charge... he bears the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the reasons offered for terminating him were not the true reasons but rather a pretext for age discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.624" offset="13942689">That's what he told them that they had to prove.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.563" offset="13950422">This jury charge is a model.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.905" offset="13955855">Judge Senter's jury charge ought to be given by every district judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.345" offset="13969543">It's a model of what this Court said you have to prove, especially in the St. Mary's case.</text>
