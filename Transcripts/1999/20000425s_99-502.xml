            <text syncTime="10.762" offset="127084">This case presents the question of the process due to a person against to whom a claim is asserted after judgment in the action has issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.022" offset="172224">The question stems from patent litigtion between two corporations; respondent Adams USA and the company called OCP.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.685" offset="210781">Adams prevailed and the Court ordered OCP to pay Adams attorney fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.672" offset="234813">Adams suspected for good reason that OCP might not have the money in its corporate till to pay the fee award, that that was sought payment from the private purse of the President and sole shareholder of OCP, petitioner Nelson.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.267" offset="301164">To that end, Adams moved to amend its pleading to add Nelson as a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.129" offset="324570">Adams also moved to alter the judgment to subject Nelson to personal liability for the fee award.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.661" offset="354768">The istrict Court granted both requests simultaneously thus making Nelson a party and subjecting him to judgment at a single stroke.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.287" offset="397190">A divided panel of the Federal Circuit correctly noted that it was uncommon to add a party after the entry of judgment and then subject that party to immediate liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.111" offset="444524">But the panel nontheless affirmed saying that Nelson was not prejudiced by the unusual time and manner in which he was named the party.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.083" offset="480469">In the Federal Circuit’s view nothing different would have been done to stay off the fee award, had Nelson been named as a party in his personal capacity earlier in the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.557" offset="530310">In an opinion filed today we reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.626" offset="542640">Due process of law and the requirements of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure specially Rule 15 governing pleading amendments, chart our course.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.260" offset="585168">They demand that a party joined in litigation have a fair opportunity to air its side of the story after it is made a party and before judgment is entered against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.250" offset="633128">A court’s forecast that a party would be unsuccessful in a voting liability that any defense he raises would fail does not warrant denial of an actual opportunity to defend.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.203" offset="684851">We express no view on the likelihood that Nelson will ultimately be liable for the award of attorney fees; we hold only that the District Court acted out of bounds when it subjected Nelson to judgment at the very instant it added him as the party to the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.525" offset="754232">The opinion is unanimous.</text>
