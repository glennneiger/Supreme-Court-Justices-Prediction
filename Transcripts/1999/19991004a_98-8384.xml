            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="140972">We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 98-8384, Terry Williams v. John Taylor.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.327" offset="174200">Mr. Gibbons.</text>

            <label>Mr. John J. Gibbons</label>
            <text syncTime="10.749" offset="183917">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.110" offset="201367">I represent the petitioner, Terry Williams, who appeals from a judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversing a United States court district judgment which granted Williams a new sentencing hearing because of ineffective assistance of counsel during the sentencing phase of his trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.664" offset="279525">The petition presents two issues, the first, was Williams prejudiced as that term is defined in Strickland v. Washington, by the undisputed failure of his counsel to investigate and present available and compelling mitigation evidence?</text>
            <text syncTime="56.239" offset="365834">The second is, if Williams was prejudiced by that failure, must an Article III court, including this Court, nevertheless deny habeas corpus relief because section 2254(d)(1) of title 28 compels it to defer to an erroneous legal decision of the Virginia supreme court on the Strickland v. Washington issue?</text>
            <text syncTime="84.028" offset="477011">Williams' position on the first issue is that the experienced State trial judge and the experience district court judge correctly applied the Strickland prejudice standard to the undisputed facts respecting counsel's deficient performance.</text>

            <text syncTime="117.500" offset="610967">The two trial judges got it right.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.832" offset="628208">With respect to the second issue, Williams' position is that section 2254(d)(1), properly interpreted, does not require the entry of a judgment by an Article III court inconsistent with the constitutional law pronounced by this Court simply because a State court entered such a judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.620" offset="743356">The language of section 2254(d)(1) did not, indeed could not constitutionally require this Court to enter a judgment inconsistent with its own view of constitutional law.</text>

            <text syncTime="179.401" offset="858503">Would it be fair to say that if the Fourth Circuit in this case made a reasonable application, say of our decision in Strickland v. Washington, then the... your client would not prevail?</text>

            <text syncTime="265.881" offset="1204469">It... the contrary-to language in 2254(d)(1) seems to me refers to the selection of the wrong legal standard, and as I read the cases that have been decided in the courts of appeals, they all agree that when the State court chooses the wrong legal standard, there's plenary review.</text>

            <text syncTime="3466.074" offset="14005201">Now, that is not... that in itself is not a misapplication of Strickland, is it, to say the circuit court was wrong for adopting a per se approach?</text>

            <text syncTime="3475.251" offset="14041876">Well, if you read that in the context of the trial court's decision, yes, it's wrong, because what the trial court looked at was the fact that the Virginia legislature had opted for a scheme in which the jury must be unanimous before it can impose death.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.096" offset="14129334">What else is that, except the reasonable probability that the jury will not be unanimous, and the court says, that's a per se rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="3528.878" offset="14256394">In other words, I thought they were saying that the mere fact that the result would have been different is not enough under Strickland.</text>
