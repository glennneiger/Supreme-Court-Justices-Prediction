            <text syncTime="9.439" offset="143235">Section 922(g)(9) was enacted to protect battered women and children and to close a dangerous loophole in Federal law that allowed domestic abusers to possess firearms.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.746" offset="188479">That loophole existed because many domestic abusers were only convicted of misdemeanor offenses, and the misdemeanor offenses they were most often convicted of were assault and battery crimes.</text>

            <text syncTime="44.160" offset="282102">That would render the statute a virtual dead letter from the moment of its enactment until today, and it would leave that dangerous loophole wide open.</text>

            <text syncTime="1728.858" offset="7020858">Something that the government really doesn't talk about at all is that the language in this statute is based directly on the language used in ACCA and the language previous to that, which is used in 18 USC Section 16, the generic definition of crime of violence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1872.819" offset="7596701">It's exactly what Congress had in mind here, and I think we do agree with the government on this, that Congress perceived a loophole in the law at the time because the firearm restriction at the time applied only to felons and people who engaged in violent conduct, as Senator Lautenberg, the principal sponsor said, that because of the outdated thinking by prosecutors, people who engaged in violent conduct are to be prosecuted against as a felony, if committed against somebody else, was prosecuted as a misdemeanor because a family member was the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.421" offset="7715192">And so Congress wanted to close that loophole by saying people who engage in this kind of violence against a family member could not escape.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.575" offset="7739747">And so violent misdemeanors were directed -- were defined here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.210" offset="7758347">And -- and as Senator Wellstone very graphically put it, if you beat your neighbor's wife or batter your neighbor's wife, that's a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.816" offset="7784678">If you beat or battery your wife or your child, that's a misdemeanor, and we have to get past that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.085" offset="7797844">So that's what they were trying to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.518" offset="7803486">They were not trying to broaden the category of conduct that was being criminal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2848.419" offset="11499186">The face -- the fact is, I think it is crucial to this case and something the government ignores, that Congress used the language virtually identical to language that it had used in prior statutes like ACCA, adopting the language of ‶ violence ″ as it had done in ACCA, as it did in 18 U.S.C. Section 16 in the definition of -- the generic definition of crime of violence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2931.273" offset="11830523">I will say two things about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.475" offset="11835330">First, in fact, the definition in our statute is a stricter definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.462" offset="11863333">It covers a narrower category of crimes, as I said before, than -- than the ACCA definition does because when we reach threats ACCA addresses -- you know, any threat of use of force, and this statute addresses only a threat of use of a deadly weapon, a much more serious and narrower category.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.840" offset="11936789">So it clear -- it is clear that Congress thought about the definition it was using here; it didn't sort of mindlessly take the definition that appeared in ACCA and in 18 USC section 16 and just kind of plop it in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.648" offset="11980048">It actually thought about it, decided that it wanted to use that definition, and then decided that it wanted to -- type in that definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.933" offset="12001155">So I think for those reasons the government's suggestion that we somehow depart from what the Court said was the definition in Johnson--</text>

            <text syncTime="3004.071" offset="12121736">The Court then did go on to say in response to other arguments by the government that a slap in the face could be a crime of violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.725" offset="12152352">A slap in the face I think is a painful thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.010" offset="12161547">It is not -- it's not a soap in the eyes; it's not a stubbed toe, it's not -- it's not a pinch.</text>

            <text syncTime="3021.081" offset="12189759">And of course the Court will tell us what it meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.366" offset="12198954">But I do not take Johnson to be meaning to define definitively a crime of violence as being anything which causes any de minimis level of pain or injury, which again is not consistent with the word of violence, which is extreme, unusual, very powerful force.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.958" offset="12257259">I guess a couple of other small points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.998" offset="12293413">If the Court were to adopt the government's standard, because the language that is used here is identical in -- in our statute and in ACCA, I think it would have to be a case that whatever the Court says about the nature of the injury that is inflicted that is sufficient to be violent force in this statute applies in the violent felon context as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.495" offset="12375437">I think it would be quite extraordinary to think that, you know, soap in the eyes, which triggers a -- a State battery prosecution would be sufficient to qualify as a violent felony, and -- and make someone subject to a 15-year mandatory Federal prison sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.706" offset="12448267">I mean, that is quite a remarkable outcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.725" offset="12456312">And because Congress did use exactly the same language in -- in these two statutes, that would be the consequence of adopting the government's position here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.264" offset="12490481">That it's not that -- that what they are saying is admitted to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.735" offset="12512423">It's not -- unless one assumes that Congress meant radically different things, using the same language from a closely related statute several years prior -- unless one -- one takes -- then the consequence of the government's reading here washes back into the violent felony definition, and the mandatory 15-year sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.279" offset="12586611">I think that can't possibly be what Congress had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.748" offset="12600404">In response to a point that Ms. Sherry made about the Wachtel decision from the Tennessee courts that we cite, we do not cite that as an example of something that is not violent, not serious crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.706" offset="12648260">We are simply citing it for the standard, the legal standard that Tennessee courts stated for application of their assault statute, and the nature of the level of force that was necessary and the court here said pushing somebody, scratching somebody would be sufficiently to a working crime of -- that inflicts bodily injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.702" offset="12728299">It is not theoretical, I should add, that people are prosecuted for things like this across the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.773" offset="12756512">In our brief and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers briefs cite examples of people who are prosecuted for nonserious crimes, including nonviolent crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.812" offset="12792665">People -- for spitting or pushing people's hands away.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.931" offset="12805204">In Tennessee I can't cite cited cases, reported cases that involve conduct of that type in a domestic context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.037" offset="12837596">I can say that people are arrested in Tennessee with some frequency for domestic assault, in contexts where the allegation is that they pushed, that they spit, that they pushed somebody's arm away.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.827" offset="12888796">So you have to assume that some number of these people are prosecuted and in this case, they plead guilty to make the case go away.</text>

            <label>Ms. Melissa Arbus Sherry</label>
            <text syncTime="3450.210" offset="13906317">I have four points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.530" offset="13927633">Number one, Justice Breyer, you are exactly right and it does mean something different in this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.082" offset="13945814">Justice Kagan, it is a lesser definition of physical force.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.700" offset="13960234">There is -- this is a misdemeanor offense, it's not a felony offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.336" offset="13974758">Common law misdemeanor, understanding of physical force applies directly here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.473" offset="13995343">It's a perfect fit, unlike in Johnson.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.506" offset="14003493">Also this is a fundamentally different statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.592" offset="14011852">This is not ACCA; we're not talking about a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.995" offset="14029406">A consequence in ACCA of saying it's not a violent felony means there's no mandatory minimum, but the individual still cannot possess a gun, and a sentence in court can still take prior convictions into consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.684" offset="14072247">This is a gun prohibition that applies equally to nonviolent felons, to drug addicts, the mentally ill, and other classes of individuals that Congress thought could not be trusted to possess a gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.159" offset="14114147">The second point, we're talking about criminal convictions here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.194" offset="14126268">These are events that are serious enough to require police intervention and to have someone prosecuted to a successful conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.300" offset="14158660">And so if you look through the cases, these are not examples of husbands tapping their wives or giving them a paper cut or stubbing their toe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.971" offset="14189380">These are cases of real domestic abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.238" offset="14198366">And the third point is one of the fatal flaws in Respondent's argument, he acknowledges the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.559" offset="14223653">He acknowledges that Congress was trying to get guns away from violent individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.880" offset="14240998">But these violent individuals who are convicted of misdemeanors are not convicted of misdemeanors in the abstract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.348" offset="14262836">They're actually convicted of violating certain State laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.450" offset="14275271">And the State laws that exist, the State laws that are on the books do not qualify as misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence in his -- under his interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.925" offset="14313201">And the fourth point is I would encourage the Court to look at the State statutes that we do cite in the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.579" offset="14335770">And I would disagree, I do not think they can be broken down in the way that Respondent suggests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.880" offset="14353011">Certainly, in their brief, they don't point to any examples where any of those State statutes would qualify under their definition, which would exclude not only offensive touching, but would also exclude bodily injury cases like the one at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.207" offset="14410272">And we're not talking about just the generic assault and battery laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.925" offset="14425214">In Appendix C and D of our brief, we also cite domestic-specific -- domestic violence laws, domestic assault, and domestic battery laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.515" offset="14455516">And it is quite perverse to think that Congress adopted a statute that was designed to take guns away from domestic abusers and chose to define misdemeanor crime of domestic violence in a way that not only excludes generic assault and battery laws, but also excludes most domestic assault and battery laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.742" offset="14532420">The practical effect here is far worse than in Hayes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.694" offset="14544227">In Hayes, it would have been a dead letter in two-thirds of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.796" offset="14556662">Here we are talking about virtually the entire country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.932" offset="14569201">Maybe a few States survive, but at best, that is all that survives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.752" offset="14592502">The modified categorical approach is no help here with respect to all of those States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.056" offset="14609638">Now, with respect to the offensive touching issue, I just want to -- I don't want to leave the Court with the impression that we're arguing just for bodily injury assault here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.246" offset="14646418">We do not think the Johnson definition applies here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.298" offset="14658644">We think a different definition of physical force should apply, and we think the consequences of adopting the Johnson definition are significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.284" offset="14686647">It's 28 States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3646.053" offset="14689677">It's the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.636" offset="14696051">Maybe they're divisible; maybe they are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.271" offset="14706500">And even if they are, Justice Breyer, you're absolutely correct that if you looked at the State court records in this case -- these cases, in most cases, it is not going to identify the actual crime of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3661.063" offset="14749759">And so in those cases, it is going to be a virtual dead letter, in the same way that it was in Hayes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.698" offset="14772224">In Hayes, it wasn't nationwide; one-third of the States had domestic violence laws on the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.269" offset="14790510">So it's similar to Hayes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.787" offset="14796570">It's similar to Nijhawan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.237" offset="14802422">It's similar to what this Court said in Taylor when it rejected the common law definition of ‶ burglary ″.</text>
            <text syncTime="3679.025" offset="14821543">And the last point is that this Court has a choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.143" offset="14834082">It can either embrace the common law meaning of force and ensure that people who harm those that they are supposed to protect do not have guns, or it can depart from the common law, which it does not normally do, and render 922(g)(9) a virtual dead letter.</text>
