            <text syncTime="14.674" offset="165337">The issue in this case is whether a Michigan constitutional provision requiring equal treatment violates equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.361" offset="196161">And for two reasons, the answer is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.647" offset="205252">First, unlike the laws at issue in Hunter and Seattle, Section 26 does not repeal an antidiscrimination law.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.152" offset="239316">Instead, it repeals preferences and thus, it's an impediment to preferential treatment, not equal treatment.</text>

            <text syncTime="42.858" offset="278081">It had to do with a remedy, defective segregation.</text>

            <text syncTime="50.095" offset="307025">Justice Sotomayor, it's not identical because of the remedy issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.482" offset="324579">In Seattle, they were trying to create, in the court's words, equal educational opportunity by imposing a remedy that would result in equality in the schools.</text>

            <text syncTime="63.087" offset="359061">You don't think that the proponents of affirmative action are attempting to do the same thing?</text>
            <text syncTime="66.555" offset="372854">One of the bill sponsors here said that this constitutional amendment will bring back desegregation in Michigan, and it appears to have done just that.</text>

            <label>Mr. John J. Bursch</label>
            <text syncTime="75.661" offset="409320">Well, there's two points to that question and I'll address them both.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.763" offset="421755">First on the merits, under Grutter, the point of preferences in university admissions cannot be solely the benefit of the minority, because under Grutter, it's supposed to benefit the campus as a whole through diversity, and which we think is a laudable goal.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.772" offset="477761">It's a forward-looking action, not a backward-looking action, to remedy past discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.091" offset="499077">And we know that because under Grutter, you can use preferences whether or not there's de facto or de jure segregation, simply to get the benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.597" offset="529066">But with respect to your -- your point about the University of Michigan and what has or has not happened here, two thoughts on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.318" offset="551949">First, we have the statistics that we discuss in our reply brief where it's not clear that -- that the diversity on Michigan's campus has gone down.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.322" offset="579952">But our main point on that is -- is not those numbers, but the fact that there are other things that the University of Michigan could be doing to achieve diversity in race-neutral ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.710" offset="617464">For example, we know that--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="129.562" stopTime="143.222">
            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="129.562" offset="624883">I thought that in Grutter, all of the social scientists had pointed out to the fact that all of those efforts had failed.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.135" offset="655185">That's one of the reasons why the -- I think it was a law school claim in Michigan was upheld.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_j_bursch" startTime="143.222" stopTime="166.952">
            <label>Mr. John J. Bursch</label>
            <text syncTime="143.222" offset="679531">--Well, there's social science evidence that goes both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.174" offset="691338">But I want to focus on the University of Michigan because there's two things that they could be doing right now that would get them closer to the race-neutral goal.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.111" offset="723103">The first thing is that they could eliminate alumnae preferences.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.146" offset="735224">Other schools have done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.248" offset="739613">They have not.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.931" offset="742434">That's certainly one way that tilts the playing field away from underrepresented minorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.966" offset="758525">The other one, and this is really important, is the focus on socioeconomic--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="166.952" stopTime="180.677">
            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="166.952" offset="774512">It's always wonderful for minorities that they finally get in, they finally have children and now you're going to do away for that preference for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.708" offset="809516">It seems that the game posts keeps changing every few years for minorities.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_j_bursch" startTime="180.677" stopTime="225.973">
            <label>Mr. John J. Bursch</label>
            <text syncTime="180.677" offset="829369">--Given the makeup of Michigan's alumnae right now, certainly that playing field would be tilted the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.665" offset="849327">The other thing that we practice is socioeconomic diversity.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.033" offset="862806">And at the University of Michigan, there was a stat in “ The Wall Street Journal ” just two days ago that if you measure that by Pell grants, the number of students who are eligible for those, at the University, the number of students who have Pell grants is half what it is at more progressive institutions like Berkeley and the University of Texas at Austin.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.495" offset="932605">So the University of Michigan could be trying harder.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.014" offset="942741">But our point isn't to get into a debate about whether preferences are a good or bad thing, because that's not what this case is about.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.018" offset="970744">The question is whether the people of Michigan have the choice through the democratic process to accept this Court's invitation in Grutter to try race-neutral means.</text>

            <text syncTime="227.239" offset="1015570">Well, while you're on Seattle, can you -- I have difficulty distinguishing Seattle.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.127" offset="1035214">One factual difference is that there was a school board there, a directly-elected school board elected for a short term of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.768" offset="1081712">Here there's a board of trustees.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.468" offset="1088504">Is that -- is that the distinguish -- a distinguishing factor in the case in which a principal distinction could be made?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_j_bursch" startTime="251.355" stopTime="351.485">
            <label>Mr. John J. Bursch</label>
            <text syncTime="251.355" offset="1112119">I think it's a distinguishing factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.307" offset="1119851">You know, kind of sticking with how hard is it under the new political process.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.025" offset="1134793">And I think the chart that we have on page 17 of our reply brief explains that it's really easier to change race-based admissions policies now than it was before Section 26.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.065" offset="1174917">And that's one basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.798" offset="1177843">But I think the more fundamental basis is to say, you know, what Seattle is about.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.952" offset="1198427">And -- and if you indulge me, I'm going to suggest that Seattle could mean one of three things.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.605" offset="1221102">One of those I think you should clearly reject, and then the other two I think are -- are possible interpretations that you could adopt.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.942" offset="1246388">When Seattle talks about racial classifications, it focuses on laws that have a racial focus.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.446" offset="1272406">Now, right out of the box, equal protection is about people, not about laws, but even more fundamentally, that cannot be the right test.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.002" offset="1298633">At a minimum, that part of Seattle has to go because if you had a race-neutral law, like Michigan's Equal Protection Clause, which forbids discrimination on the basis of race or sex -- you know, it mirrors the concept of the Federal clause -- that itself would be subject to strict scrutiny because it has a racial focus.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.696" offset="1361431">So we know that can't be right and that's Respondent's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.396" offset="1372298">So that leaves you two other choices.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.081" offset="1378986">And one would be an incremental change to this political restructuring doctrine; the other would be a more aggressive change.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.585" offset="1405004">The incremental change would be to interpret racial classification in Seattle as meaning a law that, one, repeals an antidiscrimination provision, as it did in Hunter and Seattle; and two, removes that issue to a higher level of the decision-making process.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.177" offset="1463414">And because Michigan's law requires equal treatment, it eliminates preferences, not an antidiscrimination law.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.998" offset="1486610">That would be a way that you could keep Seattle and Hunter as a viable doctrine, and still rule in our favor on this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="351.485" offset="1512628">I don't see the distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.102" offset="1515031">Bussing could be viewed, and was viewed, to benefit only one group.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.306" offset="1535929">It was a preference for blacks to get into better schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.774" offset="1553797">That's the way the case was pitched, that was its justification, and to integrate the society.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.945" offset="1578457">Affirmative action has the same gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.830" offset="1594026">We've said that in Fisher; it should be to diversify the population, so it favors diversity as opposed to desegregation.</text>

            <text syncTime="380.919" offset="1630388">But there's a difference between favoring diversity as an abstract concept on campus, which Grutter clearly allows, and remedying past discrimination, which was the point of the bussing in Seattle.</text>

            <text syncTime="470.406" offset="1988266">And if you did that, you could reconcile those cases with Washington v. Davis and the entire line of equal protection jurisprudence this Court has used since that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="766.162" offset="3171299">And what we find is that the number of underrepresented minorities as part of the entering freshman class at Michigan as a percentage changed very little.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.949" offset="3202437">It went from about 10-3/4 percent to about 10-1/4 percent.</text>

            <text syncTime="794.681" offset="3285402">And Justice Sotomayor, when you see in the amici briefs that there has been a dramatic drop, for example, in African American students on campus at the University of Michigan, those numbers don't take into account that people who before were forced to check a single box now could be checking multiple boxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.191" offset="3347469">And if you fold in the multiple checkbox students, the number of underrepresented minorities on campus actually comes out higher.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.961" offset="3378502">Now, we don't know what those numbers are, because you could have a student who might be white and Asian and they would not be considered an underrepresented minority, and they could be in there; but we know that the numbers are a lot closer than when you just look at single checkbox students in isolation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1143.425" offset="4680341">But what we're saying is under Grutter, race preferences are barely permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.763" offset="4705732">It cannot be unconstitutional for the people to choose not to use them anymore, to accept this Court's invitation in Grutter, to move past the discussion about race and into a race-neutral future.</text>

            <text syncTime="1174.394" offset="4804266">Well, under what we're going to call the narrow “ Save Hunter and Seattle ”, something like that would be unconstitutional because it removes an antidiscrimination provision and moves it to a higher level of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.573" offset="4868945">Now, one of the problems with keeping that doctrine is it could also work the opposite way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.041" offset="4886813">You know, pretend that the political climate in Michigan was turned on its head and that universities had agreed that they were no longer going to use race or sex in admissions and that it was the State electorate, either in the legislature or in the constitution, which imposed a Grutter plan on everyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.651" offset="4949298">Well, under Hunter and Seattle, that would have to go because that law removes an antidiscrimination provision and moves it to the higher level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.407" offset="4980331">And so that would be one reason why you might want to take the Washington v. Davis approach and consider whether there's discriminatory animus based on race.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.596" offset="5013036">But, you know, in either of those cases, I think you can either, you know, pare down the doctrine or get rid of it entirely and distinguish our case from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.534" offset="5048772">But the one point that I want to leave you with today is that the -- the core of Respondent's arguments that somehow a racial classification can be any law that has a racial focus, cannot be the right test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.076" offset="5094956">No matter what, that portion of Seattle and Hunter has to go, because equal protection is about protecting individuals, not about protecting laws; and even nondiscriminatory race-neutral laws that have a racial focus would fall under their racial focus test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.452" offset="5160471">You know, the hypothetical we give in our briefs on that, besides a State Equal Protection Clause, would be the Federal Fair Housing Act because it references race, it has a racial focus, in the words of Seattle and Hunter, and it has the ability of preventing anyone from lobbying for preferences based on their race or sex at lower levels of the government, either State or local.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.182" offset="5243436">So under their theory, the Federal Fair Housing Act would have to be applied under strict scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.753" offset="5265693">And their only response to that in the brief is that: Well, the Supremacy Clause takes care of that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.973" offset="5286591">And we all know supremacy doesn't kick in until you first determine that the Federal law itself is constitutional, and it wouldn't be under their theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.827" offset="5317938">So -- so what we're asking you to do is eliminate that portion of Hunter and Seattle that suggests that a law's racial focus is the sine qua non of a political restructuring doctrine test and to either--</text>

            <text syncTime="1329.611" offset="5425144">I mean, strict scrutiny was originally put forward as a protection for minorities -- a protection for minorities against hostile disadvantageous legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.305" offset="5491913">And so the view then was we use strict scrutiny when the majority is disadvantaging the minority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.178" offset="5535381">So you do, under the Carolene Products view, you do focus on race and you ask, is the minority being disadvantaged?</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.652" offset="5585222">If that were the view, then I suppose we would not be looking at this, well, the criterion is race and wherever the disadvantage falls, whether a majority or minority, it's just the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.634" offset="5685219">That wasn't the original idea of when strict scrutiny is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.438" offset="5704445">So if we were faithful to that notion, that it is -- measures a disadvantage the -- the minority that get strict scrutiny.</text>

            <text syncTime="1411.496" offset="5752615">Well, two thoughts on that, Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.781" offset="5761810">First, under Grutter, this Court made crystal clear that a Grutter plan is not about which minority group is being advantaged or disadvantaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.120" offset="5795142">It's supposed to benefit the campus as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.103" offset="5803084">And to the extent the claim is that preferences benefit certain classes of minorities and not others, you know, for example, it benefits African Americans and Latinos, but not Asians, even though they're both discrete and insular underrepresented groups, that -- then it fails under Grutter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.879" offset="5870166">It can only be something that benefits everybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.831" offset="5878003">But more fundamentally, going back to your question about the origin of the doctrine, I think it's really important to understand why we have Hunter, because Hunter, remember, was decided before Washington v. Davis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.873" offset="5922202">And when you look at the face of the law in Akron, Ohio in Hunter, there's nothing in there that would trigger strict scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.127" offset="5951146">And so this Court was searching for another way to -- to strike down a law that removed an antidiscrimination provision and made it more difficult to reenact at the higher level of the political process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.834" offset="5993987">It needed something to fix that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.084" offset="5999002">And our point is you can either construe it to do exactly that, that only antidiscrimination laws being struck down and moved to a higher level can satisfy a political restructuring doctrine, or you can look at it differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.075" offset="6050934">You can say: Now that we've got Washington v. Davis and we all know what the intent was in Akron, that that is a simpler way to address this -- this problem and we really don't need the political restructuring doctrine at all anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.615" offset="6097118">But the reason why we had the doctrine in Hunter is because strict scrutiny did not apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="1563.189" offset="6359387">Both issues -- both cases involve constitutionally permissible plans which had as their objective obtaining diversity on campuses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.145" offset="6399198">Seattle was a K through 12 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.147" offset="6407244">This case is a higher education case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.616" offset="6417170">But in both instances, the objective was to obtain diversity.</text>
