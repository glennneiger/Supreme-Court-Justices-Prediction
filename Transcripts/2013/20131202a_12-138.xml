            <text syncTime="72.646" offset="397070">So if the issue is what did the parties -- as I see it -- what did the parties intend on this question, why isn't the first options Howsam divide the one that we should follow in this setting?</text>
            <text syncTime="90.324" offset="467809">The Solicitor General is suggesting that we shouldn't follow that.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.545" offset="484737">We should give some sort of heightened deference to the foreign state, but I'm not sure why, because the issue is always about what did the parties intend.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.500" offset="524547">And if the issue is always about that, don't we look at the text?</text>
            <text syncTime="109.654" offset="545132">The custom and practice of the industry?</text>
            <text syncTime="112.839" offset="557879">The behavior between the parties?</text>
            <text syncTime="116.308" offset="571777">Don't we look at all of the factors we normally look at in deciding whether something goes to a substantive or procedural issue?</text>

            <text syncTime="128.433" offset="620260">So it's not that we hold absolutely that in every situation a precondition is subject to an arbitral decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.472" offset="656413">We look to those -- to the issue of consent, don't we?</text>

            <text syncTime="143.642" offset="681073">You do -- you have held in Howsam that if there is a precondition to arbitration, it is presumptively decided by the arbitrators rather than the courts, so that--</text>

            <text syncTime="152.314" offset="715764">Maybe that's why the government is saying we shouldn't treat it as a presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.783" offset="729661">We should just treat it as--</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas Goldstein</label>

            <text syncTime="158.202" offset="739378">Maybe I can help by locating the parties' different arguments in this case because there are a lot of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.522" offset="756619">We have said, of course, that we think you should decide the question presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.890" offset="770098">Argentina wants you to go beyond the question presented, we can talk about whether that's appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.876" offset="786085">If you did decide the question of consent, I think you would do it in a three-part opinion and some of the parts are contested and some aren't.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.865" offset="817955">This is how I would write the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.348" offset="823910">Part one would say look at our decision in Howsam and it's undisputed here that if this was an ordinary contract case, just between two American companies, then BG Group would win because this looks just like a procedural precondition.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.724" offset="881484">It's like the John Wiley staged grievance procedure, and I don't think the other side argues against that.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.128" offset="903009">Then the other side has given you two different arguments for why you wouldn't apply Howsam and why you might have a different analytical framework.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.715" offset="933416">The first argument, we could call it part 2 of the opinion, is the argument of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.103" offset="954941">And what the United States says is look, the difference between this and Howsam is it's an international case.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.857" offset="977928">And what's different in international cases is that when you dealt with Howsam, you dealt with a set of expectations between parties agreeing to arbitrate that may not apply in the international context and so maybe it's different.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.830" offset="1025889">Now, this -- and the reason they say that it's different is that an international case, when it's cited in the United States, is governed by the New York Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.170" offset="1059221">And in a New York Convention case, whether it's a commercial case, whether it's an international treaty arbitration case, what the rule of judicial review is, and that's what we're looking at here, do the arbitrators finally decide the question or does a court on judicial review decide it?</text>
            <text syncTime="253.280" offset="1119617">In a New York Convention case, you look to the law of the citeus.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.834" offset="1137902">Here, the United States, the Federal Arbitration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.852" offset="1149919">So I take the Solicitor General's position to be this: Look, when you have Argentina arbitrating against a company from the United Kingdom, then the Argentine company and -- excuse me -- Argentina and the UK Company don't have any ex-ante understanding about whether the dispute will be finally resolved by a court or instead the arbitrators because who knows where the arbitration would occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.949" offset="1234346">Here it occurred in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.449" offset="1240302">Our answer is that this objection answers itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.919" offset="1254199">It's true that they don't have a specific judicial system, that it will be ahead of time when they sign the treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.673" offset="1281262">Argentina signs a treaty with the United Kingdom.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.609" offset="1288995">They don't know whether a dispute over this precondition will be resolved de novo or instead, it will be resolved deferentially because they don't know where the arbitration will occur, but they do know that the applicable law will be the citeus of the arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.201" offset="1347300">And there is precedent on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.918" offset="1354196">The government's argument here is about international arbitration governed by the New York Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.788" offset="1373736">There are 149 signatories to the New York Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.240" offset="1387528">There have been thousands of challenges to arbitral awards under the New York Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.394" offset="1408113">And we are unaware of any precedent from any country ever that says we are going to not apply our domestic system set of rules, here the Howsam first options lines, because this is an international case.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.552" offset="1460776">We know that--</text>

            <text syncTime="338.902" offset="1462134">I'm not sure that this argument helps you, but it's your argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.206" offset="1487316">But this arbitration took place in the United States because the parties agreed that's where it would take place, right?</text>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="350.610" offset="1508946">So your -- your argument is that by agreeing that the arbitration would take place in the United States, they bought into U.S. arbitration law, no international modification?</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas Goldstein</label>
            <text syncTime="360.981" offset="1550428">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.765" offset="1553563">And that is what has been true in every New York Convention case ever decided in the United States and so far as we are aware, every case decided by every New York Convention signatory because they have -- they are accepting a body of rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.223" offset="1599434">When you were trying to confirm or overturn the award, they agreed to put it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.675" offset="1613226">That's how it--</text>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="377.110" offset="1615003">See, I would have thought that there would -- there'd be an argument for saying that the first options principle shouldn't apply to international -- or to a bilateral investment treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.216" offset="1655440">The whole point of these treaties, as I understand it, is to take these disputes out of the courts because of distrust, at least of the courts of the country against which the claim is asserted, and -- and put it in an international tribunal where some sort of standard international principles would apply, but that's -- you don't like the idea.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas Goldstein</label>
            <text syncTime="406.612" offset="1732972">--No, that's part 3 of the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.646" offset="1737151">I just haven't gotten there.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.729" offset="1741435">Here's the reason why, and that is, the government's argument about the New York Convention doesn't have anything to do with investment treaties.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.966" offset="1766408">It's about the New York Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.402" offset="1772155">And so it applies a company from Japan, chooses a company from Ecuador, and they arbitrate in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.139" offset="1795143">So the government's position has very wide-ranging consequences for any international arbitration in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.376" offset="1820012">Now, Argentina does make the argument that you've described, and this is the next part of the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.364" offset="1844044">If we got past the government's position, which I don't think has any precedent for having a special international rule, we come to Argentina's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.783" offset="1873719">And Argentina says this: Look, the reason this isn't Howsam is that this is a unilateral contract, effectively, and that is, we put our treaty out there and now BG Group has to do something in order to create an arbitration agreement in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.062" offset="1938817">Because we don't have an arbitration agreement with them, we have a consented arbitration, then because of that, call it a precondition, call it whatever you want, because an arbitration agreement hasn't formed, the arbitrators have no power to decide anything and, therefore, you can't defer to their judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.024" offset="2006630">We would never expect them to have the power to decide anything Argentina says because there's no arbitration agreement at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.594" offset="2032962">So that's the next part of the opinion, and it will get to the points you raised, Justice Alito.</text>

            <text syncTime="498.720" offset="2101403">There is a principle of latches, but there is an equivalent principle of equitable tolling.</text>

            <text syncTime="506.743" offset="2133481">I do think ultimately, it's a point in our favor because it shows how pointless this exercise is.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.412" offset="2156155">We'll recall, of course, that while we could leave -- we could file a claim in the Argentine courts, the Argentine courts, of course, would have the power to do nothing at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.667" offset="2189174">They couldn't bind us.</text>

            <text syncTime="522.985" offset="2198474">They wouldn't have to decide the case in the first place and then we would be back here.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.823" offset="2217804">And the question is, if you have a provision like that, which is effectively go wait in the Argentine courts, does anybody seriously think that that determines your consent to arbitrate, when it is that that act, going and sitting, can't have any effect on the case whatsoever.</text>

            <text syncTime="639.259" offset="2663558">Remember, the question presented that you granted certiorari on to resolve a very distinct circuit conflict at the urging of the arbitration community was: What do we do if we have an arbitration agreement and this is a precondition to arbitration?</text>

            <text syncTime="843.504" offset="3480564">Justice Ginsburg, the answer to your question is yes, and I will explain how that plays out under the treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.991" offset="3502506">So this is the agreement that Argentina made with the United Kingdom, and the dispute resolution starts at Page 8A, it's Article VIII.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.346" offset="3535943">Now, there are three conditions in this agreement on Argentina's consent to arbitrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.184" offset="3567290">It does have to agree and we had to do something.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.886" offset="3578052">We had to invest.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.486" offset="3580456">And those three conditions are set out in the first sentence of the dispute resolution provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.471" offset="3600413">It says, and I am now on Article VIII, Roman I:</text>
            <text syncTime="877.508" offset="3616609">"Disputes with regard to an investment. "</text>
            <text syncTime="880.544" offset="3628730">so this arbitration provision is only going to apply to an investment, which is a defined term under the treaty,</text>
            <text syncTime="885.764" offset="3649628">"which arises within the terms of the agreement. "</text>
            <text syncTime="888.549" offset="3660704">So it has to be a treaty claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.482" offset="3668436">"Between an investor of one contracting party and the other contracting party. "</text>
            <text syncTime="895.719" offset="3689439">So that is it has to be a U.K. investor suing an -- seeking to arbitrate against an Argentine company.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.890" offset="3718069">And those are -- if those things aren't true, there is no arbitration agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.111" offset="3734996">Now, that, that language I just read to you is from the local litigation provision and then the treaty says the exact same body of disputes are eligible substantively for arbitration.</text>

            <text syncTime="992.949" offset="4078350">But this provision is wildly different from that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1133.303" offset="4639773">It used to be the case that before these treaties that an investor in BG's position would have to go to the Argentine courts, and when Argentina first created the investment treaties, it kind of liked the idea that you had to spend some time in the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.545" offset="4692750">But no one would agree to the treaty -- this is Justice Alito's question earlier.</text>

            <text syncTime="1160.554" offset="4748756">But it is absolutely critical that we look at the substance of the provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.439" offset="4764325">It's very much, Mr. Chief Justice, like the John Wiley case, which is structured: One, you will have step one of our grievance process; step two, within five days you have to go to our next step of the grievance process; step three, then you can go on to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.499" offset="4816570">It could have stopped, theoretically, at any of those.</text>

            <text syncTime="1183.486" offset="4840498">But the question you are being asked here, if we could just return to if you are trying to decide this de novo or instead defer to the arbitrators' interpretation of whether this litigation provision is binding, is fundamentally when Argentina went into this treaty did it think that the arbitrators were going to resolve the disputes?</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.566" offset="4920851">Right?</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.199" offset="4923359">Did it expect -- it's a question of consent, Justice Sotomayor -- did it expect that the answers to these questions would come from the arbitrators or instead the courts?</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.172" offset="4955228">And when we are talking about the process for getting it going -- Justice Ginsburg talked about the timing, do you have to do this for 18 months, there is another provision here about 3 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.778" offset="4993680">The natural understanding is that there is an arbitration agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.980" offset="5006428">Argentina knew that it could only get this treaty if there was a guarantee to the investors that they would be able to arbitrate, and so expects the arbitrators to decide this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.085" offset="5042895">Imagine Argentina's world, if you will.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.285" offset="5051672">Argentina's world is that every timing question, whether something has to be filed on blue paper -- I have no idea what the line they want to draw is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.141" offset="5087094">Every procedural step is instead a condition on its consent to arbitrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.528" offset="5108619">And that doesn't seem to make any sense at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.980" offset="5118441">There have to be procedural prerequisites.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.748" offset="5125546">And Argentina would recharacterize this as, as I said, a unilateral agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.733" offset="5145504">So it's like Argentina says -- posts a sign on a pole and says if you pay me -- if you find my dog I will give you $100.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.739" offset="5177478">And so you have to perform an act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.389" offset="5184061">And it says we have to perform an act here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.474" offset="5192420">We have to go to the local courts or otherwise there is no agreement at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.578" offset="5208825">Well, a few things about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.462" offset="5216348">Arbitration is not a dog, and Article 8, if we just go back to page 8A, does not require us to submit it to the local courts at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.468" offset="5252397">This can't be a step that we are required to take because we are not required to take it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.172" offset="5271205">If I could just take you to the last two lines of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.640" offset="5281132">It shall be submitted at the request of one of the parties to the dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.341" offset="5299940">Argentina was just as entitled as us to put this into the local courts as we were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.929" offset="5322301">It can't have been an expectation that we had to do something before it would consent to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.666" offset="5345184">So I do think that this is just on all fours with John Wiley for that, for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.470" offset="5368381">The only other thing that has been put on the table in front of you is the question of whether Argentina's sovereignty should make a difference here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.893" offset="5398160">And this is kind of the second theme of the brief of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.111" offset="5414983">And I would say about that that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, which was discussed of course in the last argument, has an express waiver of sovereign immunity for arbitration awards that's controlled here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.085" offset="5458869">And if, when the Solicitor General's representative speaks, if that person were to talk about what the treatment of these issues in other countries is, we are unaware again of any country in the world where the arbitral system of review in the courts changes in the slightest because one party happens to be a signatory to a treaty, and that makes a ton of sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.099" offset="5546954">Again, this is fundamentally a commercial relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.884" offset="5558030">Argentina knew that it couldn't, in the crisis that gave rise to these investment treaties, Argentina couldn't get the money to come into the country if it hadn't agreed to arbitration.</text>

            <text syncTime="1396.372" offset="5691986">The important point I would make is that there is -- when the other side points to decisions in which a court reviews de novo a jurisdictional ruling of an arbitral tribunal, none of those decisions are unique in any way to the fact that it was an international arbitration or an international treaty arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.752" offset="5769517">Their international rule, the U.K. rule, the rule in lots of other countries, is simply about arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.239" offset="5791460">The reason that the other side can say that this case might well be reviewed de novo in the United Kingdom, for example, is that the jurisdictional decision in essentially every arbitration of any kind in the United Kingdom will be reviewed de novo.</text>

            <text syncTime="1468.637" offset="5981109">But even if it were the case, it's because the French have their own approach to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.607" offset="6000962">We have a system that says, look, if you can always run off to court because of any of these procedural objections -- it has to be on blue paper, you didn't write -- wait for the -- wait 30 days.</text>

            <text syncTime="1602.504" offset="6516515">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.872" offset="6526023">The government's position in this case is based on the fact that this case involves a bilateral investment treaty in which the state parties set forth a standing offer to arbitrate in the treaty itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.163" offset="6571163">Because it's the treaty that determines whether there is an arbitration agreement in this case, principles of treaty interpretation have to be used to assess whether there is an agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.185" offset="6607316">So therefore, applying the domestic law presumptions that are set forth in Howsam to this type of investor-state arbitration we think would not be appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.041" offset="6642738">Howsam shouldn't apply by its terms because the question here is a question of treaty interpretation, not a question of the likely expectations of parties to a domestic commercial contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="1646.966" offset="6694356">I mean, it seems to me the treaty sets the framework for an agreement, but it is ultimately the agreement that governs.</text>

            <text syncTime="1655.204" offset="6727375">Well, there is no agreement unless the investor submits the claim to arbitration in accordance with the terms of the treaty, the conditions on the state's consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.762" offset="6769589">So, for instance, in the United States investment treaties and free trade agreements such as NAFTA the United States says that an investor may submit a claim to arbitration only if it first satisfies certainly procedural conditions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1754.970" offset="7126421">Well, I think the reason that applying Howsam and its presumption that certain procedural-type requirements like notice requirements would be decided by the arbitrator, the reason that would risk subjecting a state to suit without its consent is that in investment treaties, what the states do is they say we will be subject to arbitration under certain circumstances.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas Goldstein</label>
            <text syncTime="3507.096" offset="14134970">Mr. Chief Justice, I do have a rule that distinguishes the A4 paper and that rule should be, and we think it does follow from the analysis of Howsam, which is just a thinking about when people make agreements and what they expect is that an arbitration agreement is formed and a party consents to arbitration when they guarantee that the ultimate decision can be made by an arbitrator and not a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.778" offset="14229638">It's form selection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.696" offset="14233295">We're going to have the ultimate decision made by the arbitrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.882" offset="14242072">And that rule is applied in the investment treaty context as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.100" offset="14254924">And it is, there is consent to arbitration when the investor is guaranteed that their claim can ultimately be decided by a court and the State can't force it to be ultimately -- excuse me -- by an arbitrator, and the State can't force it to ultimately be decided by a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.094" offset="14314901">And I'll show you where that rule, how that line is divided in this treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.662" offset="14333187">And that is, I gave you the three conditions at the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.278" offset="14343636">Those are not A4 paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.697" offset="14349279">You have to be a U.K. investor, you have to have a treaty claim, you have to be suing another party to the treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.235" offset="14383447">And if those aren't true, then there is no arbitration agreement and Argentina has every reason to say I have no idea why these arbitrators are here, this person's from Ecuador, not from the United Kingdom.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.091" offset="14422944">But at that point, once we are a U.K. investor and we have invested in Argentina, that's the performance that is required, once we did that, then we are protected by Article 8, the dispute resolution provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.399" offset="14472159">And you look at Article 8 and you, okay, does that guarantee that you have the right to ultimately have it decided by the arbitrators, or can Argentina actually insist that it will be ultimately decided by a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.120" offset="14514999">And it's the former.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.956" offset="14518343">We made clear, I think, and nobody disagrees, that they can't force us to go into court and wait for that ruling, take that ruling in any way, shape, or form.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.162" offset="14555228">Now my friend says that, look, this is like a unilateral agreement, and this is like where I say I'll hire you to paint my house if you post a bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.351" offset="14595979">Well, that is a terrible argument for them because this treaty reads as if he was saying, I'll let you paint my house if you post the bond or I post the bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.290" offset="14627744">Because, remember, the thing they want us to perform on, supposedly, is something they can do, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.009" offset="14646552">Who ever heard of unilateral agreement that was conditioned on either party doing something?</text>

            <text syncTime="3654.522" offset="14724606">I believe the answer, when this was put to them, his answer to your question was I just don't have to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.743" offset="14749475">His view was, and it's a perfectly fine position to take, and that is he's not going to help me win my case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.797" offset="14769746">Fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.397" offset="14772149">But it does describe whether this is a condition of consent, that he could do it too.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.132" offset="14795032">And if he could do it too, it can't be something that he is waiting for me to perform on at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.003" offset="14810497">I would say that on this question of whether it has any value, that all that you got, Justice Alito, was that if I were to pursue the case in the Argentine courts maybe something would happen, we might learn a little about Argentine law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3688.326" offset="14859816">First thing's first.</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.677" offset="14865249">I don't have to pursue it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3690.945" offset="14870265">Remember, his whole point is, when asked if the courts were closed, said I just have to put the piece of paper down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3695.747" offset="14889491">So if this were a treaty provision that actually involved litigation, involved exhaustion of remedies where we might learn something that might be a different case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.436" offset="14920315">But this is a waiting period in an Argentine court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3706.455" offset="14932332">And remember as well, these are treaty claims and it is perfectly clear and undisputed that the local court, even if it decided the treaty claims, their agreement would not bind the arbitrators.</text>
            <text syncTime="3717.677" offset="14977262">And so he says, well, hey, we might win.</text>

            <text syncTime="3738.506" offset="15060541">But let's figure out who we would ordinary expect to figure that out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3741.958" offset="15074333">This is a treaty provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3743.158" offset="15079140">It's the experts involved in treaty interpretation, are the three neutral arbitrators, who really do this every day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.646" offset="15105158">It's what they do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3750.414" offset="15108188">They have enormous expertise in interpreting treaties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3752.798" offset="15117697">And so you might say, and it would be a perfectly valid interpretation, well, maybe submitting it to the local court requires some activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3758.835" offset="15141834">But do we really expect when the U.K. and Argentina ended this treaty, that it would actually be the Supreme Court of the United States that would be deciding that question, or instead, the arbitrators.</text>
            <text syncTime="3769.810" offset="15185824">And if you believe it's the arbitrators then we win, because it's the kind of procedural question that we put to them purposely.</text>

            <text syncTime="3789.273" offset="15263669">Remember my friend said, look, if it weren't for this treaty we could never sue them.</text>

            <text syncTime="3799.829" offset="15305883">And so the whole point of this treaty is to put these disputes into arbitration.</text>
