            <label>Mr. Jonathan S. Massey</label>
            <text syncTime="8.951" offset="142197">That you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="11.809" offset="153690">The text and structure of the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005, which is known as CAFA, show that it does not extend to State parens patriae actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.475" offset="200293">If there are any doubt on the matter, CAFA would have to be narrowly construed as a matter of the principles of federalism that are at issue here, as evidenced by the 46 States supporting Mississippi before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.815" offset="249717">The disposition of the case today, we believe, is straightforward.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.735" offset="265390">There is only one plaintiff in this case, the State of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.780" offset="281481">It is not a citizen for purposes of diversity jurisdiction, and therefore, the requirements of even minimal diversity, let alone the 100-person numerosity requirement of CAFA, cannot be met.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.104" offset="334876">Our friends on the other side want to use the statute of CAFA to change that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.146" offset="359013">The mass action definition is the key part of the statute issued today.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.817" offset="377717">It is in the Joint Appendix at pages 79 to 80.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.674" offset="393077">Essentially, the attempt to force State actions into the mass action definition is a square-peg-round-hole kind of problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.374" offset="431947">The mass action definition addresses the situation of mass consolidation or mass joinder when there are 100 individual plaintiffs or more in a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.463" offset="476250">And CAFA provides that there's Federal jurisdiction over such a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.087" offset="490774">But that does not apply to this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.008" offset="506448">CAFA refers to real plaintiffs asserting concrete claims and further provides that those claims must be proposed to be tried jointly.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.190" offset="555140">None of that happens in a parens patriae case where the State is the only Plaintiff.</text>

            <text syncTime="117.344" offset="575829">Mr. Massey, with respect to that, there is a claim for restitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.859" offset="597877">I take it if the suit is successful, the money that's collected will be distributed to all the people who are affected by this conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="137.275" offset="655555">Well, Justice Ginsburg, that's very unlikely in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.788" offset="677602">The Plaintiffs -- the Plaintiff in this case is the State of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.739" offset="693380">The consumers of Mississippi have already sued in an indirect purchaser action that has been settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.908" offset="718040">So they have received compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.799" offset="725563">The State does have a restitution claim here.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.658" offset="737057">Your Honor is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.686" offset="741132">And at page 65(a) of the -- of the response to opposition of the orange briefs, 65(a) describes the restitution claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.167" offset="779062">The restitution claim seeks recovery to the State of the money, not to consumers in Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.353" offset="807797">And what's likely to happen here, and frankly what happens very frequently when the Federal Trade Commission or the Securities and Exchange Commission or any other State or agency seeks restitution, the money is recovered by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.019" offset="858474">And in a case like this, where it is very difficult to trace the individuals, the consumers who've been hurt -- after all, we're talking to LCD price-fixing conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.263" offset="907480">So every television, computer monitor, phone, toy, digital camera, car navigation system, there are no records, obviously, of who purchased them, and it would cost so much money to identify them.</text>

            <text syncTime="261.320" offset="1151672">Does your argument change if the facts are different?</text>

            <text syncTime="267.098" offset="1174765">I would say in our case the State -- just to be clear about restitution -- the State is proceeding under statutes that gives the -- the State the only cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.458" offset="1216247">Only the State can sue under these provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.302" offset="1223666">If the State -- the -- the consumers have separate damages statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.752" offset="1245400">The consumers would sue under separate statutes in a different court.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.112" offset="1258879">So the -- the -- in a different court, meaning in Mississippi, that would have to be in a circuit court, court of law as opposed to a court of equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.185" offset="1291166">But if a State were to seek restitution and to distribute it to consumers, just to be clear, our argument would not change because restitution is still a public remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="328.641" offset="1420943">The -- the simplest resolution of the case is simply a statutory argument, that on its face, the mass action definition refers to plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.529" offset="1452499">The only plaintiff is the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.247" offset="1459395">Even if the State has statutory authority to seek restitution, it is still the only plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.104" offset="1482801">So you would not even need to get into the real party-in-interest test, because the statute doesn't refer to unnamed parties or to people who might be real parties in interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.505" offset="1524388">It refers simply to the plaintiffs.</text>

            <text syncTime="379.526" offset="1624489">But then it says:</text>

            <text syncTime="683.297" offset="2839601">In that case the Washington Supreme Court encountered the situation where the State had sought restitution on behalf of consumers and sought to distribute the money to consumers, and consumers also brought separate damages actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.541" offset="2892577">And the Washington court said, there was no double recovery, no preclusion problem, because the restitution remedies were public in nature, and the private damages actions proceeded under different statutory authority for different claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="1568.465" offset="6380237">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.653" offset="6389014">The attorney general's interpretation of the mass action definition requires this Court to conclude that a mass action can only be one of the actions with 100 or more named plaintiffs, and can never be a representative action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.630" offset="6456933">That interpretation cannot be squared with the statutory language, the purpose of the Act and the structure of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.250" offset="6495385">Justice Kagan, you referred to the general public provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.703" offset="6509178">That provision expressly refers to the possibility of a representative action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.636" offset="6536972">In the parenthetical language in that provision, and, you know, I look at it on the -- in the Act form on 66a, but it's, of course, in the codification as well on page 79a of the Joint Appendix -- the parenthetical there says that -- that this exclusion does not apply in cases where the action is not on behalf of individual claimants or members of a purported class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.704" offset="6657240">So in other words, this exclusion under the mass action definition is contemplating a situation where there are individual claimants or members of a purported class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.750" offset="6709380">That -- that has to be beyond the named plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.624" offset="6728920">In another example, farther down in the exceptions to the mass action definition, there's a reference to Section 1407, which is the MDL transfer provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.213" offset="6775313">There again, there's reference to the possibility of a mass action being converted into a Rule 23 class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.819" offset="6805720">Those provisions don't make sense unless it's possible for a mass action to be a representative action.</text>

            <text syncTime="3221.665" offset="12993083">Now, in my remaining time perhaps, Justice Kagan, at the end of the day there was no carve-out in the statute for attorney general actions, even though that was sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.378" offset="13039894">But the Act does reflect some sensitivity for federalism concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.673" offset="13057135">It's got an exception for situations where States are the primary defendants, or State officials are the primary defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.701" offset="13093184">There is also a notification to State attorneys general when there's a settlement of a class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.510" offset="13116485">Those kinds of provisions show that Congress was trying to be sensitive and it was horse trading, it was cutting deals, it was log rolling, coming up with an Act here that was at once sensitive to federalism concerns, but also trying to solve the very real abuses that it had identified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.847" offset="13193808">And on the federalism point, the Attorney General's brief has a lot of citations to Eleventh Amendment issues, and some of this Court's precedents dealing with State sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.623" offset="13244903">I submit that those precedents and that Amendment deal only with situations where the State is a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.011" offset="13270503">And here, where we are talking about the State as a plaintiff, and the only intrusion we are talking about is removal from State court to Federal court, that is not on the same playing field as the authorities relied on by the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.193" offset="13331212">A couple of other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.285" offset="13351588">There was a suggestion in the reply brief that the complaint here was not in fact a copycat case, a copycat complaint, but instead was a summary of the Federal indictments, and that that explains the eerie similarity between the class action complaint and the Attorney General's complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.683" offset="13429119">That's just factually not right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.400" offset="13436015">Some companies who were defendants, like my client, Toshiba, was never charged or convicted of anything in this case, yet we're a defendant in this case, and that's because we were a defendant in the class action case that was copied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.770" offset="13489514">And in fact, the indictments against some companies bear very little resemblance to the complaint that the Attorney General has filed here in terms of the duration of the conspiracy and the subject matter of the products that are alleged -- were allegedly price-fixed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.981" offset="13562343">Unless there are any further questions, thank you.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jonathan S. Massey</label>
            <text syncTime="3371.009" offset="13590451">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.617" offset="13596825">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.365" offset="13619917">The issues that I'd like to raise on rebuttal are limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.052" offset="13630575">The most important thing is that jurisdictional schemes should be simple, administrable, predictable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.878" offset="13657952">The simplest route -- the simplest interpretation is the one we have shown, that these -- the statute is directed at actual plaintiffs with concrete claims that are proposed to be tried jointly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.872" offset="13705912">The only thing our friends on the other side have pointed out is the use of the -- is the word “ persons ”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.886" offset="13729945">Justice Sotomayor is 100 percent correct that the word “ persons ” is basically -- is an echo of Rule 20, of the joinder rule, which also refers to persons and plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.678" offset="13773099">So the fact that Congress used the word “ person ” once in a mass action definition simply confirms our point that the statute is really directed at the mass joinder, mass consolidation situation, and does not have anything to do with actions by sovereign States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.031" offset="13838510">Their primary argument seems to be that the Attorney General doesn't really own the claims in this case, that these are claims that are owned by the citizens of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.652" offset="13877067">That is a classic State law issue, which should be raised on remand in the State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.728" offset="13897338">A very similar--</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="3448.946" offset="13902144">Did not the Fifth Circuit decide that State law question?</text>

            <text syncTime="3453.195" offset="13919176">--No, Your Honor, we don't believe so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.820" offset="13925654">That the Fifth Circuit ruled on its -- the interpretation of CAFA and said that for purposes of the statute, the claims were removable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.907" offset="13962017">But it didn't decide the attorney general's authority to sue in the name of the State under the statutes which give him that authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.607" offset="14000887">The -- we don't think the Fifth Circuit decided that question, and I read the red brief at page 33 as saying the attorney general's authority is not at issue here, that we assume the attorney general has the authority to bring the claims in the complaint as he pled them, which is the restitution claimed in the name of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.193" offset="14079150">And the -- there was a decision in Mississippi in 2006, the only really relevant authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.862" offset="14097854">It's called the BASF case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.799" offset="14105586">And there, a lower court in Mississippi, the Chancery Court, upheld the attorney general's authority to bring a very similar parens patriae case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3508.328" offset="14139754">What he says is -- in the complaint, it says --</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.654" offset="14153024">"prays that the defendant be ordered to restitute any and all moneys for the purchases of its citizens. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.430" offset="14356152">All right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.635" offset="14192939">Now, you look at the statute he quoted, the Mississippi statute, and it says there is the authority to have restitution to restore to any person in interest any moneys which may have been acquired by means of a practice prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.191" offset="14251140">So he says that sounds as if what you're talking about is you want restitution, though, given to the State, the restitution is for individual purchases of individual citizens, because there could be no other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.186" offset="14303176">And, therefore, you have a list of people in mind, or you must find one, where there were particular individual purchases by individual citizens and get that restitution into the treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.993" offset="14358347">Now, that -- I think something like that was his argument, and I wanted to know what you were going to say.</text>
