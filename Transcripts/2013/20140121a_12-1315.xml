            <text syncTime="11.206" offset="151612">This Court has never applied laches to constrict a Federal statute of limitations, and rejected such a claim just four years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.645" offset="185466">Laches cannot bar these copyright infringement claims for four reasons: First, under the separate accrual rule, these claims are timely.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.083" offset="219217">Respondents committed these discrete wrongs from 2006 on, but would use Petitioner's failure to challenge earlier wrongs to foreclose these later claims before they even arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.958" offset="262684">Second, laches is a gap filler, but Congress filled this gap with a Bright-line statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.712" offset="289643">Third, Congress chose a clear, predictable timeliness rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.997" offset="306779">And fourth, injunctive relief must remain available to protect Petitioner's property right against ongoing violations, less Respondents effectively get a compulsory license for free for the next four decades.</text>

            <text syncTime="105.150" offset="527461">Laches domain was as a gap filler where there was no -- no timeliness rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.554" offset="549091">Congress has occupied the field with a timeliness rule here and displaced it.</text>

            <text syncTime="152.645" offset="717424">That -- this court in Holmberg v. Armbrecht understood this almost as a Chevron-type argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="161.234" offset="751801">If yes, Holmberg says the congressional statute is definitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.020" offset="766952">If not, Holmberg says then its silence delegates the matter to, quote, ‶ judicial implication ″.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.274" offset="791925">And then there's some judicial flexibility on timeliness issues.</text>

            <text syncTime="736.051" offset="3050994">Mr. Bibas, I would have thought that there was something in the copyright context that cuts against you, and that's that because of this separate accrual rule and the feature of these roll-in statutes of limitations combined with very, very lengthy copyrights terms, that essentially a plaintiff can not bring suit for years, decades and time the suit in order to maximize her own gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.086" offset="3171158">That strikes me as something that we don't usually see in statute of limitations cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.804" offset="3194041">I mean, you don't have very many cases where courts have applied laches as against the statute of limitations, but that's because you can't think of many instances in which it would be considered unfair to take the entire statute of limitations to bring a suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.333" offset="3256212">But in this context, you look at something that seems very different.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.368" offset="3272304">A plaintiff can wait 20 years given the way the separate accrual work -- rule works.</text>

            <text syncTime="801.592" offset="3313159">Whether our client brings suit now or 20 years from now, she gets three and only three years' damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.227" offset="3335729">The evidence in this case is that creative works are worth the most right after they're released.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.715" offset="3357672">And so the value of the claim goes down.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.333" offset="3368121">Respondents get to keep the first 17 years of profits if she waits.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.035" offset="3382959">So she has every incentive, as the amicus briefs indicate, to file suit early.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.339" offset="3404170">And, indeed, courts can use adverse inferences against plaintiffs who delay, draw inferences and missing witness instructions from their delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.677" offset="3429561">But let me point out that there are plenty of situations in which there is a delay in suit.</text>

            <text syncTime="840.567" offset="3469058">The mortgagee who waits until year 20 doesn't get to claim 20 years' worth of payments, but there's nothing that debars that mortgagee from claiming payments for years 17 to 20.</text>

            <text syncTime="956.570" offset="3933097">The only question before the Court is whether the courts below were right to bar this suit entirely on laches ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.688" offset="3953577">And on that question, we agree entirely with Petitioner, that the suit should not have been barred at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.841" offset="3974162">But it is the government's view that laches is available in extraordinary cases to bar copyright infringement claims brought within the statute of limitations for 2 reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.297" offset="4011987">First of all, laches, like equitable tolling and other equitable principles, was a background principle that Congress acted against when it enacted the statute of limitations and it said nothing to bar it.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.753" offset="4057858">We've already had the discussion here at Court today about the text and how it doesn't bar it.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.490" offset="4072800">But second, for the reasons that Justice Kagan gave, the copyright situation is unique in that there is this separate accrual rule which allows a person to sue many years after the infringing conduct started so that it makes sense to at least be able to consider laches.</text>

            <text syncTime="1424.870" offset="5806286">The reason that we are distinguishing between law and equity are two reasons: First of all, there is a very long history that laches is unique to the courts of equity, and this Court has recognized it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.577" offset="5849127">It recognized it in Mack, it recognized in the Oneida case, it recognized it in Merck, it was in the Pomeroy treatise that this was a classic division that was only in equity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1533.924" offset="6242531">First of all in terms of the time period, it doesn't have a statute of limitations in which -- after which a claim is barred.</text>

            <text syncTime="1722.894" offset="6998410">The Holmberg case is in many ways our best case, Justice Sotomayor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.180" offset="7015546">Let's look at what Holmberg said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.315" offset="7020144">Holmberg was, remember, discussed in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.917" offset="7030488">Congress, somebody in Congress focused on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.950" offset="7038639">It says, first, when Congress leaves to the Federal courts the formulation of remedial details, it can hardly expect them to break with historic principles of equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.122" offset="7075314">And we know from both the House and the Senate report this 1957 statute specifically said the remedial details are up to the court because we want the courts to continue to apply equity considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.330" offset="7120141">So what are those equitable principles?</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.180" offset="7127559">This Court went on in Holmberg and said: First, a suit in equity may fail though not barred by the act of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.167" offset="7151488">That's a pretty clear equitable principle and, of course, we win this case under that principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.785" offset="7169982">And then the Court went on and articulated the goose and gander rule, that these are two sides of the same coin; that laches and tolling go together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.640" offset="7205404">They travel together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.591" offset="7209166">They are not cousins, Justice Kennedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.342" offset="7216167">They are fraternal twins.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.961" offset="7222645">You don't get one without the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.028" offset="7230900">And what the Court said is if want of due diligence by the plaintiff may make it unfair to pursue the defendants, laches, then also fraudulent conduct on the part of the defendant may make it unfair for the plaintiff to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.638" offset="7285339">Fraudulent concealment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.388" offset="7292340">And then the Court said -- and this is the critical point -- it cited Bailey v. Glover, which also had the goose-and-gander rule embedded in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.392" offset="7316372">It said this equity doctrine is read into every Federal statute of limitations; not fraudulent concealment, but the twin nature of tolling plus laches, that every time the courts have the power to adjust the rights and obligations of the parties using their equitable powers, that happens on the front end and on the back end.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.038" offset="7394949">My friend, Mr. Bibas, has to respond to that by saying: Tolling is available, discovery is available, waiver, abandonment, acquiescence, estoppel and all of the other equitable doctrines, eight of which are listed in Rule 8 that this Court has determined are available in all civil actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.333" offset="7460150">But, he says, laches -- which this Court also listed in Rule 8, is not available in this civil action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.737" offset="7489826">That is a bizarre argument, Your Honor, and it has no support whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.558" offset="7509052">This Court confronted the same point -- excuse me.</text>

            <text syncTime="1855.527" offset="7528905">‶ Bizarre ″ seems to me a little strong, because I take it that Mr. Bibas is making a statutory argument -- I mean, he's saying not the language of the statute, but he's saying what was Congress thinking at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.019" offset="7578955">Congress was faced with all of these precedents, essentially saying laches was not available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.273" offset="7603928">There are no cases out there really where laches does cut into a defined statute of limitations period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.446" offset="7636634">And then you have the feature that if Congress knew that it was enacting these rolling statutes of limitations, you would have thought that it might have been foremost in their head, how are we going to prevent somebody from suing 30 years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.087" offset="7687207">And they did nothing of the kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.887" offset="7694417">They could very easily have made it clear that laches applied or they could have set an outer limit or they could have done a number of things, and they really didn't do any of them.</text>

            <text syncTime="3409.722" offset="13745734">Five points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.958" offset="13750645">First, Justice Sotomayor was entirely right that Holmberg, Russell, Mack and Merck just four years ago make this settled law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.730" offset="13789724">There is a reason Justice Kagan says that we can't see laches in cases like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.883" offset="13810413">We don't see it foreclosing ongoing and future wrongs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.935" offset="13826609">We've never seen laches used to measure the delay before the wrong occurred to foreclose ongoing and future claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.025" offset="13854926">Laches is normally about the delay between the wrong and the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.243" offset="13871853">And this invented category of rolling statutes of limitations, this Court in Klehr carefully distinguished separately accruing discrete wrongs within a limitations period from continuing violations that reach back beyond the limitations period to claim damages beyond that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.772" offset="13937891">When my friend says we could have brought this exact same suit in 1991, he is absolutely incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.526" offset="13964954">If they had stopped infringing in 2005, the entire statutory penalty for my client would have been no recovery from 1991 until 2005.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.864" offset="14002257">Second, the only two precedents my friend can rely upon from this court, in the face of a wall of precedent noted by Justice Sotomayor, are Morgan and Bay Area Laundry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.404" offset="14040500">Bay Area Laundry had a statutory provision, 29 U.S.C. 1399(b)(1), that required an employer to bring claims as soon as practical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.945" offset="14082609">The only context in which there was an aside in that case, not even an application of holding, was saying that as soon as practical is a laches-like doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.718" offset="14117718">The only case that looks remotely close that my friend cites in his brief is the Morgan case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.387" offset="14140392">And Morgan is completely distinguishable for two reasons: The first is Morgan involved bootstrapping damages from beyond the limitations period, claiming damages from before the 180 or 300-day filing period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.647" offset="14197443">We claim no damages before 2006.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.666" offset="14209460">Second, my friend is absolutely incorrect in saying there was a statute of limitations in Morgan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.987" offset="14230776">Title 7 contains no statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.605" offset="14245300">It contains a filing timeliness requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.974" offset="14258779">One of the pillars of this Court's decision in Morgan is, you can reach back for damages for two years as shown by the backpay provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.295" offset="14284066">Since we don't have a limit on damages, we might possibly consider a limit -- a laches-like limitation in a future case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.048" offset="14311024">That was not the holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.983" offset="14314786">It was not briefed and argued, but there was a mention of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.300" offset="14324085">So Morgan was not within the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.785" offset="14334012">There was no statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.220" offset="14339759">And when this Court interpreted it in Ledbetter, it understood Morgan is about continuing violations rescuing untimely claims for untimely damages before limitations period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.426" offset="14380510">The lower courts my friend refers to, by the way, he and I have jointly not found a single case that was entirely barred in the Second, Sixth, Tenth, or Eleventh Circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.051" offset="14423037">In the cases that adopt a -- the circuits that adopt a rare case standard, in theory leaving the door open, they have not cited and we have not found in the Sixth, Tenth, or Eleventh Circuit a single case that found that standard met as to damages or injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.958" offset="14478626">And, yes, we do claim damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.710" offset="14485626">Our complaint, Joint Appendix 30 claims damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.445" offset="14500568">Joint Appendix 34, the prayer for relief is phrased in terms of damages, not an accounting for profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.016" offset="14522929">Third, Justice -- oh, and by the way, the Posner opinion that was cited said that's only because there's no statutory limitations period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.689" offset="14553545">There's no congressional separation of powers problem because under the statute interpreted in that Posner opinion, there was no statutory limitation period by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.426" offset="14584578">Third, Justice Kennedy's point about estoppel as a cousin.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.913" offset="14598475">It is not a twin.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.097" offset="14603177">First, you can have an estoppel after a one-week delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.400" offset="14620418">Estoppel has no element requiring delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.000" offset="14630867">Laches requires a long delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.352" offset="14636196">Estoppel requires affirmative, intentional misconduct causing loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.756" offset="14657826">I'd point out those elements are substantially more stringent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.474" offset="14668692">Moreover, estoppel, like tolling and discovery rule, were settled law as of 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.576" offset="14689172">Tolling and discovery rule were cited in the legislative history by the legal advisor to the Copyright Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.747" offset="14709861">But the Holmberg case that was cited to that court said very different rule is the background rule as to laches.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.920" offset="14738492">No laches within the congressional law period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3659.836" offset="14746224">Finally, let me point out that because estoppel was settled, it remains available to catch the worst cases of prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.340" offset="14772242">It remains available for the manipulative scenarios outlined by my friend.</text>
            <text syncTime="3669.977" offset="14786766">Fourth point, uncertainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.762" offset="14797842">I think it's quite salient that Justice Kagan pointed out that if we were to recognize laches here, for the first time, for the first time within the congressional statute of limitations, we'd open a whole new field of litigation over laches.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.535" offset="14840996">When do I file?</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.737" offset="14845803">This Court just a week ago in the Ray Haluch Gravel opinion said timeliness rules need to be clear, simple, predictable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3691.057" offset="14871089">Parties need to know when to file.</text>
            <text syncTime="3693.174" offset="14879553">We frequently see plaintiffs filing on or shortly before the day the limitation period expires.</text>
            <text syncTime="3698.811" offset="14902123">If this Court were to cloud that, then there'd be a rush of preemptive litigation coming into court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.615" offset="14921349">Moreover, I think Justice Breyer's point is quite right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3706.401" offset="14932425">You shouldn't have to file 15 damages suits one after another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3710.603" offset="14949248">From Blackstone to Story to the Marshall Court, one of the principles of equity was you don't have to keep filing injunctive relief.</text>
