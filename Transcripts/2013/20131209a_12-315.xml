            <text syncTime="11.056" offset="152285">Not even Mr. Hoeper can defend the decision below and for good reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.110" offset="172452">Under the plain terms of the statute and consistent with this Court's First Amendment precedence, truth matters, and airlines should not lose their ATSA immunity unless their statements are materially false.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.750" offset="219054">None of that is in dispute anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.602" offset="226473">Also not in dispute, I think, is that Air Wisconsin was justified in picking up the phone, calling TSA and conveying certain core facts; namely, that Mr. Hoeper was mad at the airline; that he was a Federal flight deck officer or FFDO; that he had walked out on his training, his last chance to keep his job, and he was about to board a plane.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.349" offset="313408">I don't believe any of those facts are in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.985" offset="323962">What is in dispute is how those facts were framed or phrased to TSA in that call.</text>

            <text syncTime="89.740" offset="467008">If we had conveyed those core facts using different words, there would not be any issue.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jonathan F. Cohn</label>
            <text syncTime="98.193" offset="500759">And the question, Justice Scalia, is whether we framed or phrased the report in an adequate manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.499" offset="526045">And in assessing that issue, the question comes down to how much breathing space airlines should be given in making these reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.520" offset="558124">How much room there should be for permissible characterization and expression in making these reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.174" offset="580693">And context should be kept in mind in answering that question, three things in particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.911" offset="603681">First, these reports are being made by airline employees such as pilots and flight attendants and baggage handlers and ticket agents who are being told by TSA, they have to report in realtime without investigation, without calling their lawyer, without stopping to think on how to refine the perfect script.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.741" offset="686959">And they are being told to do this based upon their suspicions.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.110" offset="700439">In some cases, suspicions of other people's emotions or state of mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.014" offset="720083">That's one critical piece of context.</text>

            <text syncTime="161.086" offset="752370">You said that the Respondents conceded.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.072" offset="768357">But -- but isn't it the case that it was the Colorado Supreme Court that said that the airline likely would have been immune if they had phrased the report more cautiously?</text>

            <text syncTime="239.964" offset="1067929">And that's why TSA says, if you don't report sincerely-held concerns, you might be sanctioned by us for failing to make the report, placing airlines between a rock and a hard place.</text>

            <text syncTime="278.939" offset="1223828">The question's about the statutory immunity and the Aviation Transportation Security Act, ATSA, and whether that immunity requires a determination of whether or not the statement was materially false.</text>

            <text syncTime="323.717" offset="1402924">I believe they feel the jury should answer that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.169" offset="1416716">Again, that issue is not strictly before the Court, but I think on the issue that is before the Court, they agree that material falsity is part of the ATSA analysis.</text>

            <text syncTime="341.928" offset="1475753">Now, if you say, well, even if it is, the judge -- the Court has a duty to determine as a matter of law at the outset, then that's something else.</text>

            <text syncTime="1056.057" offset="4332295">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.759" offset="4343057">It's essentially undisputed that in order to encourage airlines to report suspicious activity to proper authorities the ATSA immunizes such reports when they're materially true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.865" offset="4383495">I want to emphasize two main points about the scope of that immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.083" offset="4396347">First, ATSA gives airlines very wide latitude in how they describe the suspicious activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.904" offset="4419648">These reports are made against an inherently uncertain factual backdrop, and that's why the statute protects reports of any suspicious transaction relevant to a possible violation of law or regulation relating to air safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.730" offset="4474924">Misconceptions and exaggerations can occur not only because of confusion about the facts, but because of the emotion, the stress, and potentially even the fear that may go along with making one of these reports.</text>

            <text syncTime="1115.761" offset="4571054">And -- and if so, then it -- it seems to me that the airline is under a duty more strict than the one that you have just explained and the Petitioner's counsel has explained.</text>

            <text syncTime="1130.437" offset="4629777">Well, Your Honor, I think there's a distinction between Masson and this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.007" offset="4648063">Masson follows the more general defamation law rule about whether a statement is materially false in terms of a person's reputation, whereas here the focus is on what a reasonable security official would believe, and we think that's fairly seen in the text of the statute, which, again, protects statements about any suspicious transaction relevant to possible violation of law or regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.790" offset="4743149">So what the statements are intended to convey is a suspicion of a possible threat and the gist in this context, what has to be true in this context, is the suspicion of the possible threat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.312" offset="4785258">Now, I want to emphasize that because the statute talks about suspicions and possibilities, that the actual factual basis for what's reported doesn't need to be particularly strong.</text>

            <text syncTime="1193.546" offset="4882225">I think in Masson, you were talking about readers of a general interest magazine, The New Yorker Magazine, whereas here, the audience for these reports is much more specialized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.050" offset="4916184">It's law enforcement officers who are receiving reports of suspicious activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.187" offset="4932798">Now, they're not interested in someone's reputation as a general matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.405" offset="4945650">What they're interested in is what kind of threat the person might pose and what might happen to an airplane in the next period of time that they have to worry about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.978" offset="4975952">And I think it's particularly important that the Court give wide latitude to statements in this context because there's a substantially similar provision that protects individuals who make reports to law enforcement authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.119" offset="5024540">That's in 6 U.S.C. 1104.</text>

            <text syncTime="1678.923" offset="6823750">There's a legal question about the proper interpretation of ATSA and maybe some subsidiary questions about the division of authority between judge and jury and what the materiality standard is; and then there's a question about what to do with this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.247" offset="6873069">And those two sets of things should be considered differently because much of what's being argued here today was not presented to the lower courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1741.763" offset="7075048">Let me unpack that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.347" offset="7081422">I think there is three parts to that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.149" offset="7088631">The first is, implicit in that is ATSA immunity factual questions for the court or for the jury?</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.069" offset="7116321">And we agree with the government that you should apply the ordinary qualified immunity standards and historical disputes about the facts are handled by the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.973" offset="7143906">Of course, if the court can say, look, even on the plaintiff's view of the facts immunity is proper, you can enter summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.877" offset="7167521">The second question is what is the materiality standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.096" offset="7180373">Justice Scalia, you've suggested that the standard is would TSA have done the same thing any way?</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.150" offset="7200644">And I take the government even to be saying that that's not the right test, because we can't know because TSA won't tell us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.820" offset="7227289">TSA has to keep secret its procedures about what it would do and when; and as a consequence, I think the proper standard is the standard that applies under New York Times and in other defamation cases, which is the Masson standard: Would a true statement have a different effect on the security officials' mind?</text>

            <text syncTime="3192.248" offset="12877053">So one possibility is -- it depends very much on when the call was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.050" offset="12892204">Part of the difficulty here was raised was that Mr. Darr waited for two and a half hours after receiving this information before making the call.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.603" offset="12914460">Had the call been made earlier, there was testimony there was lots of things they could have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.072" offset="12928357">They could have called and checked to see if he had checked in his gun at security.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.626" offset="12946538">They could have found him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.893" offset="12951658">They could have called him on his cell phone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.578" offset="12958346">But even having waited as long as they did, they could have asked somebody on the airplane to just go and ask him and talk to him and see if there was reason to believe that there was something amiss that would require going back to the gate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.303" offset="13009232">Now, I acknowledge that, again because the call was so late, there really wasn't a ton that could be done, but that's not a reason to give them greater leeway.</text>

            <text syncTime="3288.125" offset="13260530">But certainly you can understand why TSA would not want something like this to happen again because, you know, when somebody is given false information that -- particularly when it leads to an elevated response that wouldn't have been necessary under a proper report, that gives rise to security concerns and dangers in itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.869" offset="13335554">When you send armed men onto a plane full of nervous people in close quarters who don't know what's going on and officers who believe that there may be a man on the gun -- with a gun who's mentally unstable on the plane, that is a recipe for danger and for accidental things to happen and for people to get hurt, in addition to diverting attention from things that might be actually more serious incidents that are going on at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.654" offset="13434610">Congress didn't think that the way to promote airline security here is simply to give carte blanche immunity to anybody who reports anything about suspicious activity, if they thought they could have ended at subsection A.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.644" offset="13490617">Instead, they recognized that there's a balance and that people who make bad faith reports that are materially untrue ought not to be immune, recognizing that there might be some deterrent effect at the margins, but acknowledging the need to strike this balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.856" offset="13555505">And in this case, whatever you end up doing in this case, and I would like to come back, before I leave, to this point, that this case has been litigated up the chain without any request for ATSA-specific materiality instruction, with the court addressing every material truth objection that was actually made in the context in which it was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.102" offset="13644426">And it's important to point out that they never, even when they argued material truth, argued that mentally unstable or were concerned about mental instability was materially true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.810" offset="13683296">The only argument they ever made about that, and you can read it at the appendix to the Red Brief, was that this was a protected statement of opinion because it could not be true or false.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.348" offset="13717464">And there's a world of difference between saying that something isn't true or false and saying that it is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.635" offset="13738571">Because to determine whether it's protected opinion, you only have to look at the statement to determine whether it's substantially true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.456" offset="13761872">You have to look at the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.908" offset="13767619">And so they have not -- at the very least, they have not preserved any argument that the statement “ mentally unstable ” was materially true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.078" offset="13796354">So at the end of the day, we think that you can satisfy the government's need for clarity about what the legal standard is by simply saying ATSA protects true statements, full stop, but, nonetheless, affirming this case, the opinion in this case on the ground that the Colorado court asked whether these statements were true and said that there was sufficient evidence that they were not and resolved every materiality objection that they actually made in the course of their opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.597" offset="13918398">The fact that they did it under a different subheading, that they asked the right question under the wrong subheading, isn't a ground for reversal in this case.</text>
