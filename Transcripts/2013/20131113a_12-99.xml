            <text syncTime="1588.950" offset="6461724">I just read the passage and all that it's saying is: Find out if in this case there was some corruption involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="1619.766" offset="6585022">First, the issue of course are the three individual provisions, not organizing agreements as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.655" offset="6604562">The three things at issue here of course is the gag clause, the use of property, and the information, not the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.325" offset="6627236">But secondly, the Eleventh Circuit's opinion comes from its holding that this intangible assistance can't be delivered, it can only be paid, and therefore, the court held you needed to show consideration for payment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1661.858" offset="6753460">And then it goes on to say that consideration would show that the purposes of the statute are implicated by the transaction, because in that case the union is being influenced by what the employer gave.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.400" offset="6799540">So the Eleventh Circuit, when it said that not all ground rules agreements will violate 302 was saying that if no consideration was given, there would be no payment and therefore no violation in that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3271.437" offset="13191703">It's the fact that it's given by the employer, which creates the danger: What will the union give in exchange.</text>

            <text syncTime="3286.308" offset="13251158">And unions have compromised employee interests in exchange for this type of assistance.</text>

            <text syncTime="3391.539" offset="13672147">That 100,000 is troubling to me because I think what the circuit was saying is if the 100,000 bought the peaceful recognition provisions, then that's corrupt, and that is outside the exemptions that the law provides.</text>

            <text syncTime="3496.387" offset="14091569">But instead, it was actually the union's own exercise of its speech and petition rights as it campaigned for the passage of the initiative that would allow the company to get into business in the first place as a casino.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.851" offset="14141411">So, if the violation turns on the union's exercise of its own First Amendment rights, then there's a more severe problem here than Section 302, I believe.</text>

            <text syncTime="3527.937" offset="14217688">It's a little different, but also very similar to the promises that are actually on the face of the memorandum itself, because the union agrees to waive its First Amendment rights to engage in picketing and boycott activity, as well as the employer waiving some of its rights with respect to its freedom of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.038" offset="14302116">So this is a case where there are multiple waivers of rights, both speech rights and property rights, going back and forth between the two parties for a central, completely legitimate purpose, and that is, the employer getting into business and the union getting the opportunity to organize its employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.453" offset="14375781">That's all there is in this picture, is the union, like so many construction unions that we know, advocating in Congress for the passage of laws like the Keystone Pipeline Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.603" offset="14428340">Why did they do that?</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.040" offset="14434087">They do it because they want the jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.117" offset="14446417">They hope that if they help the industry develop a pipeline, that their members will work on those jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.286" offset="14475151">That is a combination of interests funneled through the First Amendment's protection for mutual effort, as the Court recognized in Pennington, and, of course, the Noerr-Pennington Doctrine is one of our most important constitutional protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.498" offset="14539935">That's all that happened in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.889" offset="14545577">So there's nothing nefarious about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.466" offset="14555817">What -- there is -- there are some extremely damaging things that the Respondents' very simplistic argument will -- would accomplish if it were adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.164" offset="14594583">Justice Kagan referred to the -- the grievance procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.194" offset="14610779">Well, there's also arbitration in this agreement, as well as in collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.755" offset="14633035">But one searches in vain in 302(c) for any exception for arbitration, even though the Court has said over so many years that it is the most important thing under the Labor Management Relations Act.</text>
