            <text syncTime="6.468" offset="132557">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="8.654" offset="141334">Section 1382 makes it a misdemeanor for a person to reenter a military base after having been ordered not to do so by the commanding officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.354" offset="176129">Now, the Ninth Circuit here added another requirement for conviction, which is that the defendant must be found in a place that, as a matter of real property law, is within the exclusive possession of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.660" offset="229315">That requirement isn't anywhere in the text of the statute, no court has ever given an explanation of where it comes from, and Respondent no longer defends that requirement.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="41.344" stopTime="49.903">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="41.344" offset="272051">But it is -- it is in the Air Force manual and in a JAG opinion, was the exclusive possession criterion.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="benjamin_j_horwich" startTime="49.903" stopTime="86.014">
            <label>Mr. Benjamin J. Horwich</label>
            <text syncTime="49.903" offset="306324">Well, I think I would say a couple things about those sources, Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.386" offset="324191">First of all, the -- they reflect, essentially, conservative legal advice that recognizes that some courts had made a reference to such a requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.616" offset="365151">So the responsible thing to do if you're in a JAG rendering an opinion on what the right way to structure a lease is or whether a particular place is, in fact, covered by 1382 is to confirm that, yes, this would meet the criteria that the courts have established.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.094" offset="427114">But that doesn't -- certainly doesn't make it binding on this Court and other courts have held to the contrary.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="86.014" stopTime="98.212">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="86.014" offset="450728">Has -- since this case has been pending quite a while, has the manual changed, has -- to -- to delete the exclusive possession?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="benjamin_j_horwich" startTime="98.212" stopTime="171.450">
            <label>Mr. Benjamin J. Horwich</label>
            <text syncTime="98.212" offset="499525">If Your Honor is referring to the -- the U.S. Attorneys' manual, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.195" offset="515512">It hasn't been altered.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.680" offset="517393">Although I -- I would say that the very first section of the U.S. Attorneys' manual makes clear that it -- it doesn't -- it's not intended to create rights, it's not intended to bind the Department of Justice or otherwise modify the meanings of criminal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.175" offset="575385">It's simply a reference guide.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.674" offset="581341">And it is a reference guide that certainly would be accurate in some circuits, we think incorrect, and that's what, of course, this Court is now in a position to resolve the disagreement between the courts on that -- on that subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.450" offset="628466">So what Respondent does argue -- because, of course, Respondent isn't even defending that requirement here, is that -- and what the case then comes down to, I guess, is that Vandenberg Air Force Base is not a military installation.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.083" offset="698996">Now, we think it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.707" offset="705475">And we think all of it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.082" offset="711012">And the reason for that is that the statute refers comprehensively to a long list of places, reservation, fort, post, arsenal, yard, station, installation, that covers the range of places that are subject to military command.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.857" offset="774124">And Vandenberg is, of course, a place that's subject to military command.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.465" offset="788544">And in particular--</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="171.450" offset="792515">How do we tell that, Mr. Horwich?</text>
            <text syncTime="172.981" offset="798575">What's the test for determining when a place is subject to military command?</text>

          <turn speaker="benjamin_j_horwich" startTime="178.666" stopTime="210.607">
            <label>Mr. Benjamin J. Horwich</label>
            <text syncTime="178.666" offset="821354">--Military command is a question of lawful authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.056" offset="838908">What might be thought of, in a civilian context, as the extent of the commanding officer's jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.866" offset="866180">And so what -- the way things are set up is that the civilian leadership in the Department of Defense defines spaces, and then the military commanders who are appointed by the president, then, through appointing subordinate commands, will have units assigned to particular bases, and the commanding officer of the unit will be the commanding officer of the base to which the unit is assigned.</text>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="210.607" offset="949145">Well, some military installations are located in very rural areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.356" offset="968162">Now, suppose you have an installation in such a place and there are buildings and -- and facilities that you can see in one part of this territory, but there's a lot of open -- there are a lot of open fields around it.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.289" offset="1027826">Would -- and suppose there's -- it's not posted.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.958" offset="1042559">Would that still be a military installation if somebody goes on that?</text>

            <label>Mr. Benjamin J. Horwich</label>
            <text syncTime="238.690" offset="1061471">It -- it would, although let me say a few things about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.080" offset="1075055">Your description, actually, is pretty apt as to Vandenberg itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.157" offset="1095326">It's in a rural area.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.578" offset="1100968">There are large areas of what you, I think, accurately described as open fields, that are there precisely to serve as a -- kind of a buffer zone around these enormous rocket launches.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.590" offset="1145063">And some parts of it are particularly posted; other parts aren't.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.212" offset="1163558">We do think that there would -- that a defendant needs to be put on notice in some -- in some respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.771" offset="1201801">We refer to it, I think, inartfully in our brief as actually that the defendant would have knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.393" offset="1220296">I think it's more the defendant needs to be on notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.393" offset="1228237">And like ascertaining the extent of any geographic place, the place to look, for starters, is a map.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.048" offset="1254882">And if you look at a -- nowadays, you go on the Internet and pull up any map, it will show you an area marked off as Vandenberg Air Force Base.</text>

          <turn speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="295.653" stopTime="314.692">
            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="295.653" offset="1289259">But a map, presumably, reflects who owns the property, and you, yourself, say that that's not what's significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.307" offset="1319875">And I took your point in your brief to suggest some kind of more functional test, is this property being used for military purposes?</text>
            <text syncTime="311.271" offset="1351744">Am I -- am I wrong in ascribing that to you?</text>

            <text syncTime="315.973" offset="1370552">We don't -- we're not suggesting a functional test.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.175" offset="1379434">What we're suggesting is that the coverage of 1382 should be coextensive with the commander's authority, which is, essentially, as I sort of suggested, in the nature of a jurisdictional test.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.733" offset="1417677">Where does the commander's regulatory and barment authority extend to as a matter of military law?</text>
            <text syncTime="334.965" offset="1446516">It should be backed up by a misdemeanor sanction in 1382.</text>

            <text syncTime="338.464" offset="1460518">But I'm not sure that I can -- that I follow that completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.072" offset="1479012">When I look at the list of items mentioned in the statute -- reservation, post, fort, arsenal, yard, station, or installation -- I don't think of command separate from operational control or being run by and used by the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.422" offset="1556335">Each of those terms has an operational quality to it that mere ownership, which I equate with command, doesn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.778" offset="1593847">It makes no sense, in answer to Justice Alito's question, to say you need notice, unless that facility has a military flavor to it that someone could know about.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.647" offset="1661243">And you talk about this particular camp, but you've got a whole green line around it to tell people which sections you are actually considering the camp, and he was found outside of that green area.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.013" offset="1750790">You've got a public school, a public highway.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.215" offset="1763538">I'm not quite sure how you can keep a person off of lands that the military is not using in its operations.</text>

            <text syncTime="422.197" offset="1795512">Well, I guess, just to take the last point there, I would disagree with the premise that the military is not using these lands in their operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.270" offset="1835741">I mean, to take -- to take one example, there will be -- there's a launch tomorrow at Vandenberg, and the other highway that's kind of indistinguishable from Highway 1, for these purposes, is going to be closed down because it's in the area that's dangerous because it's in the potential impact zone--</text>

            <text syncTime="455.511" offset="1928737">But I would be clear that the reason that is being closed down is because the commanding officer at Vandenberg has determined that that property, which is owned by the United States, is placed under his -- placed under his authority as a commanding officer, is -- is -- is assigned to the Department of the Air Force for administration, he has determined that his military needs require closing that -- that part on that day.</text>

            <text syncTime="551.311" offset="2311901">In fact, I think Flowers is supportive of our position here, on the statutory point, precisely because the Court thought to resolve Flower on the constitutional grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.011" offset="2354741">And there was no question there that it was covered by 1382, notwithstanding the fact that it is -- that it could be described as a public street, it was also property that was under the command of the commanding officer at Fort Sam Houston in that -- in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.878" offset="2418167">And so the Court went to the constitutional question.</text>

            <text syncTime="585.782" offset="2449827">But Flower does -- does strongly imply that coverage of 1382, which the Court would ordinarily address first before reaching the constitutional question, wasn't in doubt there, nor was it in doubt in any of the cases that this Court has decided under 1382, each of which has involved a military installation that is, to some greater or lesser extent, in some places or other, open to the public.</text>

            <text syncTime="1323.103" offset="5399156">But that's really a separate issue from what's presented here because that would control the application of the Assimilative Crimes Act, for example, but this statute -- this statute is not -- this statute is a freestanding Federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.846" offset="5462059">And I would say, in the example that you give, I think this -- it's worth talking for a moment about the situation, where the United States leases property and places it under military jurisdiction and gives it to a military command.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.810" offset="5513886">There certainly are such places, and that's why an ownership test isn't quite right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.183" offset="5535411">I think an ownership test, Justice Kagan, is sort of right about 95 percent of the time because it's usually true that the United States is going to want to own the places that it puts under military command, but it's not perfect in the leasing context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.178" offset="5591417">It's also -- it's also problematic in the situation that comes up in some of the courts of appeals cases regarding Coast Guard or naval security zones, which are designated waters adjacent to a base that are appurtenant to the commander's authority over the base, and those aren't kind of owned in -- in exactly the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.138" offset="5671248">But they're, nonetheless, under military command, and the courts of appeals had no difficulty seeing that they're covered.</text>

            <text syncTime="1401.525" offset="5712835">Yes, I think that's correct, too, because there are certainly property that the United States owns -- plenty of property -- most property that the United States owns isn't under military command.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.832" offset="5750033">And so it's not just Federal ownership, it's -- although I would -- I would point out that, with respect to these other statutes that deal with other agencies of the government that -- that administer lands, it is generally true -- I can't say that it's exclusively -- it's true across the board -- but it's generally true that there's a statute, something like this one, that corresponds to the regulatory authority of a land management agency.</text>

            <text syncTime="1471.389" offset="5992240">And so -- you know, when the California Department of Transportation road crew comes out to repave it or something, they need to know how -- how wide, how far are we supposed to go, so there is -- there's this green line.</text>

            <text syncTime="3271.792" offset="13193886">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.400" offset="13200260">Just a couple of points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.150" offset="13207261">I -- I think the colloquy with my friend sort of shows that taking this functional approach to where the statute applies day to day, place to place, is really just not going to prove workable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.771" offset="13257729">And we have to remember, this is a misdemeanor prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.597" offset="13265044">This is not something that should entail an extremely extensive subtle inquiry that is going to vary from place to place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.515" offset="13296808">So I think that that shows the wisdom of what the Court said in the Benson case, which we quote at page 15 and 16 of our reply brief, which explains.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.623" offset="13325230">It says that:</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.106" offset="13331081">"When a tract has been legally reserved for military purposes, courts follow the action of the political department of the government and will not inquire what the actual uses to which any portion of the reserve is temporarily put. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.257" offset="13379773">As for the Ninth Circuit's approach, which is this sort of real estate-based analysis, I think there have been a number of hypotheticals offered that show why that's going to produce some borderline absurd or entirely absurd results.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.562" offset="13452916">And so that's why we come back to again respecting the decision to place -- to place the installation under military command and that Section 1382 provides the sanction to enforce the orders entered pursuant to that lawful command.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.868" offset="13522193">I might say one word about the green line and its relevance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.163" offset="13535359">My friend says that it is sort of the threshold across which 1382 applies or doesn't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.161" offset="13571303">The relevance in a 1382 prosecution of the green line comes in a prosecution under the first paragraph for violating a regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.218" offset="13611532">At Joint Appendix 51, there's the commander's order closing the base, and what it says is:</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.497" offset="13644655">"Pursuant to my authority, Vandenberg Air Force Base is a closed base. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.293" offset="13663881">"General rule covering the entire command authority. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.761" offset="13669732">Paragraph 2:</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.056" offset="13674957">"The roadway easements through Vandenberg have limited use as provided. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.476" offset="13696586">et cetera, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.648" offset="13701288">"Use and occupation is for these purposes only and is subject to any rules and regulations the installation commander may prescribe. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.286" offset="13723858">and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.943" offset="13726470">So what the green line is, is it's defining the boundary between the closed base, the generally closed base, and the road, which is open.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.032" offset="13754787">So that is what ensures that someone who is driving on the road is not committing an offense against the commander's regulations, if they are just an ordinary member of the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.108" offset="13795120">And, of course, if they cross over the line, then they are violating the closed base regulation if they don't have the commander's permission to cross that line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.323" offset="13828035">So the -- what is different, of course, about Respondent is that he's been barred from the base.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.852" offset="13854052">So the rules that apply to the general public don't apply to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.587" offset="13865024">Of course that's the very purpose of the second paragraph of Section 1382, is to recognize that commanders can make individualized determinations that the rules that work generally for the public don't work for particular people who show themselves to be willing to vandalize government property or disobey the instructions to remain within the areas that they may lawfully be present in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.640" offset="13941301">And, of course, that's the basis for why Respondent was barred.</text>

            <text syncTime="3500.967" offset="14110575">But I think what the settlement does show is that if it's the commander who is authorizing this, the commander remains in charge of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.090" offset="14139101">And of course, the current protest policy which is reproduced in the Joint Appendix is quite clear that the commander retains authority to -- and can control the time and place of the protests, and of course makes it clear that people who are barred can't come back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.490" offset="14196675">So on that point, with respect to the constitutional avoidance argument, I think, as the Chief Justice pointed out, it needs to be a serious constitutional doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.082" offset="14231052">And I think what this Court has said in Virginia v. Hicks puts any of those doubts to rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.722" offset="14249546">The Court said in that case that the First Amendment permits, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.003" offset="14266683">"the punishment of a person who has, pursuant to lawful regulation, been banned from a public park. "</text>

            <text syncTime="3550.202" offset="14307538">"after vandalizing it and who ignores that ban in order to take part in a political demonstration. "</text>
