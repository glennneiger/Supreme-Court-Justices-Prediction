            <text syncTime="12.308" offset="155413">The standing trust for antitrust adopted by this Court 30 years ago in AGC is the appropriate test to give effect to Congress's intent under the Lanham Act, and this is for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.365" offset="211628">First, the plain text of the Lanham Act at Section 45 states that the intent of that Act is to protect commercial actors against unfair competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.856" offset="253529">Competition generally is the focus of both antitrust statutes and the Lanham Act, and any test that this Court adopts should be tied to that statutory intent section.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.064" offset="298355">Second, the history in the common law of both antitrust statutes and the Lanham Act are similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.551" offset="324373">In fact, in the Lanham Act context, the common law was more specific and more direct than it was under the antitrust statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.872" offset="353630">And finally, each of the five--</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="65.358" offset="367527">The Lanham Act goes well beyond the common law, doesn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="68.410" offset="379752">--The Lanham Act provides some causes of action that are beyond the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.898" offset="409741">We think the prudential standing considerations that were in place at common law or at least should guide the Court in determining what Congress intended to do by it.</text>

            <text syncTime="86.889" offset="453731">But that would be a lot stronger if -- if you said the Lanham Act merely, as the Sherman Act was supposed to have done, merely adopted the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.580" offset="500438">The Lanham Act doesn't merely adopt the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.116" offset="510574">It goes well beyond it.</text>

            <label>Mr. Steven B. Loy</label>
            <text syncTime="102.049" offset="514335">I think there are two components to the common law and -- and we'll -- and I'll talk now about the most general component, and that are considerations of proximate cause and foreseeability that were in place when the Sherman and Tate Acts were enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.958" offset="573999">Those are general propositions that apply to any, at least, Federal statutory cause of action and would also apply then to the Lanham Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.814" offset="609421">And the AGC factors address those prudential standing requirements about specifically asking about proximate cause factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.087" offset="642544">The very first question that AGC asks is: Is this the type of injury Congress intended to address?</text>
            <text syncTime="142.025" offset="674205">It's a logical question and should be asked appropriately in any Federal statutory cause of action.</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="150.446" offset="707955">Tell me why the answer to that question doesn't end this case here?</text>
            <text syncTime="155.266" offset="727181">You're disparaging the goods of a person.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.952" offset="741914">You're saying that it's illegal to use that person's products.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.641" offset="768663">It seems to me that's the essence of the Lanham Act as it's now written.</text>

            <text syncTime="175.080" offset="806489">First, we can talk about the -- the alleged false advertisements in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.449" offset="823938">The first alleged false advertisement by Lexmark was to Lexmark's customers saying that you're bound by this or use restriction on our cartridges.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.804" offset="861346">That advertisement does not mention Static Control at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.875" offset="873676">The second alleged false--</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="194.058" offset="882348">It doesn't mention what at all?</text>
            <text syncTime="195.243" offset="887155">It doesn't--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="steven_b_loy" startTime="195.927" stopTime="251.247">
            <label>Mr. Steven B. Loy</label>
            <text syncTime="195.927" offset="889871">--It does not mention Static Control at all, the Respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.279" offset="899276">The second alleged misrepresentation were letters written to remanufacturers saying to the remanufacturers, if you remanufacture -- remanufacture our cartridges, you will violate our rights, including if you use Static Control's products to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.139" offset="966671">Beyond that, though, the question of target is not a test.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.693" offset="984957">It's a conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.509" offset="988196">And in AGC, this Court, in the antitrust context, rejected a test for antitrust standing called the target area test.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.381" offset="1019648">In Conte Brothers, the Third Circuit decision that first adopted the AGC test in the Lanham Act also did not adopt a target area test.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.689" offset="1064892">And so for that reason, we think the factors that AGC lays out are the appropriate factors to determine antitrust standing in any given case.</text>

            <text syncTime="283.468" offset="1240017">And wherever the Court draws the line on standing, whoever is just on the other side of the line is always going to think that it's too narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.705" offset="1268960">Our cartridges, for instance, they do have microchips on them.</text>

            <text syncTime="298.311" offset="1299367">Those cartridges also have resin, they have labels, they have toner, they come in boxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.149" offset="1330714">If we allow one of many parts suppliers, like Static, in the remanufacturing industry to have standing--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="312.385" offset="1355687">Well, then you could -- you could sue them for infringing on your patent or whatever intellectual property protection you have.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.241" offset="1387138">But here is an entrepreneur that says, we make a product and Lexmark is disparaging our product.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.949" offset="1429979">It is essentially trying to get us out of this line of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.168" offset="1450773">Certainly, if you just read the words of the Lanham Act, this is allegedly false advertising, and the false advertiser shall be liable to any person who believes he or she is likely to be damaged by such an act.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.468" offset="1548053">That legislation seems to envision a very broad standing, certainly enough to encompass the person who is -- whose product is being disparaged.</text>

            <text syncTime="390.587" offset="1668529">The one difference -- the one difference is the Lanham Act, unlike the antitrust statutes, at Section 45 specifically states its intent as to protect commercial actors against unfair competition.</text>

            <label>Mr. Steven B. Loy</label>
            <text syncTime="3446.161" offset="13890805">I have three short points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.931" offset="13909822">The straightforward question for this Court is what test to apply for Lanham Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.983" offset="13930094">And we believe AGC is that test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.019" offset="13942214">On the facts of this case, we believe that the district court in analyzing these facts got it correct when it found that Static did not have standing under that test and when it found that Static was not a target, like the Sixth Circuit actually found that Static was not a target.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.344" offset="13995504">The second point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.463" offset="14003968">Through the entire briefing and at now oral argument, I -- I still have not heard, we have not heard how Static Control is conceptually any different than the union was in AGC.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.188" offset="14054854">And that just goes to show that target is not always the inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.592" offset="14076484">Third point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.758" offset="14081186">If this Court--</text>

            <text syncTime="3495.127" offset="14086619">I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.610" offset="14088605">You used target twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.977" offset="14094038">Once you said SCC was not a target and the another time you said it was, but it -- target isn't a test.</text>

            <text syncTime="3505.750" offset="14129147">--I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.852" offset="14133535">What I intended to say, and if I misspoke, I apologize, the district court found that the SCC lacked standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.154" offset="14154747">The district court found that SCC was not a target, although the Sixth Circuit decided that a different test should be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.825" offset="14185467">The Sixth Circuit also found that Static Control was not a target.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.627" offset="14200618">My final point is if this Court -- I'm sorry.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="3526.829" offset="14213470">Explain that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.265" offset="14215246">Because if we accept the allegation of the complaint as true, the allegation is that Static's product was disparaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.585" offset="14248474">That remanufacturers were told don't use this product because if you do, you're going to be involved in infringement.</text>

            <label>Mr. Steven B. Loy</label>
            <text syncTime="3545.643" offset="14288702">The -- Static Control's counterclaim never alleges target.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.546" offset="14312317">And it alleges, in fact, that the remanufacturers were the ones whose activities we were trying to -- to direct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.284" offset="14339276">If this Court were to adopt a zone of interest test, it would be the first time this Court has adopted that test outside the APA or APA-like context.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="3570.192" offset="14386923">Well, was Title VII an APA -- when I asked Mr. Jones?</text>

          <turn speaker="steven_b_loy" startTime="3576.329" stopTime="3617.323">
            <label>Mr. Steven B. Loy</label>
            <text syncTime="3576.329" offset="14411478">If Title -- no, it was not an APA, but the language for standing that the Court analyzed is party affected or aggrieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.035" offset="14450244">The Court then looked at the similarity of that language to the language in APA and there -- thereby justified using that test in that case with similar statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.842" offset="14493502">I think opposing counsel said they -- that under their zone of interest test, any person whose products or services are expressly or implicitly implicated should have standing under the Lanham Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.852" offset="14553584">We think that goes too far.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.121" offset="14562675">If there are no further questions.</text>
