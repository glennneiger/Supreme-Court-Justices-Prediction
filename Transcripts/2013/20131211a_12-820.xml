            <text syncTime="8.732" offset="141248">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.012" offset="162355">I represent Manuel Jose Lozano, a father who loves his daughter.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.775" offset="189417">Respondent kidnapped that daughter and concealed her from Mr. Lozano, first in the United Kingdom for nearly eight months; then in France, then in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.175" offset="231004">In Abbott, this Court recognized child abduction to be one of the worst forms of child abuse, and that the Convention therefore aims to deter and prevent child abduction from occurring in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.311" offset="283563">Equitable tolling furthers that aim.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.170" offset="294952">By contrast the rule adopted by the Second Circuit provides a playbook for thwarting the Convention.</text>

            <text syncTime="54.432" offset="324000">Mr. -- Mr. Regan, you -- you want us to apply equitable tolling in a field, family law, where the interest of the child is always of paramount importance and running all through family law is -- is that concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.437" offset="416056">And changed circumstances figure very large.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.248" offset="435282">So decrees that might be final in another area of law are not, because if circumstances change, then the child custody may change.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.073" offset="478541">So it seems to me that this area is hugely unfit for equitable tolling that would leave out consideration of the child's best interests.</text>

            <label>Ms. Shawn P.  Regan</label>
            <text syncTime="103.819" offset="521590">Justice Ginsburg, we believe that equitable tolling does provide, within the context of the Convention, consideration -- the opportunity for courts to consider the interests of the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.063" offset="578537">And that's most poignantly illustrated by some of the cases in which it has been applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.124" offset="602779">If I may provide an example.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.278" offset="611452">An example in Respondent's brief, Mendez Lynch v. Mendez Lynch on page 31 of their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.839" offset="641649">It's a case in which the Court found equitable tolling is available, and it found equitable tolling applied factually.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.790" offset="673414">The Court, however, considered the facts and circumstances of the child's life, including those facts and circumstances that relate to the extent to which the child is settled; but it considered those facts and circumstances within the rubric of the Article 13 analysis, and that is consistent with what other courts have done in what I would -- what I would term more natural Article 12--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="165.045" stopTime="186.583">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="165.045" offset="766515">Is that equitable discretion or is that still equitable tolling?</text>
            <text syncTime="167.076" offset="774560">Because as I understand equitable tolling, if it applies, and say, there's a 6-month suspension, the child must go back so that there's -- so that the -- that the weighing that you're talking about just doesn't -- doesn't come into play.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="shawn_p__regan" startTime="186.583" stopTime="246.686">
            <label>Ms. Shawn P.  Regan</label>
            <text syncTime="186.583" offset="852614">--Thank you, Justice Kennedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.818" offset="857525">And I think this is important because I think this -- this illustrates how foreign courts have miscomprehended equitable tolling, how it would operate, how it operates within the context of the convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.813" offset="905590">Equitable tolling would prevent the abducting parent from taking advantage of the Article 12-2 exception, that -- that the child should not be returned because the child is now -- because the parent has met that minimal routine showing of the child is now settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.103" offset="970688">He's going to school, he or she is -- has some friends, so on and so forth, that they are living a normal life here.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.570" offset="996601">What it does not prevent, and Mendez illustrates this, as do other cases, it does not prevent the court from looking at the Article 13 considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.331" offset="1035576">So for example, as in Mendez and other cases, the court will still consider if the child -- if the child is of sufficient age and maturity to testify such that this court should take into account his or her views or objections to return, the court can do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="328.341" offset="1419680">They're somewhat incommensurate or, you know, competing considerations or -- but both very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.541" offset="1444444">We think that equitable tolling properly balances them within the structure of the Convention because equitable tolling, again, it -- it prevents this Article 12-2 exception, but it doesn't prevent the Article 13 exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.714" offset="1497107">In fact, in many ways what we're talking about is not inconsistent with what the English court does or did in Cannon.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.930" offset="1526051">In Cannon, the court said if -- where there is concealment and subterfuge, there will be a heightened burden for establishing settlement.</text>

            <text syncTime="400.508" offset="1708281">Let me give you this example.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.101" offset="1714655">Suppose a child is abducted at -- at age one and is concealed for 10 years and then the location of the child is discovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.032" offset="1762407">The other parent files a petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.532" offset="1772438">So that if there's equitable tolling, the petition was filed within one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.436" offset="1792082">But during those 10 years, the child has become very well settled in the new country, has learned the language of that country, the customs developed, gone to school, developed relationships, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.510" offset="1832310">Under -- if there is no equitable tolling but the abduction can be taken into account under the doctrine of equitable discretion, that's -- that's one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.944" offset="1878077">But the way you read this, the way you read the Convention, the equitable tolling would mean that the petition was filed within a year, and unless one of the conditions in Article 13 was met, for example a grave risk that the child's return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation, then there would be -- then the child would have to be removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.997" offset="1978283">So there is that major difference, isn't there, between those two positions?</text>

            <text syncTime="473.368" offset="1999808">And we think that that significant difference is warranted and necessary in order to achieve the effect of deterrence, because the Second Circuit's rule essentially says to abducting parents: If you abduct your child and you conceal your child for 12 months, you will be rewarded.</text>

            <text syncTime="489.174" offset="2063024">The position of the Respondent and the government would give a great incentive for parents to abduct children and hide them for a period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.640" offset="2096879">But on the other side, as my example I think illustrates, your rule would mean that a child who is very well settled in a particular location would have to be returned to the other country for purposes of the custody determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="1454.155" offset="5922877">And you're right, they had other provisions that would affect the possible return or lack thereof, and they never wanted to stop a court from returning a child if it in its equitable discretion decided it was appropriate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1525.658" offset="6208970">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.172" offset="6219001">To reverse the Second Circuit's holding and to apply equitable tolling to Article 12 would be squarely at odds with the convention's task, purpose, and drafting history, as well as contrary to the post-ratification understanding and interpretation of every other signatory state to consider the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.197" offset="6291099">Your Honors, we ended on a note of drafting history, and to return to Justice Sotomayor's question about turning that a bit on its head, I agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.472" offset="6328193">The drafting history specifically shows that the countries considered two periods: One of prompt return, return forthwith within 6 months of the removal; and 6 months from the discovery of the whereabouts of the child if the child were not known.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.716" offset="6401127">And what the drafters thought -- some thought the period needed to be longer, but there were countries that wanted it to be shorter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.011" offset="6430384">There were countries that were very concerned that the child would become settled in the new environment such that uprooting that child again just for purposes of having a custody determination in the -- in the former country of habitual residence would be contrary to that child's interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.971" offset="6498198">So they struck a balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.331" offset="6503631">They -- they negotiated over -- over several drafts and finally arrived at a single period of one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.562" offset="6536546">But that wasn't going to be a cutoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.968" offset="6542188">Instead of having a statute of limitation, statute of proposed construct they said the obligation is going to continue and it's going to continue until the child turns 16, unless it is demonstrated that the child is now settled in her -- in its new environment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1645.953" offset="6690146">And that was the central purpose of the Convention, to prevent harm to children and also to parents, but centrally to children who are abducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.262" offset="6723373">And if you have a rule that says if can abduct the child and you can hide for a year, which isn't very difficult, then all you have to do is provide some evidence of settlement, and you are going to -- you are going to win, you are going to deter return.</text>

            <text syncTime="1692.371" offset="6875824">I wonder if you would accept that, that there is no equitable tolling, let's assume for the sake of argument, but abduction is a strong factor that weighs against the return, that weighs against the failure to return the child, not just something that can be disposed of in a sentence, which is basically what the district court did here, but a very strong factor that has to be taken into account in the exercise of equitable discretion.</text>
