            <text syncTime="10.689" offset="149361">The Board of Immigration Appeals reasonably interpreted Section 1153(h)(3) when it ruled that creation of a new petition by a new petitioner did not qualify as automatic conversion of an existing petition to an appropriate family-sponsored category.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.948" offset="210383">That interpretation is supported by the text and by the structure of the statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.852" offset="230027">Indeed, it avoids destabilizing that scheme by displacing waiting aliens who have long had qualifying relationships with lawful permanent residence, and putting ahead of them in line a large number of adults, aged-out former derivative beneficiaries, who have only just attained a relationship with someone who can sponsor a family member.</text>

            <text syncTime="102.782" offset="517688">First of all, the derivative's rights are, as the name suggests, completely derivative of the principal beneficiary's rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.370" offset="544019">If the principal beneficiary never becomes a lawful permanent resident, never crosses the border into this country, then the derivative gets nothing for the time that the principal beneficiary spent waiting in line.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.160" offset="587174">In addition, there are derivative beneficiaries who, under any understanding of what it means to wait in line, can't be conceived of as having waited -- excuse me -- for the time that the principal beneficiary has waited.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.968" offset="634403">And let me give you an example of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.735" offset="641508">In the (f)(4) line, someone could be waiting in the (f)(4) line as a principal beneficiary for, say, 15 years, and right as they're getting up to the front of that line--</text>

            <text syncTime="166.956" offset="774419">That stepchild, that 17-year-old child, under the definition of child in the statute, will count as the principal beneficiary's child.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.045" offset="802736">And if, say, a year later the principal beneficiary's priority date becomes current and that principal beneficiary is entitled to immigrate to the United States and become a lawful permanent resident, they're going to be able to bring that 17-year-old or at that point 18-year-old stepchild along with them as a derivative beneficiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.257" offset="871595">That stepchild did not wait in the line for the first 15 years that the principal beneficiary was waiting.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.578" offset="896881">And so that example, I think, shows why, when you look at a derivative beneficiary, you want to look at the end of the process; a snapshot in time of when the principal beneficiary is coming to this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.933" offset="938259">And what the statute says is, principal beneficiary, if at the moment you're coming, do you have a child who would be left behind in another country if you were to come without them, if so, bring them along.</text>

            <text syncTime="559.831" offset="2345946">So if I could turn back to Justice Sotomayor's question about why they wouldn't just go ahead and copy the language of the regulation into the statute and why they didn't just say F2A in the statute, I think the reason gets back to what I was discussing earlier actually with Justice Alito, which is that actually would have been overinclusive if they had just said F2A beneficiaries are covered, because there is a set of F2A derivative beneficiaries who don't benefit from the language of Section 1153(h)(3) because they are the child of the petitioner's spouse, but they don't count as the child of the petitioner, probably for a stepchild kind of situation like I was discussing earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.790" offset="2501740">If the stepchild is over 18 at the time of the marriage, they don't count as a stepparent's child under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.110" offset="2527027">So there is a tiny corner here that would get carved out.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.996" offset="2538521">And actually Congress did a very good job in this statute of capturing exactly the universe of people that was captured under the preexisting regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.334" offset="2571957">The preexisting regulation required there to be another petition filed by the same petitioner, and automatic conversion to the appropriate category gets at exactly that same kind of result.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.809" offset="2617828">The other reason I think why Congress might not have specified F2A in section 1153(h)(3) in addition to just its understanding of automatic conversion as a term of art in this area that was doing the work that it wanted, is that section 1153(h)(3) now functions smoothly if there's a change in the family-sponsored categories, which has happened in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.488" offset="2704555">Congress has changed up those categories, added categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.357" offset="2720019">And so if, for instance, Congress were now to add a category for grandchildren of U.S. citizens, then aged-out F3 beneficiaries like Respondent's sons and daughters, could automatically convert to an appropriate category and section 1153(h)(3) would work just fine.</text>

            <text syncTime="833.156" offset="3439223">This Court has said before that deference is particularly appropriate in immigration contexts, and I think if any immigration context is appropriate for it, it's this one, because very delicate lines have to be drawn here.</text>

            <text syncTime="849.184" offset="3503275">Otherwise there is going to be real destabilization of the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.053" offset="3518739">And just before I turn to that, let me just say one more thing about what Congress was thinking.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.021" offset="3534622">To the extent that you look at the legislative history here, there is no indication that Congress was thinking that this would sweep broadly.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.610" offset="3565028">In fact, there are many statements on the floor about not wanting to displace people who are waiting in line, which would cut in the other direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.031" offset="3590733">So the destabilization that would occur as a result of Respondent's interpretation would be many people -- and we can't quantify exactly how many, but we have reason to think that the number is quite large -- would come pouring into, in most cases, the very front of the F2B line and would hold it up for very significant periods of time and perhaps even freeze that line altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.713" offset="3677459">Keep in mind that in that line there are only 26,250 visas available per year -- nothing changes that -- and per country, there are only about 1800 visas available per year.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.835" offset="3721867">So if you envision, say, 3600 people from one country coming into the front of the F2B line, every single person in that line -- that's at least hundreds of thousands of people based on State Department numbers and more than that probably if you had the other numbers, is going to wait for two additional years.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.130" offset="3787069">And if there are more people who come into the front of the line, all those people are going to wait longer.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.416" offset="3800235">And the equities here are such that the people who are going to be pushed back really have entitlement to stay where they are, and that's for this reason: The people coming into the front of the line, the aged-out F3 and F4 derivative beneficiaries, have only just, just moments before this has happened, obtained some kind of qualifying relationship with the U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident that would entitle them to family-sponsored immigration.</text>

            <text syncTime="1119.928" offset="4586312">Keep in mind, they've never been checked at the beginning of this process when petitions are evaluated and approved to see if they qualify to be a petitioner.</text>

            <text syncTime="1132.753" offset="4637616">So if you have to stop and do that check at that stage as well, then it's starting to look a lot less automatic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.140" offset="4663112">Then there's a separate question, as I say, even if you did think that the statute could unambiguously be read to say that you can take a petition by someone's grandparent and make it into a petition by someone's parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.547" offset="4708774">There's a separate timing question that the parties are disputing here as well, and that the board ruled on in its decision in Wang, and that is, what is the moment when automatic conversion is supposed to take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.255" offset="4751614">Respondent's argument is that it's supposed to take place at whatever time the derivative beneficiary is interviewed, essentially at the very end of the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.628" offset="4789126">A consular interview or an adjustment of status interview or evaluation, and that that's when automatic conversion ought to happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.615" offset="4817025">But what the board said, and I think quite recently, is something different, which is, the statute gives you a date, Section 1153(h)(1) gives you a date as of which you are supposed to evaluate the derivative beneficiary's age, and that's the date that the visa number becomes available to a parent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1214.557" offset="4964774">I think, as I read Wang in any event, that it says on page 33 you get automatic conversion if the beneficiary is 21 years or older pursuant to (h)(1), and then later in the decision on page 35, it talks about the moment the beneficiary aged out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.964" offset="5022452">But that I take it to be referring back to the (h)(1) determination that's been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.101" offset="5038961">So it's aged out not biologically in the sense of turning 21 and celebrating your 21st birthday, but becoming 21 -- over 21 -- 21 or over under (h)(1) as of that date that the visa number becomes available to the parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.259" offset="5091624">I think that's how Wang is best interpreted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.813" offset="5105835">There may be separate questions about whether people are entitled to the protections of (h)(1), but those aren't being raised in this case, and that's not something that Wang itself ruled on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.502" offset="5148571">And so I do think that there's a reasonable reading of the statute that says, getting back to the question of automatically, the moment, the key moment is the moment that you're evaluating derivative beneficiary's age as of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.826" offset="5197890">And as of that date, they're either under 21 and they can be treated as a child for the rest of the process, or they're 21 or over, and you got to figure out what can you do with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.999" offset="5234566">Can they be automatically converted to an appropriate category or can they not?</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.819" offset="5249822">And if not, then they're out of luck.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.271" offset="5259644">And that is a way of reading the statute that makes it a very smooth movement from one category to another without any kind of gap in eligibility.</text>

            <text syncTime="1340.638" offset="5469146">And so the question would be, if that problem, which subtracts all the days that there was a processing delay, is taken care of on (1)(b), they can't be right that that was the purpose of 3.</text>

            <text syncTime="1385.768" offset="5649600">With respect to the reasoning on the legislative history, the way that I read the board decision is totally consistent with my own reading of legislative history, which is to say that Congress's overwhelming concern and the thing that Congress talked about by far the most in the fairly sparse legislative history here, there's no pertinent report really, there are just a couple of days of debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.663" offset="5725250">And the thing that Congress talked about the most was the administrative delays.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.698" offset="5741342">That was Congress's overarching concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.134" offset="5751059">And Congress didn't really talk about (h)(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.086" offset="5758896">They didn't really say what they were doing there.</text>

            <text syncTime="1416.304" offset="5771748">And so I think under those circumstances, the board is reasonable in saying it makes sense to think that what Congress was doing was not some kind of big change and destabilization of the whole immigrant visa system in the way that I described earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.313" offset="5831830">It was doing something pretty small.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark C. Fleming</label>
            <text syncTime="1544.071" offset="6282808">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.588" offset="6292943">The government began at Step 2 of Chevron, but I would submit that this case can and should be resolved at Step 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.944" offset="6322305">The government is asking this Court to read the statute in a highly disfavored way such that it is not harmonious but at war with itself, and nothing in the language requires that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.300" offset="6363787">In fact, I would recommend that the Court turn to the back page of the government's brief where the statute is actually set forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.288" offset="6387716">And we can see that provision (h)(3) consists of one sentence, and that sentence consists of two parts separated by a comma.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.477" offset="6424496">Before the comma, the language sets forth one and only one eligibility criterion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.648" offset="6449156">After the comma, the language sets forth two things that shall be done if the eligibility criterion is satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.051" offset="6474756">Now, importantly, the government does not contend that there is any ambiguity in the language before the comma.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.057" offset="6498788">Everyone agrees that it contemplates and includes all derivative beneficiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.961" offset="6522403">There's no dispute about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.261" offset="6527627">And a bedrock rule at the Step 1 inquiry is that the Court reads the statute as a harmonious whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.948" offset="6554377">That goes double when we're talking about a single sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.083" offset="6566916">So if there is a possible reading of this sentence that is harmonious with the clear opening clause that applies to all derivative beneficiaries under Step 1 of Chevron, that is the reading the Court gives to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.375" offset="6612055">It's especially important here because the precise question at issue in this case is a question of eligibility and scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.813" offset="6641835">Who gets the benefit of the two benefits set forth, the two duties set forth by the shalls in the language after the comma.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.884" offset="6674122">And Congress spoke to that directly in the language before the comma.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.038" offset="6690736">All derivative beneficiaries who have gone through the (h)(1) formula and whose age is determined to be over 21.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.858" offset="6714037">Now, the government's claim of ambiguity here depends on asking the Court to read one of the benefits after the comma, automatic conversion, in such a narrow and limited way, a way not required by the plain language, a way that even the BIA actually did not adopt, but such that it is incompatible with the broad scope set forth before the comma.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.121" offset="6795017">The Court should be very suspicious of that reading, because it is exactly the contrary of the traditional tool of statutory construction going back to Brown &amp; Williamson and FTC v. Mandel that says the Court reads a statute holistically as a harmonious whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.679" offset="6849247">For the government's argument to work, the Court would have to be satisfied that we were in a situation like National Association of Home Builders v. Defenders of Wildlife, which is the only case that they cite for their ambiguity claim, but there the court faced two different statutes and acted at different times that were clearly contradictory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.641" offset="6921136">You could not comply with both of them at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.243" offset="6931585">You had to pick one or other the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.361" offset="6935974">And in that context, this Court said that opens the door to agency interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.163" offset="6955200">So in order for the--</text>

            <text syncTime="1998.733" offset="8101557">Because they both go in at the same time, parent and child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.118" offset="8115036">The officer always adjudicates the principal beneficiary's file first.</text>

            <text syncTime="3314.690" offset="13365335">Even the government's theory of (h)(3) means that some people are going to go out of the F2A category into the F2B category.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.094" offset="13394906">And so the question is, under Chevron Step 2, which again, we don't think the Court needs to address, has the BIA drawn a rational line here within this group of beneficiaries who are all F2B, all children of lawful permanent residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.704" offset="13453420">And the line the BIA drew is it says we are going to say treat better people who have two lawful permanent resident parents than people who have one lawful permanent resident parent, often two, and a U.S. citizen relative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.130" offset="13511098">Is there a rational line for that?</text>

            <text syncTime="3394.142" offset="13683193">That's not true under respondents' own reading, and it can't be true because there are going to be situations where someone has their age calculated as over 21 as of the date the visa becomes available to the parent, and the parent never becomes a lawful permanent resident.</text>

            <text syncTime="3507.565" offset="14136783">And the implication of Respondents' argument is, as I think Justice Scalia recognized in his question, that somebody can get a priority date and just walk around with it, even if there is no valid petition pending as to them and even if their parent never becomes a lawful permanent resident.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.611" offset="14201045">So that would mean that aged-out derivative beneficiaries, under Respondents' interpretation, would be better off than children whose parents never become a lawful permanent resident.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.217" offset="14239392">They would have a priority date somehow in their pocket that they could walk around with and use 20 years later when somebody filed a different petition on their behalf, an employment petition--</text>

            <text syncTime="3541.489" offset="14272516">Well, it's not so odd to say they've got a priority date in their pocket when the statute says the original priority date -- they'll retain the original priority date.</text>
