            <text syncTime="3394.398" offset="13683490">I think that with, regard to Your Honor's points about issues being waived or forfeited below, the only issue that even arguably, even arguably was operated below was the discrete question as to whether Mercedes Benz itself is subject to general jurisdiction in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.439" offset="13743676">The question that Justice Kagan and others were inquiring about, namely that even were one to accept the attribution theory and evaluate Daimler as a joint enterprise, would that render the combined enterprise at home in California, we plainly did not waive or forfeit that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.932" offset="13805638">In fact we expressly addressed it in our opening brief and we have been fighting in this case from day one to argue that, even if you were to attribute the contacts, there is no basis for jurisdiction over Daimler.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.115" offset="13854435">That question is squarely presented for this Court's review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.879" offset="13869481">I also think that, as Justice Ginsburg and others have noted, there has been some confusion in the lower courts over the distinction between specific jurisdiction and general jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.845" offset="13909292">This Court saw it in Goodyear, for example, and I think that were this Court to resolve this case on the ground that Justice Kagan suggested or Justice Alito suggested, namely, that a corporation cannot be at home outside of the areas where it maintains its principal place of business or is incorporated, that it can't be subject to general jurisdiction anywhere else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.561" offset="13988182">That would be a clean rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.217" offset="13994765">It would be a workable rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.795" offset="14001139">I think it's fully consistent with what the Court said in Goodyear, and it would provide clarity and guidance to the lower courts and eliminate the circuit split that currently exists over agency jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.088" offset="14038232">A couple other quick points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.916" offset="14045547">Justice Scalia, I regret to report that neither the parties nor the courts below reproduced the text of the California statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.820" offset="14069161">The Solicitor General, however, to his credit did on page 4 of his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.678" offset="14084626">It simply says that California may exercise jurisdiction on any basis not inconsistent with the Constitution of California or the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.269" offset="14115032">And the Ninth Circuit panel on page 19A of the Petitioner's appendix said that, therefore, the question is this case -- in this case is simply whether the exercise of jurisdiction would exceed the permissible bounds of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.124" offset="14166441">The last point I want to make, and we've been discussing legal issues, is just to remind the Court of the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.700" offset="14192773">This is a case involving Argentine plaintiffs suing a German corporation based on events that allegedly occurred in Argentina more than 30 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.337">This case has no connection to the United States, and it has no business in a California courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.006">The Ninth Circuit's contrary conclusion is indefensible, and for that reason, we ask that the judgment be reversed.</text>
