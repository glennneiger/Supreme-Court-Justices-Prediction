            <text syncTime="33.144" offset="237734">The short answer to the question is all losses must be proximately caused.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.719" offset="264065">Eleven courts of appeals and the government agree that this circuit ignored the plain text of the statute and the enumerated enforcement provisions of 3664 to craft a restitution scheme where the possession of two images of child pornography resulted in the award of $3.4 million to Doyle Paroline which was strictly, jointly and severally liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.285" offset="378377">And my time before the Court was to address first why the Fifth Circuit decision is incorrect, and second, why the government's concept of aggregate causation conflicts with its statutory burden of proof contained in 3664(e).</text>

            <text syncTime="3521.624" offset="14191719">But if -- but you're looking at what a single judge has to sentence someone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.622" offset="14211677">A single judge, like Judge Davis, had one defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.933" offset="14224947">He didn't have a defendant in Florida or Maine or Oregon to see what that person's background was.</text>

            <text syncTime="3542.850" offset="14276565">And in this case, the district court balanced two experts and the methodology that was challenged and simply said, I find she was a victim.</text>

            <text syncTime="3557.812" offset="14336438">But the government didn't meet its statutory burden of proof in this case, and in many other cases there is losses proved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.169" offset="14373845">And there's a difference between harm and loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.651" offset="14383772">In this case, the district court did exactly what the government wanted them to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.899" offset="14408745">Weigh the evidence, listen to the evidence, look at the defendant and see if the government met its burden.</text>
