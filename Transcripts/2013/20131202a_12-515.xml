            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106071">We will hear argument first this morning in Case 12-515, Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.420" offset="131671">Mr. Bursch.</text>

            <label>Mr. John J. Bursch</label>
            <text syncTime="7.904" offset="137627">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="10.722" offset="148912">After Bay Mills' concession on the first question presented, the only issue is whether Bay Mills enjoys blanket immunity from suit when it engages in illegal, off-reservation, commercial conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.196" offset="198753">And the answer is no for at least two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.798" offset="209202">First, it makes no sense that Congress intended States to have a Federal injunctive remedy for illegal gaming on reservation, but no injunctive remedy if that gaming takes place on land that is subject to the State's exclusive jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.908" offset="265627">Second, a tribe should not have greater immunity than foreign nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.712" offset="284853">There's no dispute that if France opened up an illegal business in Michigan, casino or otherwise, it would have no blanket immunity.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="51.116" offset="310453">Counsel, before you go on, could you address the jurisdiction question for me?</text>
            <text syncTime="55.501" offset="328007">I'm not sure why you're here.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.620" offset="340546">The only injunction that I see was entered on behalf of Little -- Little Traverse's and not on behalf of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.894" offset="377640">And so, the counts that you're arguing about were added after the injunction was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.748" offset="408987">How do you have jurisdiction to act -- to argue someone else's injunction?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_j_bursch" startTime="82.235" stopTime="104.483">
            <label>Mr. John J. Bursch</label>
            <text syncTime="82.235" offset="435005">That's not quite correct, Justice Sotomayor.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.437" offset="443782">Originally, this case was filed as two separate lawsuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.389" offset="455589">Michigan was a plaintiff, and then the other tribe was a plaintiff in the separate case.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.174" offset="470740">Those cases were consolidated and then when the motion for injunction was filed, Michigan joined in that motion, filed a brief supporting it and everyone proceeded under the assumption that both the tribe and the State were asking for the injunction.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="104.483" stopTime="130.135">
            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="104.483" offset="523926">That, in fact, is not what the district court said.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.452" offset="531867">The district court explicitly said in its order granting the injunction that the State hadn't filed an injunction, hadn't intervened and had only filed supporting papers in support of Little Traverse's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.945" offset="593829">I'm a little -- I'm very, very confused as I looked at what the district court said.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.681" offset="612742">It explicitly said you weren't part of the order.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_j_bursch" startTime="130.135" stopTime="133.603">
            <label>Mr. John J. Bursch</label>
            <text syncTime="130.135" offset="626535">Well, again, they were consolidated cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.318" offset="635312">We were supporting the injunction--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="133.603" stopTime="148.179">
            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="133.603" offset="640432">I think “ consolidated ” can have two meanings and -- and -- to be heard together or to be joined together.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.025" offset="674078">I don't think the district court understood that this was going to be joined together.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.010" offset="694035">Why did it say what it did?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_j_bursch" startTime="148.179" stopTime="159.654">
            <label>Mr. John J. Bursch</label>
            <text syncTime="148.179" offset="698737">--Well, I think it was everybody's understanding that these were joined together because the parties were pursuing the exact same issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.683" offset="724755">And so then once this went up to the Sixth Circuit, there was no question in the Sixth Circuit's mind--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="159.654" stopTime="167.341">
            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="159.654" offset="744608">So why didn't you file an injunction -- why does your brief say that you filed it only in support of Little Traverse and not on your own behalf?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_j_bursch" startTime="167.341" stopTime="183.852">
            <label>Mr. John J. Bursch</label>
            <text syncTime="167.341" offset="775433">--Because once the cases were consolidated, and at that point we were even using the same docket entries, there was already a motion on file.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.330" offset="803331">So there was no need to have a second motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.530" offset="812109">It was clear to everyone that the State of Michigan and the tribe were both pursuing that injunctive relief together.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.001" offset="834051">And that's exactly the way the Sixth Circuit treated it.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="183.852" stopTime="192.225">
            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="183.852" offset="841470">I'll ask -- I'll ask your opposition, but I don't see why the district court would have made the point it did if it believed that it was dealing with both of you as parties.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_j_bursch" startTime="192.225" stopTime="205.633">
            <label>Mr. John J. Bursch</label>
            <text syncTime="192.225" offset="874907">Well, everyone has proceeded up the chain, including in the Sixth Circuit opinion, on the assumption that it was consolidated, that Michigan was requesting an injunction and, in fact, that kind of a procedural objection has never been raised by anybody, certainly not at the petition stage.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="205.633" stopTime="211.037">
            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="205.633" offset="928510">No, but we have to -- we have to, if we're not sure, raise any jurisdictional issue.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_j_bursch" startTime="211.037" stopTime="214.905">
            <label>Mr. John J. Bursch</label>

            <text syncTime="211.520" offset="952125">But I think it was eminently clear to the Sixth Circuit, if you read its opinion--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="214.905" stopTime="218.191">
            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="214.905" offset="965604">Well, it wasn't eminently clear to the district court who entered the order.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="218.191" stopTime="221.911">
            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="218.191" offset="978770">Is that a jurisdictional objection or a procedural one?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_j_bursch" startTime="221.911" stopTime="236.002">
            <label>Mr. John J. Bursch</label>
            <text syncTime="221.911" offset="993712">--Your Honor, it's a procedural objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.295" offset="999250">The only jurisdictional question in this case is whether there's Federal question jurisdiction under 1331, which has been conceded and the United States agrees to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.166" offset="1030701">And so I'm not going to spend my time on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.700" offset="1036866">Where I would like to spend my time is on the scope of tribal immunity.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="236.002" stopTime="255.382">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="236.002" offset="1050032">Before you do that, can you tell -- tell us why Michigan didn't resort to the dispute resolution means that the compact provided?</text>
            <text syncTime="248.128" offset="1098515">The compact said if there's a dispute it'll be decided by arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.864" offset="1117428">Michigan bypassed that.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_j_bursch" startTime="255.382" stopTime="283.216">
            <label>Mr. John J. Bursch</label>
            <text syncTime="255.382" offset="1127563">That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.184" offset="1142714">And there were two reasons for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.703" offset="1148879">The first is that that provision was only discretionary, as we explain in our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.172" offset="1166747">But even more important, the compact also makes clear that the tribe did not waive its sovereign immunity for purposes of arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.760" offset="1197049">So if we had gone to arbitration and prevailed, if the arbitrator had reached the same result as the Federal government did as to the status of these lands being not Indian lands, then--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="283.216" stopTime="302.127">
            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="283.216" offset="1238845">I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.599" offset="1240412">Could you explain that?</text>
            <text syncTime="284.366" offset="1243442">Because I thought that the purpose -- that the whole point of the C&amp;L Enterprises case is to say that when a tribe agrees to arbitration, it has waived its sovereign immunity for that purpose in that proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.408" offset="1299658">Are you saying that there was something special in this agreement?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_j_bursch" startTime="302.127" stopTime="341.920">
            <label>Mr. John J. Bursch</label>
            <text syncTime="302.127" offset="1314495">--I am, Justice Kagan, and I'm glad you brought up C&amp;L, because there you had a construction contract where there was invocation of an arbitration remedy and it didn't specifically preserve tribal immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.551" offset="1352216">Here we have the exact opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.068" offset="1358277">In the same paragraph 7 of the compact where we have the arbitration provision, the tribe and the State agree that, notwithstanding the arbitration provision, both parties' sovereign immunity is not waived and that it's -- it's preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.745" offset="1413029">So if we took a successful arbitration judgment and then tried to reduce that to a Federal judgment in court, they would have asserted immunity and we would be in the exact same procedural posture that we are right now, talking about the scope of tribal immunity involving illegal off-reservation gaming.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="341.920" stopTime="353.128">
            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="341.920" offset="1473738">Why -- why did -- along the same lines, why did you assert sovereign immunity as a defense when the tribe brought a declaratory judgment action concerning the status of those lands?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_j_bursch" startTime="353.128" stopTime="374.742">
            <label>Mr. John J. Bursch</label>
            <text syncTime="353.128" offset="1518564">Because, again, it wouldn't have done any good for us to stipulate to jurisdiction on the tribe's claim about the status of the lands, because simply having a declaratory judgment wouldn't have given us any relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.001" offset="1558061">We would have had to file a counterclaim for injunctive relief and the tribe, undoubtedly, would have filed or I would have asserted a tribal immunity there as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.024" offset="1590140">So really, all roads lead to tribal immunity no matter how--</text>

            <text syncTime="1301.774" offset="5313111">And so you can say, well, you know, that would be less intrusive than all these other things, bringing Ex Parte Young suits, arresting people, just, you know, conditioning the -- a license, stopping the casino from operating.</text>

            <text syncTime="1340.499" offset="5467965">And the change we're asking for here is not as big as the tribe makes it seem, because in IGRA, Section 2710, we have the ability to get an injunction to stop illegal gaming taking place on reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.057" offset="5518224">And so it's really not that big a leap to say if they're engaging in illegal gaming off reservation, likewise there, we should be able to get the least intrusive remedy, the one that is most respectful of the tribe's sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.679" offset="5560752">And frankly, we're kind of surprised that the United States would take the position that we're better off going in and arresting or suing individual officers, because that's not the way sovereigns are supposed to interact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.871" offset="5597532">And it would be a big deal if France opened up a casino in Michigan and rather than seeking a civil injunction, we tried to arrest the French president and throw them in a Michigan County jail.</text>

            <text syncTime="1415.548" offset="5768164">If any other entity, foreign nation, another State, an individual, set up an illegal business, whether it's prostitution, underage drinking, gaming, you name it, we would have the full panoply of State civil and criminal regulatory remedies available to us and could pick the most appropriate one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.409" offset="5835664">And somehow because this is a tribe, even though they are operating on Michigan's land where we have exclusive regulatory jurisdiction, somehow all those remedies are circumscribed to imperfect remedies like Ex parte Young, which may or may not be successful, or arresting our own citizens, and that's not respecting the constitutional sovereign that Michigan represents in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.756" offset="5917062">And to get back to a question a number of you had about the implications of this aside from gaming, this happens in all kinds of other contexts off reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.594" offset="5952380">You just had a case in 2011 involving the Oneida tribe in New York where they failed to pay their property taxes in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.615" offset="5980487">So the State moved in to foreclose for nonpayment of taxes those off-reservation properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.252" offset="6003057">And the Second Circuit, interpreting Kiowa, reluctantly concluded that the State did not have ability to enforce by foreclosing on that property because the tribe had immunity and invited this Court to review Kiowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.894" offset="6053630">This Court granted cert. Eventually cert was dismissed because the tribe waived immunity and they were able to go forward and pursue that remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.750" offset="6084977">But whether it's in the tax context, whether it's the gaming context, whether it's the criminal context -- you know, the amici briefs of Oklahoma and Alabama are replete with the issues that they are having as sovereigns in running up against the tribal sovereign immunity when it comes to these contexts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.775" offset="6149134">If there are no further questions, I will reserve the balance of my time.</text>

            <text syncTime="2747.217" offset="11094845">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.217" offset="11102891">I would like to respond at the outset to the suggestion that this Court might modify the categorical rule in Kiowa that an Indian tribe is subject to suit only if Congress unequivocally consents in order to allow suits by States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.094" offset="11162345">First of all, both Puyallup and Pottawatomi were suits by States for prospective injunctive relief and the Court found them barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.850" offset="11197454">Puyallup was off reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.369" offset="11203514">But there's another point that I think ties in with the questions about foreign sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.605" offset="11224412">In this Court's decision in Blatchford, the Court held that the State of Alaska could not be sued by an Indian tribe complaining about the distribution of some State funds in Alaska, which does not have Indian country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.448" offset="11287838">The Court held that the suit was barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.317" offset="11299331">In doing so, the Court recognized that the Eleventh Amendment had originally been understood to bar suits only by individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.990" offset="11329947">But relying on this Court's decision in Principality of Monaco, the Court said that the 11th Amendment also barred suits by foreign sovereigns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.612" offset="11368504">And the Court's rationale in Principality of Monaco was that foreign sovereigns were not parties to the convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.784" offset="11401104">There was no reciprocal abrogation of immunity between foreign sovereigns and States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.953" offset="11421793">And, in fact, the Court specifically pointed out that the State of Mississippi could not sue Monaco, and in this case Monaco could not sue Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.209" offset="11454812">The Court applied that very same reasoning in Blatchford to an Indian tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.163" offset="11470695">The Court said: We have held in the past that Indian tribes may not be sued, and they cited Puyallup, which was a suit by a State, and the Court said: Logically it follows that a tribe may not sue a State.</text>

            <text syncTime="3373.740" offset="13600928">I want to clarify just two things about Court's precedent and then get back to the remedies issue, which has taken up so much of our time this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.227" offset="13626946">First, the state of the law when IGRA was adopted in 1988; again, that was before Kiowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.464" offset="13651919">I heard my friend on the other side talk about Puyallup and how that was an off-reservation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.118" offset="13670518">And what you need to understand was that Puyallup was the third in a series of three opinions that this Court issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.420" offset="13691730">And it's true that some of the earlier cases involved on and off-reservation conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.891" offset="13709598">But as we point out in our reply brief -- this is at pages 167 to 68 of that opinion -- here the tribe's contention was that the fishing activities on its reservation were immune.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.765" offset="13753065">And Justice Stevens wrote that opinion, and then only a few short years later in Kiowa wrote his dissent where he said we've never before drawn that on/off-reservation distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.970" offset="13789950">So that's what Puyallup says.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.070" offset="13798309">With respect to Alfred Dunhill and the evolution of foreign sovereign immunity as a common law doctrine, four Justices agreed or signed on to the entire opinion where that discussion was held.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.362" offset="13839478">One Justice agreed only with parts one and two, but part two, on page 694, draws the commercial line and says the problem here is that the district court found the only evidence of an active state, as opposed to a commercial act, was a statement by counsel that the Cuban government and the intervenors denied liability and that's not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.407" offset="13911681">And -- and the Court did reference the Tate letter, but that's not why the Court changed the common law of foreign nation sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.494" offset="13939998">It -- it gave respectful consideration to the Executive Branch's views, and then it reached its own conclusion about what the common law should say.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.983" offset="13965911">And, Justice Ginsburg, you are exactly right to say if it makes sense in the foreign nation context and it makes sense here, apply it to both.</text>

            <text syncTime="3692.462" offset="14875913">But the reason why we think that you should go farther than that is because if sovereignty means anything, it means allowing people to define what is illegal on their own lands, whether it's prostitution, gaming or underage drinking, and being able to use the full enforcement power of the sovereign State, civil and criminal, to enforce those laws.</text>
