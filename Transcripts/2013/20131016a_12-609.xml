            <text syncTime="10.543" offset="149099">Once the Respondent made the trial decision to make his mental status an issue and then supported his argument by introducing as evidence the testimony of a mental health expert who had examined the Defendant, he no longer could properly claim the protection of the Fifth Amendment to avoid like kind rebuttal by another court-appointed expert.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.564" offset="241155">When the Kansas Supreme Court allowed the Respondent to do just that, it committed constitutional error and should be reversed for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.796" offset="282115">First, this Court's cases point to the opposite conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.762" offset="301968">Second, allowing this mental or mental expert rebuttal is consistent with this Court's precedent with the purposes of the Fifth Amendment and it is fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.305" offset="344182">And third, a holding that is consistent with the Kansas Supreme Court's rule would have the effect of undermining the truth-seeking function of the trial by excluding relevant evidence from the jury, especially in the mental health context where the jury has to make an assessment based upon--</text>

            <text syncTime="92.307" offset="476152">We're asking for a rule of parity that allows that once the defendant has opened the door by putting his own expert on, the government may respond in kind.</text>

            <text syncTime="102.397" offset="516486">I mean, that makes your case easier, but it seems to me that the defendant puts his mental capacity in issue and then testifies himself, but with no expert, the State can still call its own expert so far as the -- so far as the Federal constitution is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.656" offset="577612">There might be some Kansas rules about it.</text>

            <text syncTime="152.689" offset="717733">That's what we believe is appropriate here in terms of the parity rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="161.701" offset="753782">If I could just make -- it seems to me that it's not necessary to make our decision depend on whether or not another expert has been called.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.024" offset="791085">That makes your case easier.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.306" offset="796205">And sometimes when we write opinions, we take the easiest route.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.632" offset="809475">But I take it under your theory, even if the Defendant had not called his own expert, we would still have the same issue before the Court and you would take the position that a prosecution expert can testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.750" offset="873945">Now, whether or not he can use the previous statement, that's -- that's the second point.</text>

            <text syncTime="197.748" offset="897978">And, Your Honor, the -- the hypothetical Your Honor posits is closely related to the second question Kansas presented, which was not granted in this case, which would be the impeachment use once the Defendant himself has testified.</text>

            <text syncTime="220.380" offset="988466">Do I understand correctly, General Schmidt, that if there had never been a Federal proceeding, if this case had proceeded from start to finish in the Kansas courts, there would have been no Welner evidence, there would have been no prosecution expert, because it wouldn't have been allowed under Kansas's own rules?</text>

            <label>Mr. Derek Schmidt</label>
            <text syncTime="246.245" offset="1091911">Your Honor, Kansas law makes the distinction between voluntary intoxication as a defense and mental disease or defect as a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.334" offset="1120228">And it does provide a mechanism under the mental disease pleadings for the obtaining of a court-ordered mental evaluation, not under the other.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="260.160" offset="1147604">This -- this case was voluntary intoxication and -- and under Kansas procedure, the -- the prosecution could not have called a witness absent insanity or a mental disease; is that right?</text>

          <turn speaker="derek_schmidt" startTime="277.872" stopTime="303.237">
            <label>Mr. Derek Schmidt</label>
            <text syncTime="277.872" offset="1218448">Justice Ginsburg, it is correct that Kansas could not have called a witness under a voluntary intoxication defense -- could not have obtained a court-ordered mental evaluation.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.165" offset="1247601">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.009" offset="1250944">The reason I didn't merely say yes is we do have some disagreement with the other side that would be dealt with in the courts below as to whether this truly was a voluntary intoxication defense, since the other side's expert did put the long-term effects on the Defendant's mental capacity into issue based on his methamphetamine use.</text>

            <text syncTime="303.237" offset="1319908">General Schmidt, am I wrong to think that the issue in this case is whether there was compulsion at the time when the statement was made to the -- the court-ordered expert?</text>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="319.059" offset="1383124">That's the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.668" offset="1385632">It's not -- it wouldn't be a question of whether there was a violation of the Fifth Amendment privilege at the time when the statements were later introduced in the Kansas trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.382" offset="1424502">Isn't it very well settled in this Court's precedents that the introduction of statements obtained -- that the introduction of statements at a trial is not -- does not implicate the Fifth Amendment privilege?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="derek_schmidt" startTime="343.689" stopTime="372.365">
            <label>Mr. Derek Schmidt</label>
            <text syncTime="343.689" offset="1481658">--Well, Your Honor, the -- the compulsion question is a threshold question.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.984" offset="1498899">And to the extent this Court has recognized, for example, in cases like Ventris, that there are truly compelled statements in a Portash or Mincey sort of circumstance, that threshold issue would resolve it.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.622" offset="1541426">This is not that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.027" offset="1547068">In fact, any compulsion that might be involved here is much closer to what happens when a defendant makes a trial decision to offer himself as a witness and go on the stand, and then, as a matter of operation of law, must subject himself to cross-examination.</text>

            <text syncTime="372.365" offset="1596388">Well, that's the issue, as I see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.724" offset="1601821">But maybe I'm wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.099" offset="1603284">Correct me if I'm wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.099" offset="1607359">And maybe Mr. Katyal will.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.020" offset="1614987">That the issue is whether there was unconstitutional compulsion at the time when the statements were obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.408" offset="1636616">But I thought it was very well settled that if there -- there wasn't compulsion at that time, then the later introduction of the statements into the -- into evidence at the trial does not implicate the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>

            <label>Mr. Derek Schmidt</label>

            <text syncTime="403.369" offset="1720417">This is -- everything that -- everything important here was done under Rule 12.2 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and that's -- and that's the issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="417.255" offset="1776006">Even if it doesn't settle the matter, we think there was then subsequently a waiver at the time the evidence was introduced in the State's trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="430.186" offset="1827728">Kansas may have some rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.780" offset="1830027">Maybe the judges say I'm not going to hear this, this -- this is a State rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.201" offset="1847790">But insofar as the -- the Federal constitution is concerned, why doesn't that settle it?</text>

            <text syncTime="440.933" offset="1870673">There is some dispute between the parties on whether there is a sort of category of compulsion, called something else perhaps, which doesn't rise to the Portash-Mincey constitutional bar standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.646" offset="1913514">For example, the Respondent has argued that, although this may not be like Portash and Mincey, there is still nonetheless some inappropriate burden upon the choice that was made and that that is somehow constitutionally suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.470" offset="1960848">So I'm merely trying not to concede the ground that even if -- and I agree with you -- there was not constitutionally barred compulsion here, still, there is a way for Kansas to prevail in the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="994.214" offset="4083767">When a defendant puts his mental state at issue through the testimony of an expert who's examined him, the State may rebut that testimony with its own expert who examined the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.648" offset="4121488">The Fifth Amendment does not allow a defendant to put on his side of the story and then deprive the prosecution of any meaningful chance to respond.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.020" offset="4146983">And we think the close analogy here is the situation where a defendant himself takes the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.299" offset="4168090">To the extent that the question -- the Court has questions about scope of the government's ability to respond, we think that those are answered, like the General said, by the questions about when the defendant takes the stand reasonably related to the subject matter that the defense put on.</text>

            <text syncTime="1037.743" offset="4257952">The Court's cases -- Estelle, Buchanan, Powell -- have addressed an expert-for-expert situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.179" offset="4279686">And the specific rationale there is that this mental health opinion testimony is different in that you really can't have an expert give an opinion without examining the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.707" offset="4313749">If we're talking about the Defendant's testimony, you know, he's not qualified to be an expert.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.407" offset="4332557">He can give factual statements about what happened to him and what was happening at the time of the crime, but he's not giving an expert opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.905" offset="4358575">So to us it does seem to be a different question about whether it's really reasonable to have an expert to rebut that testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.074" offset="4387206">The Court just doesn't need to decide that question in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.840" offset="4394311">There's also a second question that the General alluded to, which is if he makes factual statements during his mental examination, the Defendant, and then also gets up on the stand at trial, testifies and says something contrary, you know, whether you could use those for impeachment purposes, the court didn't grant that question.</text>

            <text syncTime="1118.649" offset="4581557">This is a -- a unique situation in that there is a court-ordered mental exam, but it only happens as a result of the Defendant's choice to give the notice of putting on the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.802" offset="4614157">And then the evidence for the exam, at least under the rules, never comes in until he puts on his evidence first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.252" offset="4635996">It's really a parity principle that the Court recognized in Estelle and in Buchanan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.876" offset="4654490">In those cases, we read them to -- for the Court to have said that there is sufficient compulsion in the ordering of the exam to raise Fifth Amendment questions, but when the defendant opens the door, the Fifth Amendment just doesn't give him any right to -- to stop the prosecution from responding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.182" offset="4715617">But if the Court wanted to find that there was no compulsion and these statements could be used for any purposes, we think that would be more than the Court said in those prior cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.569" offset="4745188">But this is a different situation in that it is the Defendant's choice that -- that affects whether this is ever going to come in.</text>

            <text syncTime="3397.616" offset="13697351">The Kansas Supreme Court interpreted, or we believe misinterpreted, the Fifth Amendment to say that once the defendant had put his own expert on the stand to testify in support of his mental health claim after this expert had examined the defendant, the government couldn't respond in kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.515" offset="13769031">And it's that bar on our participating in the factfinding in front of the jury that we are seeking to have overturned here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3422.356" offset="13796407">I think what he's saying is that, look, in Simmons, there is a Fourth Amendment problem and the defendant wants to testify in a Fourth Amendment hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.946" offset="13826709">And if he does, the State will take that statement and use it at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.929" offset="13842696">So because of the reasons -- I'd say the policies underlying the Fourth Amendment, the Court says, that's wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.130" offset="13863490">He can go testify at the suppression hearing and then they can't use his statement later.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.223" offset="13879790">So by analogy he says, it's a similar situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.691" offset="13897658">He says, it's the policy behind the Fifth Amendment that says if you're going to go see the government under compulsion, the psychiatrist, you shouldn't be able to introduce that later.</text>

            <text syncTime="3480.521" offset="14029001">Well, Your Honor, in the Simmons case, what the government sought to do was to take the defendant's unvarnished statements from the prior hearing and to introduce them without the defendant having put those issues into the fact-finding portion of the trial as affirmative evidence in the government's case-in-chief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.983" offset="14094830">In that regard, it is much more like Smith on its facts, where the court said even in the circumstances we're confronted with here, on those facts, we can't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.965" offset="14122833">The court specifically said later in the Salvucci case that it hadn't addressed the question in Simmons as to whether or not the government could use that evidence from the suppression hearing for impeachment purposes, which is much more analogous here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.429" offset="14172675">So it's an open question even under Simmons, even if it applied, and the Court would have to extend it in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.912" offset="14194618">The Court, I would suggest, shouldn't extend Simmons in that regard because, at the end of the day, the other differing -- different factor here -- and it goes to the line of question that started earlier -- is that there is something different, as the Court has repeatedly emphasized, in the nature that -- the actual nature of use and obtaining of mental health evidence.</text>
