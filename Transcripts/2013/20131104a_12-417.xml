            <text syncTime="263.680" offset="1159780">And the court of appeals argued that everything is, in a sense, protective.</text>

            <text syncTime="269.920" offset="1184649">Workplace hazards are different.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.786" offset="1196142">And in ordinary usage, when things are being used for that kind of protection, they are typically described in other terms.</text>

            <text syncTime="594.341" offset="2482412">It seemed like, to me, a brilliant statute, because if in fact the unions, those they represent, the workers, don't want -- want to be paid for donning and doffing, all they have to do is not put something in the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.386" offset="2550539">But -- and if they do put something in the collective bargaining agreement, they can exert their bargaining power to get something else which they must want more.</text>

            <text syncTime="745.303" offset="3086258">There is a 1991 Buffalo Law Review article that describes this history.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.422" offset="3098693">In one of those cases the union actually struck unsuccessfully for this and then proceeded on a legal track.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.944" offset="3136831">So that was what the CIO was doing.</text>

            <text syncTime="785.212" offset="3245814">It grandfathered in all existing violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.147" offset="3257622">Indeed, it -- it prospectively grandfathered things in, because if they would adopt a new practice, it would be illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.801" offset="3280191">And the example that the CIO gave was to pose it was the practice of the employer to turn back the clock an hour every day.</text>

            <text syncTime="1107.731" offset="4535950">Our answer to that, Justice Ginsburg, is that the statute says “ clothes ”, it doesn't say “ anything you wear ”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.102" offset="4565416">And we agree with the government that there are things you could put on that would not be clothes and that you'd have to be paid for.</text>

            <text syncTime="1124.041" offset="4601151">But there's -- but -- and indeed, the court of appeals in this case and most courts of appeals have held that there are things you put on that are not clothes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.232" offset="4641902">So the statute distinguishes between clothes and other things.</text>

            <text syncTime="1158.430" offset="4738764">And I guess another way of saying Justice Ginsburg's question is: Why should we look at a word that just says “ clothes ” and make that distinction as to what the purpose of changing clothing is, whether it's for sanitary reasons or whether it's for protective reasons or whether it's because people want doormen to look nice?</text>

            <text syncTime="1547.846" offset="6296394">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.465" offset="6310918">When Congress enacted 203(o), the Portal to Portal Act had already relieved employers of the obligation to pay for changing into or out of ordinary clothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.362" offset="6386464">There is little question that 203(o) was directed at the sort of clothing that, absent 203(o), could be deemed to be a principal activity, the changing into or out of clothing that was not already excluded by the preliminary and postliminary exclusion in the Portal to Portal Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.960" offset="6480818">Congress referred in 203(o) to time spent changing clothes, to time spent changing clothes that is excluded from the workday pursuant to an agreement, a collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.606" offset="6555424">It was in the context of an agreement with the labor organization that the time would be excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.609" offset="6583427">Collective bargaining takes place around activities and determines how certain activities are to be treated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.565" offset="6619267">Collective bargaining does not focus on whether or not a shirt is clothes or a pair of pants are clothes or protective eye gear, and that is how the statute was written.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.423" offset="6662735">Given those two points, the term “ clothes ” as used in the statute was intended to encompass the work outfit industrial workers were required to change into and out of to be ready for work.</text>

            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="1755.650" offset="7127610">Yes, what I think he's saying is this, that my puzzle was, why was this a big deal for the unions?</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.152" offset="7149658">All they have to do is keep their mouths shut and the employer is going to have to go to them and say, we want this in the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.372" offset="7170451">But he says: You haven't read those words “ custom or practice ”, and if you see the words “ custom or practice ” you'll see that an awful lot of businesses or firms or manufacturing across the country actually has long had a custom or practice where they didn't pay for that or they didn't exclude it, or they didn't -- so in those circumstances, it's the union that's going to have to go to the employer and say: Please put some other words in the agreement so we get this out of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.956" offset="7280792">And now I have no idea -- I think that's what his point was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.327" offset="7298347">And of course this is an empirical question in part of, that kind of point, which is logically sound, affects a certain number of workers in industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.718" offset="7343904">And I would next be curious either you or the SG or anyone has some estimate of what we are talking about quantitatively.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence C. DiNardo</label>
            <text syncTime="1818.906" offset="7380684">--So for the first part of the question, the notion of custom or practice is a notion of agreement or, at the very least, long-time acquiescence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.179" offset="7413703">If a union is not able to get a provision in a labor contract that satisfies it on this subject, it seem -- it simply needs to object to the nonpayment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.654" offset="7463649">And then the question becomes, is this clothes changing preliminary or postliminary under the Portal Act and therefore not work, or is this a principal activity that absent an agreement under Section 203(o) is work and must be paid?</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.347" offset="7526448">The notion that custom or practice is something that an employer can unilaterally adopt is simply false.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.600" offset="7551421">It -- there must be the union's agreement, either expressly, as there has been for 60 years in this labor contract between the Steel Workers and U.S. Steel, that this entire block of time will be excluded, or a union must say by its silence or, absent an agreement, a formal agreement, but its verbal agreement, this is acceptable to us, we need not be paid for this beginning-of-the-day block of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.168" offset="7657687">And our suggestion that the test ought to be what these parties agree will be part of the work outfit that will start the day is, in large measure, a recognition of the way collective bargaining operates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.908" offset="7712649">A labor union and an employer don't say, should there be pay for putting the hat on or putting the jacket on?</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.831" offset="7740338">The discussion surrounds: What do we do about this 10 minutes or 5 minutes or 3 minutes or 15 minutes that precedes active, productive work?</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.137" offset="7785582">Do we include that activity?</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.672" offset="7795718">Now, granted, Your Honor, they said any time spent in changing clothes pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement, because that was the nature of the debate that preceded the 1949 amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.730" offset="7843888">The Department of Labor said perhaps some clothes changing is not preliminary or postliminary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.884" offset="7868547">Perhaps it is a principal activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.884" offset="7876593">They started the discussion around clothes changing, but the industrial practice that was being debated was this beginning-of-the-day activity, the locker room activity of getting yourself invested in the outfit you need to wear to be ready for work.</text>

            <text syncTime="1977.923" offset="8016714">But here the Seventh Circuit said the equipment that's involved, hard hats, glasses, earplugs, respirator, none of those things -- that they -- they take de minimis time, so we don't have to worry about them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.886" offset="8092573">In this case, will it make a difference if we go your way and say, everything worn counts; or the government's way saying, well, that these clothes count, but equipment can be distinguished?</text>

            <text syncTime="2016.548" offset="8171150">The -- the items, the hard hat, the earplugs, the protective eye gear and the respirator are not at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.786" offset="8196123">The -- the lower court said the time is de minimis, and it doesn't matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="2723.075" offset="10997285">--Not at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.775" offset="11000107">We only get to the question of Section 3(o) when a preliminary activity is deemed to be so integral and indispensable to the primary work that itself is primary work and therefore would be compensable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.768" offset="11056113">So as, for instance, the Court held in Steiner, there was chemical plant workers who the donning and doffing of their clothing for work purposes was so indispensable to their chemical factory work, it was deemed to be essential.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.112" offset="11117449">In that context, you might have a collective bargaining agreement that allows the union on behalf of the employees and the employer to provide for an alternative method of compensating this type of work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.402" offset="11162588">And in that context, there are two central inquiries that I would like to address today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.723" offset="11183904">First, are the items clothes?</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.841" offset="11196338">We think “ clothes ” actually has some textual meaning here and imposes a limit, which I'd like to discuss a bit further later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.512" offset="11223088">But second: If the employee puts on both clothes and some non-clothes items, does the overall process still nevertheless constitute the activity of changing clothes?</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.822" offset="11276273">Now, we didn't have to go in very deep depth into that question in our brief because all the items here are clothes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.576" offset="11303336">But I think it would be actually quite useful to discuss for a little bit the activity of changing clothes and then to discuss the specifics.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.098" offset="11333429">I think it would help the Court out at least in providing a more general rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.466" offset="11346908">The activity of changing clothes is used in the -- in the statute to exclude time spent in changing clothes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.220" offset="11377837">Congress used the gerund “ changing ” to describe an activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.441" offset="11394764">It is a verb form that's modified by changing, by clothes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.043" offset="11405213">So it is an activity of changing clothes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.745" offset="11415976">We think that activity also includes ancillary matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.464" offset="11430813">So for instance, if a worker comes into a locker room, spends some time doing the combination on the locker, opens it up, take -- opens the locker, that is not actually changing clothes per se, but it's part of the activity of changing clothes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.306" offset="11490268">So, for instance, if the worker also happens to put on some goggles, pop in an ear plug, maybe even snap on a utility belt in the context of changing clothes, those things are part of “ changing clothes ” as part of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2874.893" offset="11604580">However, there are some marginal cases where there is a collection of equipment, what we would deem to be equipment, which is put on by an employee that is so significant that it no longer can be fairly treated in conjunction with changing clothes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2891.152" offset="11669573">Well, this is an area -- an issue that comes up frequently in the meat packing industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.239" offset="11689948">And I can explain -- I need to explain a little bit about the facts to explain why we think that that is a much more difficult question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.076" offset="11717324">So in the meat packing industry, for instance, particularly meat packers that are rendering large portions of the beef, either with electric saws or very sharp knives or similar instruments, they actually have to put on what the government considers to be or has considered to be items of equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.722" offset="11791930">So, for instance, the meat packer might have a chain mail kind of like armor sleeve, chain mail gloves, another sleeve, chain mail kind of all over the front end, a belly guard, a Plexiglas belly guard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.149" offset="11857654">This is something that is very rigid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.185" offset="11865700">You can't even sit down on it, and in fact, you have to sterilize it in a chemical bath before you go into the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.070" offset="11885240">You have metal arm guard -- or a metal or, now, Plexiglas because of weight -- arm guard on the front that helps to deflect blows for your non-knife arm.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.676" offset="11919721">These types of things, we think, would not normally be thought of as clothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.213" offset="11937902">And so when you put on a smock, either before or under or over it, we think that the overall process there might not be fairly deemed to be considered changing clothes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3036.897" offset="12252626">--Our point is a linguistic point, which is to say I don't think all these things are normally characterized as clothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.853" offset="12288466">For instance, there are certain items in the body that are so distinctive in form and function they don't have normal analogues in what you would find people wearing in ordinary garments, you know, in everyday life, that it's deemed to be different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.911" offset="12336636">There are certain armor-type things, and I think maybe because etymologically because armor with the unique military context tends to -- we tend to call these things equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.118" offset="12377491">But for instance, the belly guards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.034" offset="12385119">In IBP, this Court called those things “ protective equipment ”, and I think that's the normal use of the term in that context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.474" offset="12414898">Just because you might say, oh, it's a vest, a chain mail vest for the specific function, particularly when aggregated with the rest of the equipment used in the meat packing industry, makes it an arguably different case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.098" offset="12461396">This case, however, I think is quite different, and I wouldn't necessarily use the term “ de minimis ”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.852" offset="12484384">We agree with the general concept that the Seventh Circuit reached, but de minimis is a term of art in the FLSA.</text>

            <text syncTime="3112.397" offset="12554601">There is a regulation, Section 785.47, that imposes some other requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.034" offset="12577171">We think it's not so helpful to use that term.</text>

            <text syncTime="3137.029" offset="12653135">Because it takes more time in relation to the clothing or the number of non-clothing items exceeds the number of non-clothing items?</text>

            <text syncTime="3158.708" offset="12739862">For instance, if an employer had an employee go out and as part of the changing clothes also go and collect your tools for the day and assemble them in your tool belt, no one would say that's changing clothes even if, at the end of the -- all of that you put on your top -- your jacket and you walked out.</text>

            <label>Mr. Eric Schnapper</label>
            <text syncTime="3314.669" offset="13363666">I'd like to address a number of questions that were asked earlier and then to respond to a point my brother made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.540" offset="13391147">With regard to the question of Justice Breyer, it is the experience of the United Food and Commercial Workers that the position companies take with regard to this -- these items is simply another bargainable unit -- item, like a holiday.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.500" offset="13454990">It is not treated by them as something unions are entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.852" offset="13468364">Justice Ginsburg, you asked why it matters here and whether the items -- how we characterize the items about which the government would disagree with the company, at least in isolation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.713" offset="13531894">And it matters for two reasons that have to do with the broader context of the Fair Labor Standards Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.432" offset="13550702">First, as we explained in our reply brief, there is an unchallenged rule that -- that an employer has to pay a worker for carrying tools or other things needed to do the job to the -- the work station.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.942" offset="13608799">If anything in this list isn't clothes and the workers have to have it at the work station, it would presumptively fall within the tool-carrying rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.898" offset="13644639">So it's very important to the company in this case that all of it be clothes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.783" offset="13660103">It's also important under the position that the government took in its brief in Tum, which was a companion case to Alvarez.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.288" offset="13694167">The government's position, with which we agree, is that once there is any non-203(o) exempt item, it starts the calculation of the de minimis time, which then includes not only the time for that item, but the travel time that follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.234" offset="13761981">It starts the de minimis clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.752" offset="13768041">If that's right, then if anything in this case isn't 203(o) exempt, the company would have to change its practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.406" offset="13794582">Justice Kagan, you asked more broadly why the test matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.394" offset="13814539">And I think the government was moving in this direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.512" offset="13827078">There is generally few, if any, cases involving poultry or poultry processing in which there's stuff that would -- would meet the, well, if I had a photograph of it, it looks like clothes test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.205" offset="13885801">It's almost all gear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.038" offset="13893116">And so in that industry, it's of enormous importance the difference between the government's position in its -- at least in its brief and the company's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.844" offset="13936374">That has great implications for those -- those plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.562" offset="13951212">Finally, if I might respond to a point that the government made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.183" offset="13969707">The government has introduced another concept, I think, that's not set forth in our brief but I want to address, and that's that in addition to the process that would go on, on any of our standards of separating out what things are clothes and what things are not clothes, the government would then overlay that with an ancillary test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.327" offset="14046298">And if it's predominantly clothes, then the whole thing counts as clothes; if it's predominantly non-clothes, it goes the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.266" offset="14082033">I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.133" offset="14085586">I think that's another area of uncertainty you shouldn't inflict on the lower courts and it's not consistent with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.606" offset="14111395">The statute doesn't say changing clothes and ancillary stuff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.558" offset="14127277">I'd agree about opening the locker.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.108" offset="14133442">It's -- it's necessary to change your clothes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.026" offset="14141070">But when you start taking things which, the government would agree, by themselves aren't clothes, and say, well, this -- this falls within changing clothes even though it's not clothes because it's sort of happening at the same time, seems to me you're opening up another can of worms that should stay closed.</text>
