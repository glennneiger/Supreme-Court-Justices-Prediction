            <text syncTime="12.891" offset="158705">Patent law places the burden of proving infringement on the patentee.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.212" offset="180021">And until this case, it was settled that the burden does not shift if the issue arises in a declaratory action seeking a judgment of non-infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.650" offset="221713">The Federal Circuit imposed a different rule in suits brought under MedImmune where the party seeking a declaration of non-infringement is a licensee.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.058" offset="267375">That was error.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.577" offset="273435">Allocation of the burden of proof inheres in the governing substantive law while the Declaratory Judgment Act is procedural only and does not change substantive rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.468" offset="325053">The burden of proof in MedImmune actions, like all other declaratory actions, remains where it would have rested in the equivalent coercive suit brought by that patentee.</text>

            <text syncTime="70.810" offset="390359">It doesn't concern the burden of production; is that right?</text>

            <label>Mr. Seth P. Waxman</label>
            <text syncTime="73.929" offset="402898">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.396" offset="404674">That's -- that's the issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.462" offset="413034">Although as we point out, that the word ‵‵ burden of proof ′′ -- I think the word ‵‵ burden of proof ′′ used in the opinion below could be thought to be addressed to both points, but the parties agree that the relevant consideration here is the burden of proof, and that trial judges do retain discretion to make rules about ordering -- the ordering of proof in patent cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="103.715" offset="522016">Well, if that's all that's involved, then the case doesn't seem to amount to quite as much as one might have thought otherwise, does it?</text>
            <text syncTime="109.685" offset="545840">If -- suppose the -- the patentee has the burden of production so they would have to explain why there was infringement; they would have to introduce proof of infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.875" offset="582621">And the only difference is who wins when the -- the factfinder thinks that it was exactly in equipoise.</text>

            <text syncTime="128.147" offset="619714">Well, that, of course, was not what happened in -- not what the Respondent maintained should happen in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.800" offset="642389">But taking your question as it is, this Court has pointed out repeatedly that the burden of -- where the burden of persuasion rests is very often outcome -- outcome determinative.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.025" offset="691290">And that is certainly true in patent cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.644" offset="705710">What the jury is told about who has the burden of persuasion is surpassingly important in many cases, including many patent cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.452" offset="748968">And that's the issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.237" offset="760044">I mean, the substantive -- the -- the reason why the Federal circuit erred is clearly doctrinal, which is this Court has said over and over again that burdens of proof, like standards of proof, are substantive.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.746" offset="826082">They inhere in the substantive right, and the Court has also said repeatedly that the declaratory judgment action is procedural only and doesn't change substantive rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.304" offset="868400">But I think if you go to a -- to the policy question, Justice Alito, reversing the burden in a declaratory action would impair the purpose and utility of the Declaratory Judgment Act, which was enacted to provide a mechanism for determining how the equivalent coercive action would be resolved without the -- without requiring the declaratory judgment plaintiff to subject itself to retrospective liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.923" offset="986787">And, indeed, shifting the burden would threaten the issue preclusive effect of the declaratory judgment, frustrated--</text>

            <text syncTime="228.346" offset="1020537">It seems to me we could -- all that may be true, but we need to cut down to the basic issue, which is MedImmune changes all that.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.833" offset="1050421">The idea is you're moving along with the license, everybody's happy.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.952" offset="1066931">All of a sudden you jump into court.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.920" offset="1074872">Why shouldn't you have the burden as the party who seeks to disturb the status quo?</text>

            <text syncTime="246.808" offset="1094412">--Well, the -- the reason, Mr. Chief Justice, is the reason that the burden of proof is substantive, and a declaratory judgment action under the Act is not -- is aimed not to change any substantive rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.400" offset="1152717">And that's why all of the decided cases in this area, except for the one below, left the burden exactly where substantive patent law left it.</text>

            <text syncTime="310.897" offset="1350725">I mean, the issue that this Court addressed in MedImmune -- the question that you're raising, I think, is one that goes to Article III jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="324.390" offset="1404746">Well, it goes to me to -- a basic question of fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.090" offset="1411538">When I picked up this case, I thought, how is the patentholder supposed to know what all these new inventions are?</text>
            <text syncTime="332.579" offset="1437452">What does it know about it?</text>
            <text syncTime="334.146" offset="1443721">But then I answered my own question by saying, well, it gave notice of infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.031" offset="1459290">But -- that's why I've asked if the notice is essential to your position?</text>

          <turn speaker="seth_p_waxman" startTime="342.268" stopTime="436.897">
            <label>Mr. Seth P. Waxman</label>
            <text syncTime="342.268" offset="1476217">I think the notice is the -- well, it's essential to the Article III MedImmune question whether or not there actually is a case or controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.624" offset="1513625">So, in this case, it's perfectly obvious because the cont -- the license requires Medtronic to affirmatively go to Mirowski within 30 days of introducing any product and not only tell -- providing notice of the product, but providing the manual, the diagrams and the manuals that are given to physicians so that Mirowski can determine within 60 days whether or not to assert infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.275" offset="1624279">In MedImmune, you didn't have that procedure, but the Court still held in the context of that case that because Genentech had made clear that it thought that the Cabilly patent covered the accused devices, there was sufficient -- sufficiently concrete controversy that MedImmune did not have to stop paying royalties and breach the license.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.176" offset="1723858">And -- and so, therefore -- I think I may be talking around your question, but I am trying to get to the point that the -- the requirement of some notice, the -- the patentee -- there's no declaratory judgment jurisdiction if the patentee doesn't know about the product, has -- has never done anything to suggest that the product -- that his or her patent reads on the product.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.474" offset="1825004">But that is an Article III question that would be -- you wouldn't get to the burden of proof if you couldn't satisfy MedImmune.</text>

            <text syncTime="436.897" offset="1854679">Mr. Waxman, what do you make of the patent listing non-infringement as an affirmative defense in an infringement suit?</text>

            <label>Mr. Seth P. Waxman</label>
            <text syncTime="451.906" offset="1914761">We agree with the articulation of the point by the Solicitor General in the United States brief, which is that the cases have recognized that non-infringement can either be a general defense -- that is, when -- when non-infringement is simply a general denial of a cause of -- of a claim of infringement, it is not an affirmative defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.605" offset="2013608">But there are particular types of non-infringement claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.176" offset="2031894">And the ones that I'm familiar with are prosecution history estoppel and the experimental use exception that are affirmative defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.733" offset="2078079">In other words, those are situations in which the alleged infringer says: Hey, I'm not saying that your patent doesn't read, all the claims of your patent don't read on my invention; I'm claiming non-infringement because I was making experimental use and that has affirmatively been determined by Congress not to infringe.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.599" offset="2177553">Or, yes, your -- the elements of your claim read upon my invention, but during the prosecution of the patent in the Patent Office, you disclaimed some claim scope, and under prosecution history estoppel, this Court elucidated in Festow there is no infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.112" offset="2259577">This is a case involving a general denial of infringement and therefore it is not an affirmative defense.</text>

            <text syncTime="571.602" offset="2393533">So a defense of non-infringement, a general defense of non-infringement, is not an affirmative defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.070" offset="2411401">And in the -- the potential or correlative, coercive action which would have been a suit for patent infringement by Mirowski had we ceased making the royalty payments, they would have borne the burden of proving infringement unless we raised an affirmative defense like prosecution history estoppel or experimental use, in which case we would have the burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.538" offset="2521324">The point of the Declaratory Judgment Act is that the burden is left exactly where it would have been had there been no -- had the identical issue arisen in the absence of the declaratory judgment procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.964" offset="2579003">And in this respect, it is identical to the jury trial right, which this Court held in Beacon Theatres v. Westover is also an element of the substantive claim and also cannot be deprived by the peculiarity of a declaratory judgment being a claim for an equitable remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="757.222" offset="3136038">In -- in the -- the situation that -- sort of bogeyman situation that Mirowski and the I -- intellectual property owner's brief articulate, which -- imagine, which is you license -- I have a -- I have a product, you have a patent, you license it to me, and I turn around the next day and sue for non -- a declaration of non-infringement, there are any number of ways that you, as the patentee, could protect yourself from that extraordinary eventuality.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.676" offset="3261843">You could provide, for example, that -- I -- you would require me to issue a -- you know, to -- to -- to pay a paid-up royalty for all use.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.651" offset="3309700">Or you could simply say: We don't care whether the patent infringes or not; you agree to pay me three dollars per unit sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.423" offset="3340838">Or you could put a provision in that would say: If you sue for patent infringement, the royalty rate goes to 3X.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.628" offset="3373648">Or for that matter, if you sue, that will -- that can -- I can deem that a breach of the license agreement and recover the remedies that patent law allows, an injunction and treble damages and attorneys' fees in the context of a -- a willful action.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.692" offset="3457866">I want to underscore, although the Federal Circuit made a broad rule, exactly what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.430" offset="3480854">In this case, Mirowski -- this license is from 1991.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.315" offset="3496423">Mirowski -- it's not in the record, but there's no dispute that Mirowski has received hundreds of millions of dollars of royalties from Medtronic for its patents.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.570" offset="3537383">It gets, as a benefit of this license, notice, as I said, within 30 days of every new product and the manual, and it can require Medtronic to start accruing royalties and an interest rate of 2 -- of 2 points over prime as soon as it sends us a notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.149" offset="3627767">And moreover, in the -- in the litigation tolling agreement, we agree that, even though we are not a party in the reference St. Jude action, we would be bound by any determination in that adjudication whereas otherwise we wouldn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.861" offset="3698611">So this license agreement was enormously beneficial and couldn't be farther from the scenario of I have a widget, I agree to license it, and the next day I turn around and sue you.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.669" offset="3745840">But in that event, there would be lots and lots of remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.805" offset="3758379">I do want to underscore one other thing, That the Federal Circuit said that it was applying this special rule only in MedImmune-type cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.595" offset="3797563">But the rationale of the court is that what causes the burden to shift is the absence of a counterclaim for infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.884" offset="3842702">That would have, for example, caused the burden to shift in the Myriad case that this Court decided last term, where there was one researcher at NYU who had standing to bring a declaratory judgment action.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.294" offset="3900276">There was no basis for Myriad to claim infringement because he had made clear that he wouldn't -- he wouldn't engage in the research and clinical work that he was going to so long as he was in risk of patent infringement remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.737" offset="3962134">And that -- the source of the rule, the source of the law where the burden of proof lies, is in substantive patent law.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.045" offset="4007274">And this Court has said for 125 years that it rests with the infringer.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.765" offset="4022216">What neither the Federal Circuit nor my friend on the other side of this case has ever identified is what is the source of the rule that shifts the burden in a declaratory judgment action.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.323" offset="4072475">It can't be the Declaratory Judgment Act because that act is procedural only.</text>

            <text syncTime="1010.634" offset="4149693">The government agrees that using the same burden of proof that would apply in the hypothetical coercive action that underlies the Declaratory Judgment Act is the best thing to do in this mirror image declaratory judgment action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.794" offset="4202356">That best serves the purposes of the Declaratory Judgment Act and allows for final resolution of the types of controversies that this Court contemplated in MedImmune.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.400" offset="4236733">If I could turn to Justice Kagan's point about an incident in which the parties had actually agreed to whether certain products were covered by a particular license.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.089" offset="4275499">That would be different from the situation we have here, because the products in question here weren't actually in existence at the time of the underlying license agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.945" offset="4306950">The whole point of that aspect of the license agreement was to, as you said, channel future disputes into this particular dispute resolution mechanism.</text>

            <text syncTime="1064.888" offset="4366719">I was not about to suggest that, Justice Sotomayor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.657" offset="4377794">I was going to say that I think that's the -- that -- that that would probably be the least logical way to deal with the quandary that might arise from thinking that somebody is then trying to breach the license.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.179" offset="4419904">And we don't think there's any license breach here because there wasn't any prior agreement on the fact that these future products were going to be covered by the -- by these patents or they'd be practicing these patents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.253" offset="4464103">But even if there were some concern about the licensee turning around and challenging the agreement that it had previously made, it seems like the problem there is either that they should be estopped by what they already said in the agreement or Lear needs to be extended to keep them from being estopped in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.532" offset="4533275">But shifting the burden of proof seems like an odd way to get at solving whatever the quandary there might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.436" offset="4556890">And I think that at some point, this -- this also interweaves with a point that the Chief Justice made about whether Medtronic here is seeking to change the status quo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.208" offset="4591999">And we don't think that Medtronic is seeking to change the status quo here, for a couple different reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.759" offset="4610180">One of them is, as I was just saying, that the agreement here didn't actually reach -- the license agreement here didn't -- it didn't include a meeting of the minds about whether these particular future products would be covered by these patents, including one of the patents was reissued after the time of the license.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.621" offset="4677576">And also, this license agreement expressly preserved the parties' ability, including Medtronic's ability, to challenge both the validity and the enforceability of the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.429" offset="4720834">That's at page 13 of the Joint Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.715" offset="4730030">And So there's no way in which I think it can be legitimately said that Medtronic is trying to either get out of its contractual obligations or to change the status quo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.003" offset="4767123">The status quo right now is that the royalties are collecting in a certified account, and so, in a sense, both parties are trying to change the status quo in trying to get the stream of royalties that either is applicable to these products or isn't on the basis of the resolution of a question that the parties had not decided, but said would be decided in a declaratory judgment action like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.500" offset="4857089">And we think that the best way to think of a declaratory judgment action like this is that it is the mirror image of the underlying coercive hypothetical action that could have been brought against Medtronic.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="1199.042" offset="4903274">Well -- well, but I guess the argument is that it's the mirror image of an action that could not have been brought because Medtronic is paying royalties.</text>

          <turn speaker="curtis_e_gannon" startTime="1206.647" stopTime="1291.234">
            <label>Mr. Curtis E. Gannon</label>
            <text syncTime="1206.647" offset="4933680">Well, the same thing is true in MedImmune, and I think that the Court noted that the -- in MedImmune that the Declaratory Judgment Act was intended to help get the party out of the dilemma it would be in, in deciding whether it should continue to be effectively coerced into paying royalties that it thinks it doesn't need to pay or exposing itself to the risks associated with -- with breaching the license and -- and being subject to treble damages, attorneys' fees and the other remedies that would be available under the Patent Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.869" offset="5062621">And yet, even though there had been no infringement in that case and no breach of the contract in that case, which is also true here, because so far, everybody has been behaving the way the license expected them to behave, the Court recognized that the parties had a concrete dispute about the applicability of the patents to those particular products, that the scope of the contract was not going to require payment of royalties where the patent did not apply, and said that the -- the issues that were going to be resolved in the declaratory judgment action there were going to involve questions of patent validity, patent enforceability, and scope of coverage, patent infringement, which is exactly what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.827" offset="5218415">Medtronic has raised in their complaint -- the well-pleaded complaint that you would look to here is one that arises under the Patent Act and includes claims involving all three of those issues, just as was the case in MedImmune.</text>

            <text syncTime="1309.898" offset="5346728">We think that this case involves a claim that arises under the patent laws, for the reasons that I was just saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.952" offset="5370970">I think that the way to -- the way to conceptualize this is to look to what the well-pleaded complaint would be in the hypothetical coercive action that would be being brought against Medtronic if we didn't have the problem presented by the fact that they haven't actually breached the contract or infringed at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.865" offset="5450591">And we have every reason to think that that hypothetical coercive action is one that arises under the patent laws because it's one involving infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.452" offset="5484968">That's the dispute that the parties acknowledge that they have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.254" offset="5496149">In the litigation tolling agreement at page 20 of the Joint Appendix, it talks about the fact that the parties have a dispute under Section 271 of the Patent Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.327" offset="5528436">In the red brief here, Mirowski has -- has told us on page 48 that if Medtronic were to cease paying royalties, that the recourse would be that they would bring an infringement suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.301" offset="5572322">And the complaint here in paragraph 5 alleges that the claim here arises under the Patent Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.871" offset="5594578">And because it does arise under the Patent Act and because it's clear here that all of the defensive issues would also be Federal, as I mentioned before, I think there is no dispute here that this -- this would arise under the patent laws, which would provide for district court jurisdiction under Section 1338 and exclusive appellate jurisdiction in the Federal circuit under Section 1295(a) even before the amendments in the America Invents Act in 2011.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.023" offset="5699277">I think that there is one other point that would be worth making in response to some of the amicus briefs about the -- the potential problems here associated with whether the parties have an incentive to enter into these type of licensing arrangements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.900" offset="5770748">As Mr. Waxman already explained, the patentholder here got lots of benefits out of -- out of entering into an agreement like this, notwithstanding the fact that they would leave themselves open to precisely the suits that the agreement contemplated, which was a suit involving both infringement and validity questions; and that under the circumstances, there's -- they had plenty of incentive to enter into a license agreement, notwithstanding the fact that they would continue to bear the same burden of proof that they would bear in every other procedural context in which patent infringement claims have arisen up until now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.340" offset="5920482">And so I think that in that sense, that's -- that's not a sea change from their perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.477" offset="5941066">And -- and yet, even if they were to think it so, as Mr. Waxman explained, a licensor in that context would have several mechanisms that they could use in order to rejigger the balance between the parties if they wanted to, and -- and I think that we agree with -- with everything on the list that Mr. Waxman mentioned, including having fully paid-up licenses or allowing a suit for infringement or invalidity to constitute a termination of the license that would allow the patentholder to bring an infringement action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.212" offset="6052034">If there are no further questions, we would urge the Court to reverse.</text>

            <text syncTime="1503.340" offset="6120475">The Federal circuit got it right in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.142" offset="6131760">The Federal circuit took the well-settled law on burden of proof and it applied it to two stipulated facts and reached a conclusion that it had to reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.398" offset="6168750">It was controlled by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.516" offset="6173243">The two stipulated facts were: Number one, when Mirowski's counsel, me, wrote letters to Medtronic, that was not a notice of infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.192" offset="6231861">There could be no infringement in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.359" offset="6240534">Infringement is defined as</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.327" offset="6252446">"using a patented invention without authority. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.096" offset="6263522">Medtronic had authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.798" offset="6270314">It was licensed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.615" offset="6273553">The second stipulated fact -- and this is at page 51 of the Joint Appendix -- is that Medtronic is a licensee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.821" offset="6310438">It cannot be an infringer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.706" offset="6317961">So everything that you say about infringement involves a completely different situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.843" offset="6342516">There was no shifting of the burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.247" offset="6360175">The well-settled law that I referred to is the normal default rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.084" offset="6387447">The normal default rule is perhaps one of the most fundamental tenets of our jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.804" offset="6410330">It says that if a party files a complaint and seeks relief, it has the responsibility to prove that it is entitled to that relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.994" offset="6451081">And the normal default rule has the word ‵‵ default ′′ in there because it refers to the fact that the statute doesn't decide the burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.552" offset="6493399">And there's no dispute in this case that the statute does not decide the burden of proof.</text>

            <text syncTime="2527.559" offset="10217416">They wanted to get into Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.627" offset="10225670">At that time, the Federal circuit had a Gen-Probe ruling which says everyone's paying royalties, there's no dispute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2552.809" offset="10318353">So in the MedImmune case -- but they never got to it because -- because that MedImmune case was settled -- you have the exact same situation we have here, which is that there is no counterclaim, and therefore, MedImmune, who is seeking relief, has the burden to show it's entitled to relief.</text>
