            <label>Mr. Eric Schnapper</label>
            <text syncTime="8.687" offset="141404">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="10.856" offset="150076">Section 1514A is written in the classic language which Congress utilizes to regulate relationships between employees and their employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.246" offset="191663">Legislation regarding how an entity is to treat an employee is understood to refer to the entity's own employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.733" offset="217577">And that is particularly true here where the phrase ″ terms and conditions ″ of employment is used in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.471" offset="244535">If Section 1514A forbade only contractors to retaliate against employees under the terms and conditions of their employment, I don't think there'd be any question that the courts would understand it was referring to the contractor's own employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.914" offset="306289">The statute has the same -- that language has the same meaning, even though it's combined in this instance with prohibitions against retaliation by other types of actors.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.170" offset="339307">The First Circuit's decision interpreting 1514A to permit a contractor to retaliate against its own employees is inconsistent with its general usage and it leads to four implausible consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.679" offset="393329">First, it renders the statutory language regarding contractors virtually meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.898" offset="410256">Secondly, it renders that language with regard to contractors in the mutual fund industry literally meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.654" offset="437319">Third, it has the implausible consequence of permitting the very type of retaliation that we know Congress was concerned about.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.074" offset="466994">Retaliation by an accountant such as Arthur Andersen.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.343" offset="480055">And finally, it renders incoherent the provisions in 1514A and the related remedial provision regarding scienter, the burden of proof and an affirmative defense.</text>

            <text syncTime="152.648" offset="717247">--Your Honor, our view of this is that the -- the meaning of the term 〝 employee ″ depends on the context in which it's used and it ought to be assessed separately for each of the actors.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.122" offset="763118">So when it says no publicly-traded company may retaliate against an employee, it means an employee of the publicly-traded company.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.311" offset="803869">But -- and the same thing with contractor and subcontractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.346" offset="816094">But if we had a statute which by itself said no employee of -- personal -- no employee of an officer shall do something, the -- the normal reading of that would be to refer to an employee of the officer's company.</text>

            <text syncTime="203.663" offset="921315">I mean, really, I don't see how you can piece it out like that, that it includes employees of contractors, subcontractors, but not -- not of any officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.988" offset="974605">But let me ask you this: If it does include employees of -- of an officer, is it -- is it as much of a disaster as -- as your opponent suggests?</text>
            <text syncTime="227.945" offset="1018491">That is to say, would -- would a firing for something that had nothing to do with the securities laws be swept in?</text>

            <text syncTime="290.986" offset="1270625">But -- but the Congress deliberately wrote the statute to deal with ordinary wire and mail fraud, not just corporate public company related fraud.</text>

            <text syncTime="305.213" offset="1327467">That is, if the argument against throwing the contractors in the way you want, I think is, well, then there is no limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.484" offset="1356620">So a company that let's say is a publicly traded company, they have a building and they hire a gardener.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.740" offset="1393609">And the gardener is a gardening company and it has three employees and it works one day a week cutting their lawn and it works four days a week cutting somebody else's lawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.280" offset="1435823">Is the mail fraud -- and then they fire one of the three employees, or two.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.167" offset="1459333">And he gets annoyed and says it was because of fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.404" offset="1480231">Now, the fraud has nothing to do with the company that they're cutting the lawn for.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.391" offset="1500189">It has to do with some other customers.</text>

            <text syncTime="351.609" offset="1513146">So what -- how -- I don't think the statute intends to get that.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.244" offset="1527670">Does it want to make every mom and pop shop in the country, when they have one employee, suddenly subject to the whistleblower protection for any fraud, even those frauds that have nothing to do with any publicly traded company?</text>

            <text syncTime="399.856" offset="1706034">And we think that is not anyone who has ever had a contract with a public company.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.458" offset="1720453">〝 Contractor ″ in the ordinary parlance refers to an ongoing relationship.</text>

            <text syncTime="718.314" offset="2979869">But I think there are -- it's also important in this situation to bear in mind the following: I think Congress would have -- was reluctant -- it didn't itself draw a line because the experience of the Enron scandal was that all sorts of terribly complicated arrangements had been drawn up between Enron and these hundreds of off-the-books entities, Jedi, Raptors, LJM, and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.631" offset="3085195">I think Congress correctly concluded that if it tried to write out a description of what else it was covering, someone would think of a way to get around it.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.821" offset="3121975">And I think it certainly wouldn't have contemplated that Federal courts were to try to untangle these relationships to the point where they could figure out whether, for example, if Andrew Fastow was skimming off money from Chewco, whether that would be sufficiently related to Enron.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.485" offset="3204626">It's just, it's enormously complicated and I think Congress didn't mean to open the door to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.471" offset="3228555">And that's brought home by the fact that the statute is written more broadly than AIR-21.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.994" offset="3262618">It's essentially modeled on AIR-21, which is a statute adopted a couple years earlier about whistleblowing in the airline industry, particularly with regard to safety work.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.968" offset="3310579">In that statute, 〝 contractor ″ is specifically defined to mean an airline contractor dealing with safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.622" offset="3337120">They did not put that kind of limitation here, and I think it, in part, because it simply would have been very difficult to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.526" offset="3360734">And I don't think they meant to give the courts a commission to try to sort that sort of thing out.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.412" offset="3376303">The core problem with the interpretation of the court of appeals is that it really renders almost meaningless the decision of Congress to prohibit retaliation by contractors and subcontractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.571" offset="3432937">Contractors and subcontractors would rarely be in a position to engage in retaliation, but particularly to engage in the very specific kind of retaliation specified in the statute, retaliation in the terms and conditions of employment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1566.681" offset="6373384">Justice Alito asked why didn't Congress say all employers or no employers?</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.835" offset="6402014">There are approximate 40 whistleblower statutes on the books as of today, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.489" offset="6420613">And more than 30 of them, in fact, 36 of them, are phrased exactly that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.208" offset="6439526">They say 〝 No employer may retaliate ″ or</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.576" offset="6453005">"Any employer is prohibited from retaliating. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.895" offset="6462200">This statute is not phrased that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.647" offset="6473276">This statute, which Congress could have written that way, and Dodd-Frank 922 is written that way, this statute is written quite differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.736" offset="6501593">This statute says, 〝 No public company may retaliate ″, and then it has a subordinate clause and the subordinate clause is what's at issue here, that references officers, employees, contractors, subcontractors and agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.810" offset="6557913">Justice Alito also asked my friend, Mr. Schnapper, do you contend that the same construction should be given to officers and to contractors, and he acknowledged they have to say no, because the ARB has also said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.018" offset="6606710">In other words, an employee, the phrase that we are construing at the bottom of all of this, these turtles, is different they say for officers and employees and agents, presumably, than for contractors and subcontractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.195" offset="6659477">But that doesn't fit with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.480" offset="6668568">It doesn't fit with the tools of statutory construction, and it doesn't fit with what Congress was trying to do here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.817" offset="6693959">This was the -- the failure of Enron.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.168" offset="6707333">This was a bankruptcy situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.287" offset="6715797">Congress was acutely aware that corporate bankruptcies, failures, left victims high and dry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.726" offset="6749547">One of the other provisions in this title, Section 803, specifically deals with the dischargeability of shareholder fraud debts in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.814" offset="6781939">And what these sub -- the subordinate clause that added these corporate representatives does is make sure that if the employer, the public company, goes out of business, the way Enron had just done, somebody is on the hook for the money damages that Congress authorized for these employees like Sharon Watkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.728" offset="6857590">It's a very simple regime to make sure that the victim, the whistleblower, is not left high and dry if the company that is, by hypothesis, riddled with fraud goes out of business.</text>

            <text syncTime="2936.273" offset="11851784">We can certainly say this, though.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.807" offset="11857844">What we know is the SEC has not exercised its power under 3(a) or under 307 or under 501, also dealing with contractors of sorts, to provide for whistleblower protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.032" offset="11910821">If it chooses to do so in the future, then we would have a different lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.186" offset="11927435">What we have now, however, is the unadorned statute passed by Congress, which deals with public companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.923" offset="11954393">We have the First Circuit in an exhaustive opinion construing it, again using all the ordinary tools of statutory construction, which this Court has directed the lower courts to do, to determine plausibly, as everyone agrees, plausibly that it only covers public companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.182" offset="12015415">We have a reading, then, that gives meaning to every single meaning to every single word in the statute, that is comprehensible, that fits the purpose of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.538" offset="12048852">Remember the overall purpose of the statute is disclosure by public companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.423" offset="12064316">It is not protection of investors, as some at times have said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.859" offset="12074138">It is disclosures by public companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.492" offset="12080617">Private companies make no disclosures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.544" offset="12088871">They are not governed by the securities laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.179" offset="12095350">So excluding private company employees makes perfect sense in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.898" offset="12110292">Mutual funds, Mr. Schnapper at page 13 of his reply brief says: Well, the advisors make all the disclosures for the mutual funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.404" offset="12140280">We had that argument, Your Honor, two years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.854" offset="12150102">Justice Thomas wrote the opinion for the Court in the Janus case, which rejected that very argument and said the mutual fund and the advisor are separate companies; the mutual fund makes the disclosures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.609" offset="12185106">Congress has set up the mutual fund industry that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.628" offset="12193152">The ICI's brief in this case explains very cogently, I believe, all of the separate protections, including the independent board of directors and the chief compliance officer mandated by the SEC's '40 Act recommendations, that protect the investors in mutual funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.238" offset="12247591">So we have a coherent, on the First Circuit side, a coherent reading of the statute that my friends admit is plausible, that gives meaning to every word in the statute, that fits exactly the title that Congress used.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.844" offset="12290014">And the title is legislative language passed by Congress signed by the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.314" offset="12307882">It fits every word of the legislative history.</text>

            <text syncTime="3160.452" offset="12748515">And remember, I am going to agree with my friend Mr. Schnapper on something.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.837" offset="12761995">Congress recognized that Enron was structured in a way to try to get the liability out of headquarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.158" offset="12787281">They had all these subsidiaries, they had Chewco and Ponderosa and all this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.629" offset="12801178">And Congress recognized that corporations might try to avoid their liability, so that by picking up officers, employees, contractors, subcontractors and agents, they were trying to make sure that if the company tried to lay off the responsibility on somebody else, they would still get captured because their employees were doing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.904" offset="12870246">They could have done that just under agency.</text>

            <text syncTime="3390.785" offset="13669802">With regard to the suggestion earlier that the ARB has taken the position that every contract -- every firm that has a contract with a public company is a contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.093" offset="13715046">Actually, in the Fleszar case, which is mentioned in both the Respondent's brief and our yellow brief, the -- the ARB is for the opposite position and -- and took a position, I think, consistent with the view we've advanced, which is not every contract renders you a contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.151" offset="13767291">With regard to Arthur Andersen, the discussion in the Senate Report about why there's a need to deal with retaliation is repeatedly about Arthur Andersen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.244" offset="13819640">Many of the people who actually understood what was going on at -- at Enron were Arthur Andersen employees, not most of the run-of-the-mill employees at Enron, and they were the ones who remained silent in the face of this very, very serious problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.635" offset="13873244">With regard to the origins of this phrase contractor, my brother, Mr. Perry, was right, it comes from AIR-21.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.789" offset="13905844">The preliminary AIR-21 regulations regarding what it means were issued prior to the adoption of SOX and they said it included employers -- employees of employers, which has remained the view of the agency throughout.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.250" offset="13971673">My colleague -- with regard to AIR-21, the history here is, I think, important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.070" offset="13998945">This statute referred to air carriers and contractors and subcontractors, and the court below assumed that that meant that employees of subcontractors and contractors were covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.462" offset="14040532">The First Circuit's theory was that Congress meant to narrow the meaning of contractor employees because it added retaliation by officers and employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.520" offset="14092777">And it seems to me that that is precisely the wrong conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.472" offset="14108555">When Congress added to the entities that could not retaliate, when it rewrote AIR-21 to add some other people that couldn't retaliate, it didn't mean to tacitly then eliminate the employees of contractors who were governed under AIR-21.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.683" offset="14169368">Finally, with regard to the question the Court has raised about whether it should explore the possibility of a limitation based on whether a contractor was acting as a contractor, we think it would probably not be prudent to take that on at this time for a couple of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.811" offset="14241884">First of all, a fair amount of work that was done by Arthur Andersen was not -- that was relevant wasn't done for Enron.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.899" offset="14274275">It was done for the off-the-books enterprises.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.317" offset="14283889">They did $5.7 million of accounting work for Jedi, where the debts -- one of the places where the debts were being hidden.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.772" offset="14313773">So you -- you'd get into that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.406" offset="14320251">Secondly, this provision is adopted against the background of a series of executive orders, most important which is Executive Order 11246, about racial discrimination by Federal contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.616" offset="14369152">That executive order has always been understood to cover all the employees of the contractor, not just the employees who are working on the government project.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.805" offset="14405933">And I think that's an important part of the background.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.507" offset="14416695">Congress has not tried to -- the Executive Branch hasn't limited it to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.292" offset="14431846">And in the Civil Rights Restoration Act of about 1986, Congress rewrote Title 6 and Title 9 to have institution-wide application rather than to do little parts of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.349" offset="14484091">This issue about what a contractor might be doing as a contractor hasn't been vetted in lower courts and we think it would be not prudent to try to -- to take that on here.</text>
