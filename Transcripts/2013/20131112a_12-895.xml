            <text syncTime="11.389" offset="151197">It has long been a bedrock principle of American law that aiding and abetting liability requires proof that an accomplice acted with purposeful intent to facilitate or encourage the crime of conviction and that mere knowing assistance is insufficient.</text>

            <text syncTime="56.253" offset="330711">There was never evidence of foreknowledge; the government never asserted evidence of foreknowledge.</text>

            <text syncTime="74.231" offset="402600">But let me ask you this: Would the instruction that was given, which was at JA 196, would it be okay if Paragraph 1,</text>

            <text syncTime="1534.983" offset="6245669">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.918" offset="6253401">I'd like to start by defining exactly what the government contends the mens rea requirement is for aiding and abetting, and then give the Court an example -- two examples to show how it differs both from what Mr. Elwood is saying and how it differs from a knowledge standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.241" offset="6302616">Aiding and abetting requires an intent to facilitate or encourage the commission of an offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.629" offset="6324245">And I think that breaks down into two constituent parts: One, an intent to make some action easier or to encourage some action by the principal; two, the knowledge that the principal intends to commit a crime of which that action is a constituent part.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.472" offset="6383595">What Mr. Elwood is saying is something quite different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.922" offset="6393417">It's that you have to intend that the crime succeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.107" offset="6402090">If that's true, all paid accomplices are out if they don't intend that the crime succeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.611" offset="6424137">If the -- if the bank robbers say, hey, can you look the other way, security guard, while we go into the bank, we'll give you a thousand dollars if you do it, that's not aiding and abetting under his theory if the security guard says, well, I only wanted a thousand dollars; I didn't care whether you ultimately succeeded in the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.054" offset="6485891">We give an example in our brief: If the person actually gives the gun so it meets the actus reus requirement that Mr. Elwood has proposed, he actually gives the gun to somebody, not because he cares if that person commits the crime, which he knows he intends to commit, but as a favor for his friend--</text>

            <text syncTime="2247.001" offset="9093747">I mean, I guess that's the question: Is there always a reasonable opportunity to withdraw after you see that there's a gun in the offense that you didn't expect to be there?</text>

            <label>Mr. John F. Bash</label>
            <text syncTime="2263.946" offset="9161457">Two points on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.096" offset="9166054">First, I think a lot of that would come in through the duress defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.764" offset="9176712">I mean, if you really feel like, oh, my God, this guy has a gun and he might shoot me if I withdraw, it can give a pretty solid duress defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.818" offset="9196983">The other point I would say which is maybe a little tangential to the hypothetical, is there's a traditional doctrine of aiding and abetting law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.470" offset="9219553">This is at 2.06 of the Model Penal Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.838" offset="9229062">It's in the LaFave Treatise and the Wharton Treatise, that if you countermand your assistance after you have assisted but before the crime is accomplished or completed -- for example, if your assistance was only encouraging and you start discouraging, or if you take all actions possible to prevent the crime -- for example, you assisted, you have a change of heart, you call the police to prevent the crime, you are not liable for aiding and abetting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.704" offset="9320490">And I think that reflects a broader point, which is that the traditional common law contours of aiding and abetting work pretty well with the contemporary purposes and problems that this statute was designed to solve.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.126" offset="9358211">I mean, this is a statute about the mix of guns and drugs or guns and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.180" offset="9374407">And I don't see why Mr. Elwood contends that if you assist one side of that equation or the other it is a different result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.832" offset="9396977">I think if you assist either side of that equation, knowing that the equation is going to happen, by the principle, that is aiding and abetting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.403" offset="9419337">It's aiding and abetting under the historical test, I think it's aiding and abetting under this Court's cases, and I don't see why it would be a different result here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2369.980" offset="9585581">Well, of course, the prosecution's principal theory was that he was the gunman; he brought it along to facilitate his drug deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.550" offset="9607942">But assuming the theory of the facts that the gun was fired after Gonzales absconded with the drugs, I mean, I think one way to think about it is like this: Suppose that what had happened is that Gonzales had gotten ten paces, and Petitioner or Joseph had tackled him and immediately snatched the drugs back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.811" offset="9672934">I don't think this Court or courts generally would expect the government to charge two counts of possession with intent to distribute for that brief period in which someone snatches possession away and you get it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.267" offset="9710760">That wasn't certainly what the prosecutor thought here, and it's obviously not the issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.752" offset="9728732">The only way that question comes into this case is that Mr. Elwood is trying to say that the prosecutor understood that -- that you didn't need foreknowledge of the gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.591" offset="9764049">And that's not what the prosecutor understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.277" offset="9770841">The prosecutor understood that this offense could continue for at least some period after in which the Confederates gave chase to -- to reclaim the drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.630" offset="9800203">And that may have been a wrong theory, but no one below ever understood that you could be convicted if you didn't know of the gun until your participation ended.</text>
