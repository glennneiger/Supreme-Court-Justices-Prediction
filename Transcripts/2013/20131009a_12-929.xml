            <text syncTime="12.527" offset="156843">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.621" offset="169172">Forum selection clauses have been frequently used in contracts of all types.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.134" offset="187249">They should be enforced as written and the enforcement of a contractual forum selection clause should not just be left to convenience discretionary balancing tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.350" offset="228105">Rule 12(b)(3) in Section 1406 of the United States Code provide appropriate and effective means for enforcing a contractual forum selection clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.344" offset="268124">The language of those provisions is written broadly.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.281" offset="279827">Congress used words like “ wrong ” and the rule uses the word “ improper ”, which have plain and natural meanings that are broad and are sufficient to authorize district courts to act to enforce the contractual clause.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="55.027" offset="326848">Is -- is it common in the treatises or in the cases to say that a forum selection clause is a venue provision?</text>
            <text syncTime="63.681" offset="361434">I thought venue was something that Congress determined.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_s_hastings" startTime="67.787" stopTime="111.691">
            <label>Mr. William S. Hastings</label>
            <text syncTime="67.787" offset="377839">Your Honor, the cases do discuss it as a venue provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.566" offset="392990">One example would be this Court's decision in Stewart addressed a forum selection clause in a 1404(a) transfer analysis, which is clearly a venue analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.079" offset="427053">In addition to that, with the 2011 amendments to the United States Code, Congress adopted a definition of venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.264" offset="463834">It's in Section 1390.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.731" offset="469685">That definition says the place of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.044" offset="478880">I'm paraphrasing it, but it's -- it's a pretty straightforward definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.339" offset="492046">The legislative history of Section 201 of that Act acknowledges that the definition was intended to make venue determinations easier and to make it clearer that parties could waive or adjust these types of provisions even by contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.457" offset="548575">The words “ by contract ”.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="111.691" offset="553486">In the Stewart case to which you just referred, the court said,</text>
            <text syncTime="114.504" offset="564771">"The parties do not dispute that the district court properly denied the motion to dismiss the case for improper venue under 1406(a). "</text>
            <text syncTime="123.015" offset="598834">because Respondent apparently does business in the Northern District of Alabama, which was not the jurisdiction specified in the forum selection clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.918" offset="634361">So what -- if we were to write an opinion in your favor, what would you suggest we say about that?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_s_hastings" startTime="136.995" stopTime="175.324">
            <label>Mr. William S. Hastings</label>
            <text syncTime="136.995" offset="654736">Your Honor, I believe the correct reading of that language is what the Second Circuit has said in the trade comment decision and others have written on this, that Stewart and -- and the text read by that footnote.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.334" offset="700085">That's Footnote 8, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.381" offset="704265">The text right there said,</text>
            <text syncTime="150.693" offset="709489">"The immediate issue is how we address 1404(a). "</text>
            <text syncTime="153.771" offset="721819">And the way the majority of the circuit courts have read it is the issue in Stewart, this procedural issue that we're here on today, which is simply not presented to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.687" offset="757450">And so the Court could very easily write a decision that acknowledges Stewart still controls on a 1404(a) analysis, but acknowledged that, like a majority of the circuits, that Stewart simply did not have to address this problem.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="175.324" stopTime="202.281">
            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="175.324" offset="808023">Well, that's -- that's true, but it means that the entire discussion in Stewart is beside the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.727" offset="829652">The Court wrote a decision about an issue that really never should arise because the party seeking -- as you see it, the party seeking to enforce the forum selection clause should proceed under 1406.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.676" offset="877404">So Stewart said, well, if -- if you proceed under the wrong provision, this is how it should come out.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.532" offset="904885">It makes the whole decision essentially meaningless, doesn't it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_s_hastings" startTime="202.281" stopTime="241.998">
            <label>Mr. William S. Hastings</label>
            <text syncTime="202.281" offset="915856">Justice Alito, I respectfully disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.155" offset="927350">And here's what the meaning of Stewart would be, as -- as we understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.215" offset="943651">First of all, under the facts of Stewart, the same situation would arise, of course, if a party waived their proper venue objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.229" offset="971654">That may be a narrow line of cases, but that would still apply in a case where a party doesn't assert the contract at first.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.664" offset="993388">But there's another place where Stewart would still apply: When a case is filed in the proper jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.036" offset="1018883">Here, if this lawsuit had been filed in Virginia, there would be a very limited place for exceptional circumstances for a court to look at a 1404(a) analysis and determine if public interest required something other than the contract clause.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="241.998" stopTime="264.772">
            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="241.998" offset="1074681">I don't see how that would -- I don't see how that would work.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.201" offset="1083563">You're -- this is the argument you made in your reply brief, that if this -- if the case had been filed in the jurisdiction specified in the forum selection clause, that court could nevertheless proceed under 1404(a) and transfer it back to the Western District of Texas, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.069" offset="1159004">That's -- that's your argument, right?</text>

            <text syncTime="266.942" offset="1174469">But 1404(a) says that it can -- a case can be transferred to a district where it might have been brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.143" offset="1199337">And your argument under 1406 is that they couldn't be brought in the Western District of Texas, that's a place where there's a wrong venue.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_s_hastings" startTime="281.576" stopTime="341.256">
            <label>Mr. William S. Hastings</label>
            <text syncTime="281.576" offset="1233088">And, Your Honor, the language of the statutes, particularly, the language you were just referring to about “ might have been brought ”, needs to be read in context of decisions from this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.183" offset="1271435">In Van Dusen, this Court held that that language “ might have been brought ” was a term of art.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.821" offset="1294005">The Court has never reached that conclusion with respect to wrong or improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.413" offset="1312395">And in Van Dusen, the Court said the “ might have been brought ” language was a term of art referring back to a congressionally chosen venue under 1391.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.565" offset="1344996">And so when this plays out under 1404(a), the court -- if the case is in the proper venue and we're on to the second issue of 1404(a), the proper reading of the language would allow the court in truly and exceptional circumstances to follow -- follow the language of the statute and send it to another place where Congress said the case could have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.214" offset="1423572">And, again, this is really the second issue in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.806" offset="1433917">We would emphasize that it's truly exceptional cases where parties had contracted for a forum, they've truly resolved the conveniences among the parties among themselves.</text>

            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="341.256" offset="1471742">Mr. Hastings, Section 1391 says the following,</text>
            <text syncTime="342.849" offset="1478116">"Except as otherwise provided by law. "</text>
            <text syncTime="346.988" offset="1494730">--not by contract --</text>
            <text syncTime="348.331" offset="1500059">"by law, this section shall govern -- shall govern -- the venue of all -- all civil actions brought in district courts of the United States. "</text>
            <text syncTime="357.967" offset="1538616">And then it goes on to specify certain rules for where venue in a case can lie.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.621" offset="1565261">So if I'm looking at that, I'm thinking, well, those rules apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.681" offset="1589502">And they can't be reversed or countermanded or whatever by -- by contract, by parties' agreement except to the extent that the contract can figure centrally into the 1404 analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.411" offset="1652405">But it's not appropriate in the 1406 analysis because, you know, the statute says what the statute says.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.954" offset="1678528">Here is venue.</text>

            <text syncTime="394.079" offset="1683021">And, Your Honor, the language of Section 1391, and the first part, I believe it's 1391(a) where it has the language of “ shall govern in federal courts ”, that's really no different than what this Court said in Stewart of Federal law controls venue in Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.119" offset="1743207">But the issue that comes up is that venue, venue is very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.289" offset="1759925">Venue, even before the current statutes were written, was recognized as being a privilege for the litigants.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.989" offset="1786674">They're to protect the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.566" offset="1793048">And even in Neirbo in the 1939, so almost a decade before the -- some of the current statutes were written, this Court said venue was subject to disposition by the parties.</text>

            <text syncTime="431.251" offset="1831710">That's only -- what that tells us is that venue is a highly waiverable thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.077" offset="1859086">You can stand on your venue right, but you don't have to.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.635" offset="1877267">My problem with your interpretation is you are allowing a private agreement to make a venue prescription that Congress enacted improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.178" offset="1923452">Congress said it was proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.756" offset="1933796">It may be that it should not apply in this case because the parties have consented to something else, but it's not a wrong venue.</text>

            <text syncTime="555.560" offset="2328976">The majority of the circuit courts -- in fact, more circuits than have weighed in on our favor use that language to enforce foreign clauses and clauses requiring State court forums.</text>

            <text syncTime="3335.086" offset="13447109">I have just a few brief comments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.428" offset="13460483">First, the parties bargained for the right result, and they bargained and reached a contract that should settle the issue of conveniens and where this case should be litigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.455" offset="13504578">Stewart has an important observation that I think needs to be emphasized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.250" offset="13519729">Even under a 1404(a) analysis, the majority in Stewart said The Bremen is still instructive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.841" offset="13542090">And if it's instructive on anything, on any rules enforcing a contract, it should be instructive at this level.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.041" offset="13574900">The burden should be on the party trying to get out from their contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.635" offset="13589319">The Fifth Circuit misallocated the burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.915" offset="13594439">The burden should also be a high one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.600" offset="13609172">It really should require exceptional circumstances or perhaps even more, and it should not be a case where a party can avoid its contract based upon inconveniences that were foreseeable at the time of contracting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.579" offset="13657029">For example, the fact that J-Crew hired Texans to work on its project.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.719" offset="13677613">It knew what the project was about and what it would need to do, and it should not be able to rely upon hiring Texans to change the deal it negotiated with my client.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.355" offset="13708124">There needs to be a clear rule that allows the courts to hopefully answer the questions about contracts and venue so we all can stop litigating these issues and know the right answers and avoid inundating the courts with motions to transfer for parties wanting to renegotiate contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.442" offset="13780536">Since the Third Circuit and Sixth Circuit and now the Fifth Circuit have adopted the minority position, there has been a proliferation of litigation when a contract already answered the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.828" offset="13826093">We cited many cases in our cert petition in a footnote, and I know there's been many more since then.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.528" offset="13844901">And those are the ones that you can find published.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.747" offset="13853679">That doesn't even mention the ones that are unpublished.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.137" offset="13859321">And so a clear rule needs to be in place to avoid these problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.183" offset="13875517">Justice Kagan, you raised the issue of forum non conveniens as perhaps the answer as to what would happen for a state or foreign contract clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.164" offset="13915432">I wanted to briefly touch on that because I don't believe that's the right answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.881" offset="13930270">The Bremen looked at a case that came up as a forum non conveniens case and said, we are not going to use the forum non conveniens test for enforcing a contract requiring litigation in an international forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.577" offset="13985022">They resoundingly rejected the forum non conveniens approach, and I believe the circuit courts have read Bremen as rejecting that approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.795" offset="14009891">If that were going to be the approach to answer the problem created by the Fifth Circuit for foreign and state courts, what we would end up with is a new common law approach, whether called forum non conveniens or called something else, that looks like nothing like forum non conveniens and probably a whole new line of litigation over how that's--</text>

            <text syncTime="3496.802" offset="14093901">Bremen comes up on a forum non conveniens motion, and the Court says, yes, the contract controls, quite properly so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.330" offset="14128069">So, you know, the fact that it comes up on a forum non conveniens motion has nothing to do with the question of whether the contract controls where, if it negotiated for a certain set of things and there is no exceptional public interest otherwise.</text>
