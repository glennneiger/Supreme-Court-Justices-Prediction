            <text syncTime="10.972" offset="150896">If the statute at issue here really does reach every malicious use of chemicals anywhere in the nation, as the government insists, then it clearly exceeds Congress's limited and enumerated powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.863" offset="198439">This Court's cases have made clear that it is a bedrock principle of our federalist system that Congress lacks a general police power to criminalize conduct without regard to a jurisdictional element or some nexus to a matter of distinctly Federal concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.539" offset="257162">The President's negotiation and the Senate's ratification of a treaty with a foreign nation does not change that bedrock principle of our constitutional system.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="47.314" offset="296241">But, Mr. Clement, you said that -- that the treaty is valid and the implementing legislation seems to largely copy the words of the treaty without adding anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.356" offset="364368">So, it's a puzzle that the treaty could be constitutional, but the implementing legislation that adds nothing is unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="79.116" offset="423405">Well, Justice Ginsburg, I guess I would quarrel with your premise, which is, it is true that the convention in the statute used similar terms and terminology, but there's one very important difference between the convention and the statute and that actually differentiates this case from Missouri vs. Holland.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.545" offset="485159">And that difference is that the convention itself doesn't directly regulate individual conduct at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.449" offset="508773">And so all the -- all the convention does--</text>

            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="103.983" offset="522879">But the convention -- but the convention tells the State parties, go regulate individual conduct in exactly the way that this convention regulates State parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.439" offset="560705">And then what the legislation does is, as Justice Ginsburg said, just mirror the convention as the convention contemplated.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="122.979" offset="598843">--Well, Justice Kagan, to be quite precise, though, what the convention says -- and this is Article 7, Section 1, it's 33-A of the blue brief appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.585" offset="633325">What it says is that each nation State that signs the convention agrees in accordance with its constitutional processes to pass penal laws that make unlawful for individuals conduct that would violate the convention if undertaken by a nation State.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.660" offset="693616">And I would respectfully suggest that making that translation, if you will, between what violates the convention if you're a nation State and what would be comparable individual conduct is not obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.552" offset="737188">And when the government does that through penal legislation, there's no reason why that penal legislation shouldn't have to comply--</text>

            <text syncTime="168.874" offset="782432">Meaning there -- there can be no doubt that chemical weaponry is at the forefront of our foreign policy efforts right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.580" offset="825273">Look at the Syria situation alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.698" offset="833737">It would be deeply ironic that we have expended so much energy criticizing Syria, when if this Court were now to declare that our joining or creating legislation to implement the treaty was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.743" offset="905939">We're putting aside the impact that we could have on foreign relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.195" offset="919732">Why is it, if it's okay to regulate the possession of marijuana, a purely local crime, why is it unconstitutional to regulate the use of something that can kill or maim another human being?</text>

            <text syncTime="235.932" offset="1050657">--Well, Justice Sotomayor, I think it really gets down to the difference between Raich on the one hand and Lopez on the other, which as this Court has held, that it is a classic and rational way to regulate commerce to basically prohibit certain items from commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="267.302" offset="1176150">But the problem in Lopez was the Federal statute was not structured in a way that had a jurisdictional nexus that made the statute only applicable as a regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="280.712" offset="1229857">The government didn't even assert it below.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.414" offset="1240620">It asserts it now, but as we took the case, the issue was whether the treaty supported the laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="291.337" offset="1272280">And we do think that the government, like a private party, can waive a constitutional argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.889" offset="1290566">On the other hand, I would say that we're not particularly concerned about the Commerce Clause argument because we think the Commerce Clause argument has the same basic defect as the treaty power argument, which is that the police--</text>

            <text syncTime="326.510" offset="1413028">I mean, I would take the position that if there really were a self-executing treaty that tried to impose criminal prohibitions, and I don't think there is any treaty like that, but if there were one, I would say here that it violates the Constitution for the same basic reasons that this implementing legislation does.</text>

            <text syncTime="350.889" offset="1510517">And, indeed, if you go back to the founding history, it's very clear that they thought about all kinds of subject matter limitations and James Madison and others decided, quite self-consciously, not to impose them.</text>

            <text syncTime="404.923" offset="1726602">It is certainly true that going back to the beginning of the country, there have been many treaties that have been implemented in ways that affect matters that otherwise would be within the province of the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.783" offset="1790132">One of the original purposes of -- objectives of the Constitution was to deal with -- with a treaty power was to deal with the issue of debts owed to British creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.256" offset="1836003">And there have been cases about the property rights of -- of foreign subjects, about the treatment of foreign subjects here, about things that are moving across international borders, about extradition and all of those.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.064" offset="1887203">But in all of those, until fairly recently, certainly until generally after World War II, all of those concerned matters that are of legitimate concern of a foreign State.</text>

            <text syncTime="459.122" offset="1943418">So can't we see something in that, in the meaning of a treaty, what it was understood to mean when the Constitution was adopted?</text>

            <text syncTime="756.231" offset="3131885">There's a chemist out there who manufactures Sarin gas -- I take it it's pretty easy to manufacture -- and sends it through the ducts of a house and kills everybody in it.</text>

            <text syncTime="778.996" offset="3222896">And as I understand how this statute applies to Sarin gas or other things certainly on Schedule I -- there are some Schedule I substances that are talked about both in the convention and the treaty -- those things are always unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.052" offset="3267199">What is particularly unusual about the statute's application to something like potassium dichromate or vinegar or whatever you have is that in most of its possession and uses it's perfectly lawful, and what makes it a chemical weapon in the government's theory is when it's used purely intrastate in a malicious way.</text>

            <text syncTime="834.681" offset="3445668">And I guess what I want to know is, you are imagining a world in which judges day to day try to get inside the head of treaty makers to think about, you know, in this case we understand that there's a national interest in regulating Sarin gas, but we don't think that there's a sufficient interest in regulating some other chemical or some other chemical or so on down the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.196" offset="3539709">It seems to me a completely indeterminate test and one that would have judges take the place of treaty makers in terms of deciding what is in the national and international interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="882.645" offset="3637511">And then as to the implementing legislation, we simply ask the courts to do what they do in every other context, which is to check and see if that implementing legislation is consistent with our basic chartering document.</text>

            <text syncTime="1545.222" offset="6287895">And Holmes scratched his head and said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.588" offset="6297299">The treaty under -- under Article 6 is supreme to both State law and not the other way around.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.476" offset="6316839">But he also said this one sentence that sort of bedeviled the lower courts here, which says, well, and if the treaty's valid, of course, the legislation is valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.148" offset="6347559">That made sense in the context of the treaty he had before him, because he had a treaty that directly prohibited individual conduct and a statute that enforced that individualized prohibition with criminal penalties.</text>

            <text syncTime="1909.818" offset="7746259">Now, if -- if that were a self-executing treaty, same sex marriage would have to be approved by every State.</text>

            <text syncTime="3186.184" offset="12851735">And I think the reason for that is that the treaty power is itself a great and substantial independent power of the national government.</text>

            <text syncTime="3271.973" offset="13194879">And with respect to the exercise of the treaty power, the Framers made a judgment that this power was going to be exclusively in the hands of the national government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.414" offset="13236571">And it needed to be exclusively in the hands of the national government in order to ensure that the United States could be a full sovereign on the world stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.454" offset="13272724">Now, it is true that the subject matter of treaties is different now than it was at the time of the founding, but the Framers understood that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.893" offset="13306579">They were careful not to impose subject matter limitations on the treaty power because they were wise enough to know they could not foresee what might be important for the United States to be able to negotiate about on a world stage in order to participate fully as a sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.335" offset="13372303">And the Chemical Weapons Convention is a deeply apt illustration of exactly why the Framers were wise in ensuring that there were not subject matter limitations on the exercise of the treaty power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.364" offset="13440430">The Chemical Weapons Convention -- the United States' leadership in the Chemical Weapons Convention has made a big difference in ensuring that this norm, which is in our national interests, our foreign relations interests, and our national security interest, is a norm that the nations of the world have agreed to and that we are then in a position to have leverage to insist that the nations of the world abide by it.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>

            <text syncTime="3385.232" offset="13647843">Just a few points in rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.816" offset="13654217">First of all, the Senate's role in the ratification of treaties cannot be a sufficient political check, and one reason is that sometimes the precise role they play as a check is to make a treaty non-self-executing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.008" offset="13710954">And so, to take Justice Scalia's hypothetical example of an international treaty that purported to regulate marriage rights, one thing that the Senate very well might do in that case is to say, well, we will ratify it, but we're going to make sure it's non-self-executing and maybe we will use our spending power or something to get the States on board, but we are not just going to impose a national solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.005" offset="13790994">So it doesn't make any sense to say that a non-self-executing treaty necessarily, even if it's valid, guarantees the validity of the enacting legislation, because some of the reason that you make a treaty non-self-executing is to preserve federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.496" offset="13844910">A second point is to respond to the argument, which I think I've already explained why it's not correct, but it is the suggestion that there is no daylight between the convention and the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.354" offset="13884408">There is huge daylight, and the daylight is precisely whether it affects individual conduct and how it affects individual conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.524" offset="13913038">With all respect, everything on Justice Breyer's List A is not stuff that I think implicates the convention at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.380" offset="13944489">But yet under the government's unwavering theory that you can't make any limitations on the statute, that's all covered by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.301" offset="13976150">There's your daylight.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.385" offset="13980538">Now, I would respectfully suggest that our statutory construction argument is one way out of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.121" offset="13999451">I think that you have to understand the way that “ peaceful ” is used in the statute is essentially a term of art.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.608" offset="14021394">I would analogize it to a situation where two scientists in Antarctica get in a fistfight.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.145" offset="14039575">Okay, that's not conduct we condone, but I don't think we've violated our pledge to reserve Antarctica for only peaceful purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.016" offset="14071026">And that's the same way we would like you to interpret this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.118" offset="14083461">Now, the government says you can't do that because that's going to mess up what's going on in Syria.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.755" offset="14101955">With all due respect, I assume that the issue in Syria is whether or not the nation state of Syria is doing something that would violate the convention if, contrary to fact, they were signatory to this convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.062" offset="14147199">So if you want to make clear that you're only talking about individual conduct, I think you can solve that whole problem right there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.216" offset="14171859">But if I'm wrong and the only way, as the government assures you that you can make this legislation work is to have it be in exercise the police power, well, then the answer is that the legislation is simply unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="3535.195" offset="14247719">Suppose that Ms. Bond used sarin gas and sent it through the ducts of Haynes' house; would you say that that's a peaceful purpose?</text>

            <text syncTime="3554.508" offset="14325041">And what makes something like vinegar or even potassium dichromate different is what puts it over the ledge from being an ordinary chemical to a chemical weapon is precisely its use and its use alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.383" offset="14368509">Now, Justice Kagan, you asked a great question: What was Congress thinking when they did this?</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.751" offset="14381988">I think, with respect, the Congress wasn't focused on this issue at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.820" offset="14398288">If you look at the legislation they passed to implement this, the chemical industry and others put in front of them the possibility that there was a Fourth Amendment problem with the inspections of chemical production facilities that were authorized under the convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.713" offset="14453772">When Congress had the constitutional problem in front of it, they had all sorts of provisions to deal with that constitutional concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.050" offset="14479163">Now, the future Ms. Bonds of the world didn't have quite the same lobbying resources as the chemical industry, so they didn't avert to this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.304" offset="14508212">And that's precisely why some kind of clear statement rule or the like would make perfect sense in this to make sure Congress doesn't exercise the police power when all it thinks it's doing is implementing a treaty.</text>
