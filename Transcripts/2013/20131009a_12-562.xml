            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="107015">We will hear argument first this morning in Case 12-562, United States v. Woods.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.546" offset="133137">Mr. Stewart?</text>

            <label>Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="6.919" offset="134600">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="9.872" offset="146408">The merits question in this case is whether the substantial valuation misstatement penalty applies when a taxpayer overstates his basis in property in connection with the transaction that is later determined to be a sham.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.475" offset="196876">The threshold jurisdictional question is whether the Court in this TEFRA partnership level proceeding has authority to decide that merits issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.019" offset="227074">I'd like to begin with the jurisdictional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.613" offset="237418">And before I focus the Court's attention on the text, I'd like to make two quick preliminary observations about jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.359" offset="264377">The first is that the question we say is appropriate for resolution in partnership level proceedings is not whether any individual partner will actually be made to pay the penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.997" offset="306904">There's no question in this case that the determination whether the penalty will actually be imposed on individual partners, and if so, in what amount is properly reserved for partner level proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.461" offset="352775">The question is simply whether the Court in the partnership level proceeding can make the threshold determination whether the sort of error that the IRS identifies on the partnership return can trigger a penalty down the road if the individual partner prepares his or her return in a manner consistent with the partnership return.</text>

            <text syncTime="80.499" offset="428948">I thought I understood that to be your point in your brief, but I -- there is one thing missing from here.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.497" offset="460922">I also thought you were saying that you could impose the penalty before the amount was determined on the partnership level.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.822" offset="494254">That the tax that you could, without a notice of deficiency, require a payment upfront.</text>

            <label>Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="102.226" offset="515884">There are two separate questions here.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.551" offset="525183">The first is: What can be determined at the partnership level?</text>
            <text syncTime="107.769" offset="538035">And once the partnership level proceedings are complete, there are subsidiary partner level proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.594" offset="565307">And some partner level proceedings require a deficiency notice, some partner level proceedings do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.780" offset="586101">Now, it is part of our position that once the applicability of the penalty has been determined at the partnership level, the penalty can then be imposed on individual partners in partner level proceedings without a deficiency notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.401" offset="640540">It can still be challenged through a refund proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.619" offset="649422">But because -- there's never the imposition of additional tax or penalties on the partnership itself.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="141.897" stopTime="175.633">
            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="141.897" offset="674499">That is the incongruity of your position in my mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.318" offset="692262">You claim that the decision of -- of whether or not or what the true value is of the basis and how much needs to be paid can't be determined until the partnership level -- until the partner level determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.762" offset="766032">Yet, you're claiming that you're entitled to an amount of money beforehand, before that decision is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.024" offset="799051">There's a tension in my mind about that.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="malcolm_l_stewart" startTime="175.633" stopTime="377.646">
            <label>Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="175.633" offset="809500">Let me explain, as best I can, the sequence of events that we think would unfold if this Court affirmed our view of the -- both held that the courts below had jurisdiction and agreed with our view of the way the penalty is supposed to operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.282" offset="872089">If the Court agreed with the position that we take in Part 2 of our merits brief, namely, that a deduction that is claimed in connection with a transaction that is later determined to be a sham can trigger -- if they agree -- if you agree with us on that legal issue, then the IRS would examine the returns of the individual partners, and it would verify that they did, in fact, claim deductions in connection with this transaction because they would have this Court's agreement with the proposition that that's the sort of thing that can trigger the penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.065" offset="1007195">They would then determine what the amount of the overpayment -- of the underpayment was and they would presumably assess a 40 percent penalty on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.453" offset="1036765">There would be a subsidiary question because the FPAA, the Final Partnership Administrative Adjustment, said the partnerships were shams.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.652" offset="1073546">But it also said that the individual transactions, the purchases and sales of the options and the currency and the stock, they would be treated as though they had been engaged in -- by the individual partners.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.101" offset="1123387">And so at the partner level, there might be further determinations about what -- what a relatively small amount of tax the individual partners would -- would owe on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.191" offset="1163720">And then if a partner -- if a penalty were assessed on the partner, the partner would have to pay the penalty before challenging it in through a refund action.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.672" offset="1205621">But -- but we might want to ask on what ground could the partner want to challenge the penalty at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.592" offset="1229340">The partner couldn't at that stage want to make the argument that's being made in this Court, namely, that this is just not the sort of situation to which the substantial valuation misstatement penalty applies, because that issue would have already been resolved against the partner in this proceeding by hypothesis, if the Court agrees with us on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.114" offset="1307394">And so the partner would have had an opportunity to get that threshold legal issue resolved without prepaying the penalty first.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.753" offset="1338009">Now, if an individual partner wanted to raise the good faith reasonable cause defects that's provided in 26 USC 6664(c), the partner would have to pay the penalty first before seeking a refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.059" offset="1391195">But that's pretty clearly consistent with Congress's intent, because Congress specified in TEFRA itself that after the court in the partnership level proceeding has determined the applicability of the penalty, the partner can still, through refund proceedings, contend that the penalty was erroneously imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.519" offset="1469039">And that language tells us two things: It tells us first that Congress didn't see any necessary unfairness in requiring a partner to pay the penalty first before raising certain sorts of challenges.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.484" offset="1520866">And it also indicates that by applicability, Congress must have meant something different from will the penalty ultimately be imposed, because if the partnership level determination that the penalty was applicable meant that all the requirements for imposition were satisfied, there'd be no room for the partner to argue down the road that the penalty was erroneously assessed after all.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.241" offset="1607906">So--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="377.646" stopTime="414.645">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="377.646" offset="1617519">Mr. Stewart, can you explain the difference in the two proceedings?</text>
            <text syncTime="383.674" offset="1641657">First, your position that the proper review is of the final partnership administrative adjustment.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.797" offset="1678124">How would the penalty be adjudicated in that format, and if your -- if the taxpayer is right, that the adjudication must be made at the partner level proceeding, what would be the difference in the character of the adjudication?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="malcolm_l_stewart" startTime="414.645" stopTime="486.805">
            <label>Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="414.645" offset="1765582">--When we say that the applicability of the penalty should be determined in the partnership level proceeding, all we mean is that the court in the partnership level proceeding should resolve the legal issue that is addressed in Part 2 of the respective briefs for the Petitioner and the Respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.578" offset="1829320">That is, the court should determine is the substantial valuation misstatement penalty the sort of penalty that can apply to a basis overstatement that is produced through a sham transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.229" offset="1879893">We wouldn't ask the court in the partnership level proceeding to go beyond that legal determination and to ask whether individual partners had actually underpaid their tax or whether they had actually misstated basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.880" offset="1926496">It's always theoretically possible in a case like this that the partnership could be determined -- that the partner could participate in sham transactions, but by the time it was -- he had to file his own return, he could get cold feet or he could get legal advice that indicated this just isn't going to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.405" offset="1996608">And so it's possible that the partner could prepare his return in a way that was lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.248" offset="2011968">And the IRS, after the partnership level proceedings were complete, would have to look at the partner return in order to see what that had -- what had happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.040" offset="2043106">I think the main practical -- I'm sorry.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="486.805" offset="2054182">I was just going to ask: If the question were determined of whether the sham transaction counts as an erroneous statement of the basis, if that were determined at the partner level and not in a partnership proceeding, would it be possible to have different outcomes--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="malcolm_l_stewart" startTime="507.141" stopTime="508.546">
            <label>Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart</label>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>

            <label>Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="509.889" offset="2146551">Absolutely.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.796" offset="2150104">And I think that's the main practical difference between the way the system would operate under our view of TEFRA and the way it would operate under Respondent's view.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.496" offset="2188974">That is, under--</text>

          <turn speaker="malcolm_l_stewart" startTime="523.401" stopTime="564.245">
            <label>Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="523.401" offset="2200573">--Exactly.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.307" offset="2204230">Under Respondent's view, the IRS was not required to say anything at all in the FPAA about the potential imposition of basis overstatement penalties down the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.068" offset="2251250">If the FPAA adjustments -- the shamming determination had been upheld at the partnership level, under Respondent's view, the IRS could then assess penalties against individual partners.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.703" offset="2297748">And if the individual partners raised an objection, the same arguments that are raised in Part 2 of the Respondent's merits briefs, that would have to be litigated potentially by different judges in different partnership -- in different partner level proceedings with potentially inconsistent outcomes.</text>

            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="564.245" offset="2363995">Would it be a fair way to look at this to say that what you do at the partnership level is anything that doesn't require looking at an individual's tax return?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="malcolm_l_stewart" startTime="571.910" stopTime="650.113">
            <label>Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="571.910" offset="2394610">I think that's a fair way to put it.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.425" offset="2404641">And another way we would put it is: Any question that will necessarily have the same answer for all partners should presumptively be resolved at the partnership level.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.546" offset="2441108">That is, the legal issue that's briefed in Part 2 of the parties' respective merits brief, we may be right, Respondent may be right, but the answer is going to be the same for all partners.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.902" offset="2478620">Either this is the sort of basis overstatement that can trigger the penalty or it isn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.197" offset="2499727">The second practical difference that I wanted to -- to allude to, at least briefly, between our position and the Respondent's is that 6226(f) is the provision that deals with the Court's jurisdiction in a partnership level proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.300" offset="2544135">6221 is the provision that tells the IRS what it's supposed to do at the partnership level, and it also tells the IRS determine the applicability of any penalty that's related to an adjustment to a partnership item.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.170" offset="2611635">Now -- now, one advantage of requiring the IRS to make at least this sort of threshold determination of penalties at the outset is that if the IRS makes an adjustment to a partnership item, and the IRS believes that it is the sort of adjustment that down the road could trigger the imposition of penalties, that's the sort of thing an individual partner would want to know in deciding whether to challenge the adjustment.</text>

            <text syncTime="664.030" offset="2763041">But there are -- I mean, there are provisions that deal with the way the limitations periods runs, depending on when the partnership return is filed and when the partner returns are filed.</text>

            <text syncTime="675.853" offset="2810375">We -- we would still be subject in assessing penalties against any individual partners to whatever limitations period the code provides and either we would or would not have obtained a legal ruling on -- on the legal issue whether the penalties are -- are the sort that could follow from this partnership item adjustment, but I don't think it would have implications for the statute of limitations.</text>

            <text syncTime="761.913" offset="3154564">And that concession necessarily depends upon the proposition that the determination of the partnerships are shams was an adjustment to a partnership item.</text>

            <text syncTime="772.018" offset="3195002">First, because the determination whether these are valid partnerships necessarily underlies any other determination that the IRS would make about the proper tax treatment of items reported on the partnership return.</text>

            <text syncTime="1095.324" offset="4488272">But if I could, on page 18a, we're talking about Section 6662(b), and it says:</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.116" offset="4515439">"Portion of underpayment to which section applies. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.068" offset="4543234">And then it says:</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.697" offset="4817728">"This section shall apply to the portion of any underpayment which is attributable to one or more of the following. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.689" offset="4573745">and then it lists six items.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.344" offset="4580328">Subsection (3) is the substantial valuation misstatement penalty that we're relying on here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.499" offset="4604987">Subsection (6) is a disallowance of claimed tax benefits by reason of a transaction lacking economic substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.386" offset="4632468">That's the -- the 2010 penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.916" offset="4642604">Now, the two points I would make are: First, it's very clear that many, many cases that would fall under Subsection (6) would also fall under Subsection (1) or (2); that is, they could involve negligence or disregard of rules or regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.818" offset="4694222">They could also involve a substantial understatement of income tax, which basically means any understatement of income tax that's 10 percent or more of the true tax owed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.861" offset="4730375">And so if there's no incongruity in saying Subsection (6) should apply to some cases where (1) and (2) would also apply, there shouldn't be any greater incongruity in saying it can apply to some cases where Subsection (3) would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.385" offset="4796517">The other point I would make pertains to the introductory language of that provision, and it says:</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.817" offset="4846254">And I think the primary practical significance of the “ one or more ” language is that it functions as an anti-stacking provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.893" offset="4874571">It tells you it doesn't matter whether your underpayment triggers only one of these penalties or all six of them; you're still limited to 20 percent unless you can get the -- the 40 percent through some other provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.732" offset="4941862">So we can't take advantage of the fact that the -- that more than one penalty applies to a particular transaction by getting 20 percent on top of 20 percent on top of 20 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.179" offset="4991704">But the very fact that Congress used that language</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.898" offset="4998600">"which is attributable to one or more of the following. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.912" offset="5014587">indicates that it anticipated situations in which particular underpayments would be attributable to more than one of those penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.580" offset="5049278">It didn't see any anomaly in the idea that a penalty that triggers Subsection (3) could trigger Subsection (1) or (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.436" offset="5080729">And, again, there's no reason to think that there's a greater anomaly with respect to Subsection (6).</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.905" offset="5094626">The other thing I would say is that in this case, (3) and -- if it arose in connection with a transaction that occurred today, (3) and (6) would be coterminous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.433" offset="5136736">Either of them would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.336" offset="5140288">But there will be plenty of cases in which a substantial valuation misstatement penalty on our view could be triggered by a legal error in computing basis, such as use of the wrong depreciation rate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1421.052" offset="5791155">The -- the thing that subjects them to potential penalties is the fact that they claimed a large loss on their tax returns and they did that by claiming a large false basis in the -- the partnership.</text>

            <text syncTime="1447.932" offset="5898675">And in essence, when the code says impose penalties on underpayments that are attributable to the following things, it says -- it means we're going to look at your work.</text>

            <text syncTime="1529.587" offset="6225311">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.601" offset="6237327">On both jurisdiction and the merits, the Government is asking this Court to adopt an overly expansive interpretation of the code to reach a result that would upset the statutory scheme devised by Congress and lead to further problems down the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.689" offset="6285706">Now, on jurisdiction, I think the most important thing for the Court to recognize is that outside basis, the very thing, as you can tell from my friend's arguments on the merits, that the imposition of this penalty depends on is not a partnership item.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.715" offset="6345787">In fact--</text>

            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="1560.715" offset="6349862">Mr. Garre, it seems as though you and the Government agree on sort of the nature of this problem, right?</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.587" offset="6369297">Which is you have a partnership item, which is the sham determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.258" offset="6375985">That leads to an adjustment in outside basis which, as you just said, is not a partnership item, is instead an affected item; and that leads to a penalty, right?</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.503" offset="6428961">So there's kind of three things, two steps in the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.532" offset="6441082">And you say, well, that's not enough, essentially because the penalty has to directly relate to a partnership item.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.123" offset="6475459">And they say it is enough because it's okay if it indirectly relates to the partnership item.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.105" offset="6503358">And I guess the question is: In some sense you're both adding adjectives to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.103" offset="6519345">You add directly, they add indirectly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.868" offset="6534391">How do we pick between those?</text>

            <text syncTime="1609.227" offset="6543900">--Well, I think the Government is asking the Court to add a great deal more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.834" offset="6558319">Just to go to the statutory text, with the provision at 6226, and it's on page 2A of the red brief, and what that says is that first it gives the Court jurisdiction to determine all partnership items.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.686" offset="6629686">Everybody agrees that outside basis is not a partnership item.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.825" offset="6642225">And then it gives jurisdiction to the Court to determine penalties that relate to partnership items.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.759" offset="6670019">And what -- and what the Government is asking this Court to do is essentially to read this to say that relates to partnership items or that relates to non-partnership affected items, like outside basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.145" offset="6719547">And the reason why the Court shouldn't do that is, first, in a scheme that divides the worlds into partnership items that can be determined at the partnership level and non-partnership items that must go to the partner level, when Congress says “ partnership item ”, that's significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.718" offset="6773882">It -- it adds defined terms of “ non-partnership item ” or “ affected item ”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.108" offset="6787361">It said “ partnership item ”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.013" offset="6791018">So we think that it necessarily excluded non-partnership affected items here and that's the way to read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.010" offset="6819022">And second, if you read the “ relates to ” as broadly as the Government says, then it makes no sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.789" offset="6842114">The partnership item here might as well say “ affected item ” because you're right, at some level of abstraction, you can always say that the penalty relates to the partnership item.</text>

            <text syncTime="1732.613" offset="7037405">Justice Scalia, let me answer it this way: Partnerships can do many things, just like individuals and corporations, and they can engage in things that subject -- that trigger penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.203" offset="7079724">A partnership can misreport its income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.795" offset="7090173">A partnership can make a valuation misstatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.294" offset="7100099">A partnership can engage in negligence, and the court can determine those -- the applicability of those penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.322" offset="7128207">Now it's true that down the road in -- in a mathematical adjustment, the court is looking to whether or not the partner repeated that error on its return.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.117" offset="7163420">But what's fundamentally different about this case is the penalty depends not on the partnership, just the partnership item; it depends on this outside basis determination that a court can't make.</text>

            <text syncTime="2397.173" offset="9695626">The noneconomic substance penalty that Congress passed to cover this situation here solves all the problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.936" offset="9718718">As to jurisdiction, courts could determine it at the partnership level because looking to whether or not the partnership is a sham is a partnership item.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.495" offset="9752991">And so courts have jurisdiction to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.214" offset="9759782">And of course that solves the merits question, too, because Congress actually addressed the situation here on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.665" offset="9781621">Instead we have the government trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.930" offset="9798653">I mean, on jurisdiction, before I go to the merits, I just want to talk about the practical consequences of this ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.724" offset="9821849">It's very significant from the standpoint of the taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.692" offset="9829686">What the government wants to do is funnel all these penalty determinations into a computational adjustment as opposed to the deficiency proceeding, which is a default rule under the statute, Section 6230.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.952" offset="9878796">And from the taxpayers' perspective, that has huge consequence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.170" offset="9891648">It means that the taxpayers have to pay the refund up front, as Justice Sotomayor recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.464" offset="9916831">That means that, even in disputed penalties, they've got to pay all that up front.</text>

            <text syncTime="2457.508" offset="9936997">It means they can't go to the Tax Court to challenge it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3119.696" offset="12585709">The most common situation in which basis misstatements are made, the Government acknowledges throughout its brief, is where you misstate the price or cost of a good.</text>

            <text syncTime="3250.328" offset="13108262">And that's because of the canon that this Court has recognized that tax penalties are strictly construed in favor of the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.342" offset="13140341">Here, at a bare minimum, there is ambiguity as to whether the Congress that passed the valuation misstatement penalty ever intended it to apply to this fundamentally different situation where no one disagrees about the numbers reported on the return.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.741" offset="13201885">Again, if you go to the partnership return, the transactions are accurately reported.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.896" offset="13218499">If you go to the outside bases, it's true that they reported a loss, but that's because they were following the IRS' rules about how you treat contingent liabilities.</text>

            <text syncTime="3291.220" offset="13271893">That's why the IRS has to come up with a sham to get rid of the property altogether and say that we are going to pretend that it doesn't exist at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="3300.948" offset="13310764">When the penalty talks about correct amounts, about accuracy, about value, it's trying to get at the number that the thing is worth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.134" offset="13335528">It is not concerned with a situation in which the IRS is claiming that the property doesn't exist at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="3315.708" offset="13369800">Congress addressed it in a direct way, in a noneconomic substance penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.207" offset="13387773">So this Court doesn't have to worry about this problem being unaddressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.207" offset="13399789">But what it should do is correctly interpret the penalty that Congress enacted, which was on the books when these events occurred, which is the valuation misstatement penalty and not the all-encompassing basis overstatement penalty.</text>

            <text syncTime="3514.740" offset="14165908">It would have been absolutely clear that the transaction, taken as a whole, was a wash.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.567" offset="14185239">The only way that they could try to create the appearance of a paper loss was by manipulating the rules that govern the computation of basis in partnerships.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.938" offset="14222751">And so the shamming determination, in effect, was a determination that, for tax purposes, you can't try to take advantage of the Helmer rule that says that, for computing basis in a partnership, we will ignore the -- the contingent liability created by the short option.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.071" offset="14291296">The -- the one thing -- other thing I would say on the merits as to why we care about this case is that Respondent's argument doesn't just go to -- on -- on Subsection 3, doesn't just go to basis overstatements that are produced through sham transactions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3589.616" offset="14465376">Under Subsection 6 you are -- if you disclose the relevant information on your tax return, then even if it's later determined that the transaction lacked economic substance, you would be subject only to the 20 percent penalty.</text>
