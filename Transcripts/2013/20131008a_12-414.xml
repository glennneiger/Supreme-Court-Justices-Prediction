            <label>Mr. John J. Bursch</label>
            <text syncTime="7.870" offset="138948">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="11.022" offset="151487">No court has ever held that AEDPA and Strickland can be satisfied by presumption based on a silent record.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.212" offset="180326">Yet that is precisely the approach the Sixth Circuit adopted in granting habeas relief here.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.263" offset="200493">The record doesn't say how attorney Toca investigated or what advice attorney Toca gave, but based on that record silence, the Sixth Circuit assumed Toca was ineffective.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.304" offset="244692">And under AEDPA and Strickland, the presumptions run the opposite way.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.089" offset="259843">Now, if there's one thing that the Court takes away from the oral argument this morning, I hope that it's -- it's this: How upside down the Sixth Circuit's analysis is when it says on Page 19A of the petition appendix that Toca was deficient because the record contains no evidence that he advised Titlow about elements, evidence, or sentencing exposure.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.920" offset="339151">The correct question is whether the record contains evidence that Toca did not do those things.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.923" offset="359108">And that record silence is dispositive in favor of the State on habeas review.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.025" offset="375513">Now, if we could pull the curtain back and see what really happened here, it may be the case that Toca gave the proper advice, that he advised Titlow about all the perils of going to trial, and that Titlow continued to maintain her innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.285" offset="428594">Under Strickland, we're supposed to presume that Toca did exactly that, especially when it's Titlow's burden to satisfy the burden of proof, and she failed to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.724" offset="466315">So I'd like to begin with our first issue, which is AEDPA deference and the performance prong of Strickland.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="95.378" stopTime="118.577">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="95.378" offset="488989">May I just ask a question about what you just said?</text>
            <text syncTime="98.514" offset="501528">The record does show that Toca came into the case very late in the day, and he asked to have a postponement because he said, I have to get up to speed.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.487" offset="553355">I don't know anything about this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.023" offset="559520">So Toca himself is saying, I'm not acquainted with the case -- with the case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_j_bursch" startTime="118.577" stopTime="154.166">
            <label>Mr. John J. Bursch</label>
            <text syncTime="118.577" offset="581776">Well, I don't think he's -- he's saying that, Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.779" offset="594524">He's saying I'm not prepared for trial yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.712" offset="602256">But he says, I've got a lot of materials here.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.081" offset="611765">He goes through a very sophisticated sentencing analysis with the -- the sentencing court in this plea withdrawal hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.218" offset="636320">If you understand Michigan sentencing, if you've got a manslaughter charge, there's a grid.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.205" offset="652307">And there's all kinds of different boxes that this could have fit into, and he would have had to have analyzed the evidence in order to determine that the two to five range was appropriate for a manslaughter conviction, and to be able to then negotiate with the prosecutor about whether that was or was not appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.381" offset="713015">And so we know that -- that Toca did a lot of work.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="154.166" stopTime="163.272">
            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="154.166" offset="724091">Was the sentence that was ultimately imposed after the trial for the second-degree murder conviction within the guidelines, within the Michigan guidelines?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_j_bursch" startTime="163.272" stopTime="163.989">
            <label>Mr. John J. Bursch</label>
            <text syncTime="163.272" offset="760558">Yes, it was.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="163.989" stopTime="165.891">
            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="163.989" offset="763379">What -- do you know what those guidelines were?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_j_bursch" startTime="165.891" stopTime="241.789">
            <label>Mr. John J. Bursch</label>
            <text syncTime="165.891" offset="771007">I don't recall, but it's something on the range of 15 to 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.462" offset="793264">And when we're talking about guidelines, it's important for the Court to understand the difference between what the guidelines called for, for manslaughter and what was in the plea agreement, because Michigan's got this indeterminate sentencing system where you've got a range for the lower end.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.071" offset="851778">And so the plea deal was 7 to 15 years on the lower end.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.423" offset="865153">And a manslaughter conviction -- that is, if they had gone to trial and lost for manslaughter, the lower end was 2 years to 5 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.410" offset="893051">And so it was entirely reasonable, from an objective perspective, for an attorney, looking at this record at the time the plea was withdrawn, to say, yes, if you want to maintain your innocence, the most likely bad result at trial is most likely better than the plea deal that you already have.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.003" offset="951461">Sure, there's a risk that something worse could happen, but this Court has said in Strickland and Lafler and other places that bad predictions are not deficient performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.193" offset="984166">And so really, when you get down to it, it's really a problem with both the advice being reasonable, but also the failure to carry the burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.548" offset="1017603">It's just the case that Titlow has not come forward to demonstrate, as he was required to do -- she was required to do on the record what Titlow -- or what Toca did to investigate and what advice Toca actually gave to Titlow.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="241.789" offset="1074550">When we're asking whether the advice was reasonable, what force do we give to the proposition that a well-counselled defendant was now insisting that he wanted to change his plea?</text>
            <text syncTime="258.151" offset="1140065">And there was only three days.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.853" offset="1150828">How do we factor that in?</text>
            <text syncTime="262.972" offset="1159291">If -- if we look at the gist of what the counsel did--</text>

            <label>Mr. John J. Bursch</label>

            <text syncTime="266.256" offset="1172457">I think that's an important factor.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="267.623" stopTime="279.164">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="267.623" offset="1177890">--it may lead us to one answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.708" offset="1186250">But if we know that a previously well-counselled defendant had now changed his mind and wanted to withdraw, how do we factor that in?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_j_bursch" startTime="279.164" stopTime="331.199">
            <label>Mr. John J. Bursch</label>
            <text syncTime="279.164" offset="1224075">I think that's a significant factor because, as you point out, before the ink was even dry on the plea agreement, Titlow was already in prison saying, I'm innocent.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.337" offset="1256780">Maybe I should be withdrawing this plea, setting in motion a chain of events that resulted in her firing the first attorney and then hiring a second attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.591" offset="1285828">And I don't think that the court of appeals, the Michigan Court of Appeals, articulated any kind of a -- a per se rule about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.097" offset="1311846">You know, certainly we all understand that the ethical obligation of the lawyer is that if your client insists that they want to maintain their innocence, you have to allow them to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.933" offset="1343193">But what the court of appeals did, at pages 100 to 101A of the petition appendix, it looked at that.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.754" offset="1370465">But it also looked at the other evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.706" offset="1378302">It looked at the Strickland presumption that Toca did his job.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.141" offset="1391990">And then it says at the very conclusion of that sentence, based on all the proofs and arguments presented, Titlow failed to satisfy her burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.580" offset="1425740">This instance is one part of that.</text>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="331.199" offset="1432219">Could you explain the procedural situation before the Michigan Court of Appeals?</text>
            <text syncTime="336.520" offset="1453535">There was a motion by the Respondent for a remand to the trial court to create a record; is that -- that correct--</text>

          <turn speaker="john_j_bursch" startTime="345.708" stopTime="346.392">
            <label>Mr. John J. Bursch</label>
            <text syncTime="345.708" offset="1490315">That's correct.</text>

          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="346.392" stopTime="358.266">
            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="346.392" offset="1493032">--on the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel?</text>
            <text syncTime="348.910" offset="1503063">And so the -- the question that the court of appeals had to decide was whether the materials that were submitted by the Respondent were sufficient to justify the hearing.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_j_bursch" startTime="358.266" stopTime="358.999">
            <label>Mr. John J. Bursch</label>
            <text syncTime="358.266" offset="1540470">That's correct.</text>

          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="358.999" stopTime="393.772">
            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="358.999" offset="1543396">And the court of appeals, I gather, said they're not sufficient and cited, among other things or principally, the fact that the Respondent had claimed innocence, and that was the reason for the change of attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.228" offset="1616330">So the issue really wasn't -- that was before them was really not entitlement to relief, but in the course of deciding whether there should be a remand, they necessarily got to the issue of whether there was an entitlement to relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.570" offset="1673695">Is that -- is that correct or do I not understand?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_j_bursch" startTime="393.772" stopTime="476.593">
            <label>Mr. John J. Bursch</label>
            <text syncTime="393.772" offset="1682576">Just to be clear about Michigan procedure, the defendant has an opportunity to a right to ask for what's called a Ginther hearing in Michigan, and that's an evidentiary hearing to develop a record for an ineffective assistance claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.645" offset="1717998">Titlow did not ask for that hearing in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.664" offset="1730119">She did ask for it in the Michigan Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.532" offset="1741613">But under the Michigan court rules -- this is 7.211(C)(1)(a)(2) -- she was required to make a proffer to justify that hearing on this motion to remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.638" offset="1777975">And so the court of appeals, before it issued its merits opinion, issues a one-sentence order that says: The Motion to remand is denied because you have not proffered enough evidence to demonstrate that a hearing is warranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.612" offset="1821861">And that makes sense because the only proffer was the polygraph, Lustig affidavit and the Pierson affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.933" offset="1847148">It would be entirely appropriate -- this often happens -- that Titlow herself would have submitted an affidavit saying: This is what Titlow knew -- I'm sorry: This is what Toca knew, this is what Toca advised, and I relied on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.741" offset="1890406">Or sometimes it's even the case that the previous defense counsel is willing to submit the affidavit that says: This is what I knew, this is the advice that I gave.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.895" offset="1923007">None of that was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.847" offset="1926873">And so that's why you have this denial of the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.913" offset="1935128">So now in the context of that record and, Justice Kennedy, the claim of innocence and this whole thing being set in motion by that claim of innocence, it was quite easy for the Michigan Court of Appeals to say that, on the proofs presented and in light of the Strickland presumption, there was nothing objectively unreasonable about allowing Titlow to recall her plea.</text>

            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="476.593" offset="2013809">In just thinking about that Michigan Court of Appeals decision, there is one sort of troubling line in it to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.497" offset="2033453">It says:</text>
            <text syncTime="482.380" offset="2037006">"When a defendant proclaims his innocence, it is not objectively unreasonable to recommend that the defendant refrain from pleading guilty no matter how good the deal may appear. "</text>
            <text syncTime="492.703" offset="2078279">And one way to read this is it's a kind of categorical rule which says that when the defendant says he is innocent, basically your obligations to properly advise him about a plea go away.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.178" offset="2124150">Now, I understand you not to read it that way.</text>

            <text syncTime="515.151" offset="2168036">I think it would be very difficult to defend the opinion if that was the only sentence of analysis, because we do not agree that a simple claim of innocence by your client relieves the attorney of any responsibility to do anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.959" offset="2215265">That's not what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.826" offset="2218713">Four sentences before the sentence you just read on Page 101A, the court of appeals talks about the Strickland presumption that the attorney is doing his or her job.</text>

            <text syncTime="572.771" offset="2398540">We don't even know that, because we don't have credible evidence in this record.</text>

            <text syncTime="602.474" offset="2517345">The U.S. -- the district attorney says: This lawyer was adequate and really two factors make that obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.682" offset="2570217">The first factor is that the client said that she was innocent and, taking that into account with the other things, that could have justified adequately his withdrawal of the plea and not convincing her not to.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.428" offset="2645136">Second, the sentence that the district attorney wanted to give was more than a year greater than the guidelines for manslaughter, and that could have justified it.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.753" offset="2698426">Now, it writes -- the court then writes in its opinion only the second reason and never mentions the first.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.092" offset="2727788">Now we go to habeas and the habeas court thinks that second reason is pretty flimsy there.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.929" offset="2759135">Gee, she was exposing herself to murder, et cetera; it's pretty flimsy.</text>

            <text syncTime="690.598" offset="2869789">And I want to start with a record response to distinguish our case from your hypothetical and then address the habeas question.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.467" offset="2889329">Your hypothetical assumed that the State court only mentioned one of the two reasons, and here obviously the court of appeals talked about innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.573" offset="2917750">We've discussed that at length.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.806" offset="2922661">But on page 100A of the opinion, the court of appeals also notes that the defendant moved to withdraw her plea because the agreed-upon sentence exceeded the sentencing guidelines range.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.845" offset="2958815">So they are both here.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.628" offset="2961949">But assuming your hypothetical that we only had one and not two, the question is really easy under 2254, because so long as the decision was not a misapplication of this Court's clearly established precedent, there is no violation even if their reasoning might not have been as strong as it could have been had they mentioned the other reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.925" offset="3039167">So next habeas question: Does the defendant get an opportunity to have a Federal habeas hearing to further develop the record about what happened?</text>
            <text syncTime="741.031" offset="3071559">And the answer is no, because under 2254(e)(1) and (e)(2) there is a presumption of correctness about everything that was found in the State court system.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.904" offset="3107086">And there is no right to get a Federal evidentiary record if you have not adequately pursued your ability to develop the record in the State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.290" offset="3136656">And as Justice Alito has already pointed out, it was Titlow's failure, not the State's failure, to properly proffer evidence to get the Ginther hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="782.275" offset="3236548">The defendant could believe in her heart of hearts that she's innocent and at the same time the attorney could acknowledge that there are facts in the record already admitted that a reasonable jury could conclude that you were guilty of manslaughter.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.499" offset="3285450">And so it would not be inconsistent for that attorney to argue for a lower guidelines range in the plea.</text>

            <text syncTime="874.781" offset="3606547">He had -- you know, the quote from the plea withdrawal hearing is “ a lot of materials ”, and he made a very sophisticated argument about what the guidelines range should be and that range was lower than the plea actually offered.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.637" offset="3650015">But what you need to understand about this testimony from Titlow right here, this was a plea for leniency at sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.207" offset="3676241">This was not part of the proffer to the Michigan Court of Appeals as part of the motion for remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.877" offset="3698916">What Titlow could have done was submit her own affidavit or the affidavit from Toca establishing whether this was actually true or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.550" offset="3729636">In addition, you've got to take the context of this and juxtapose it against the other things that Titlow was saying at this very same sentencing hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.256" offset="3764431">And it's remarkable really that she says both of these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.791" offset="3782612">She says she feels sorry for her Aunt Billie for being this manipulating and evil person and thanks God that she did not do what Billie asked her to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.547" offset="3813646">And she says it was only because of her, Titlow, that the truth came out.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.832" offset="3826811">So somehow it's still a claim of innocence, even after trial, even after there has been a conviction.</text>

            <text syncTime="955.063" offset="3927748">There are two primary points that the United States would like to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.584" offset="3941750">First, when evaluating Strickland prejudice in the context of a rejected plea offer, the statement of a convicted defendant that she would have accepted the plea absent sufficient advice should be viewed with skepticism and to support a finding of causation, the statement should be judged based on all the objective circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.860" offset="4010922">Second, when a Federal habeas court finds a Sixth Amendment violation in the rejected plea context, it should not categorically require the government to reoffer a rejected plea deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.501" offset="4053450">That decision should be left to the sentencing court, and requiring the government to reoffer a rejected plea deal in a context like this case where the plea agreement required the defendant to do something other than plead guilty -- give testimony against her aunt -- it doesn't make sense, and the government should not be required to make the reoffer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.295" offset="4128578">Every defendant who rejects a plea offer and then is convicted after a trial will have an incentive and will want to revert back to a plea deal that she rejected beforehand.</text>

            <text syncTime="1035.565" offset="4249681">What you base it on is the internal consistency and logic of the testimony and how it's corroborated by circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.873" offset="4294926">And he said, otherwise, you just rarely hear anybody say, story makes sense, nothing -- story doesn't make sense, the story's not corroborated, but the guy looks like he's telling the truth.</text>

            <text syncTime="3280.510" offset="13229535">You have to file a motion to remand and the court of appeals specifically references that motion to remand and the proffer by the affidavit in stating that normally they wouldn't consider those, that proffer as substantive of evidence, but in this case inexplicably, they did, which leads to another reason why the Michigan Court of Appeals decision is unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.757" offset="13314485">Because the Michigan Court of Appeals failed to engage in further fact finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.644" offset="13334024">So we take the record as we get it from them and under Williams and other decisions, if the Court is the one responsible for an inadequate record, and we would have what we have, and I would argue to this Court that the record that we had supports that the Michigan Court of Appeals erred both legally and factually in its findings and therefore neither are entitled to any deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.510" offset="13425453">And the Sixth Circuit habeas should be affirmed in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.312" offset="13444679">Thank you.</text>

            <label>Mr. John J. Bursch</label>
            <text syncTime="3340.449" offset="13469234">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.471" offset="13497342">A few clean-up points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.421" offset="13501104">Starting with this idea that the actual predicate was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.939" offset="13515210">As we explained in our briefing in the habeas pleadings in this very case, Titlow already conceded that the factual predicate was correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.212" offset="13544258">And Justice Breyer, you asked about the quantum of proof necessary to overcome that assumption that the Court of Appeals made based on the record before it and actually, the legal standard under AEDPA is not clearly wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.253" offset="13588457">Under 2254(e)(1), which is reprinted in our blue brief, it is presumed correct and that presumption could only be overcome by clear and convincing evidence, and we don't have that here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.026" offset="13627536">Second, with respect to the advice, my friend on the other side points to Paragraph 8 of the Pierson affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.029" offset="13651569">And it's a little ironic that they put all their eggs in that basket now because in their briefing they disclaim it as triple hearsay and say this Court should not rely on it and she said some things characterizing that paragraph that aren't in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.320" offset="13696708">There is nothing in paragraph 8 or the rest of the affidavit that says Toca approached Titlow.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.724" offset="13718338">I don't think where that comes from.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.991" offset="13723458">But assume that everything that she says is correct and that Toca did give the advice to withdraw the plea, that still doesn't mean that it's bad advice when you apply the AEDPA and Strickland rubrics because, as Justice Alito pointed out, the differentiation in the manslaughter guidelines and what was actually in the plea actually makes this objectively reasonable advice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.737" offset="13806423">And, in fact, it's more than that, because at the time the plea was withdrawn, consider all the facts that were known from talking to the prosecutor, looking in the police file and everything else that -- that Toca presumably did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.029" offset="13851562">At that time, no one knew about this critical Chahine testimony, which only came out at trial, that it was actually Titlow who held Uncle Don down while he was being smothered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.920" offset="13895135">I mean, that completely changes the complexion of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.437" offset="13905166">And so to say that Titlow was always guilty when all of her testimony up to the point of the plea withdrawal had been, I told my Aunt Billie to stop and then I left the scene, that's just not credible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.311" offset="13948738">Point on the second issue, the prejudice prong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.529" offset="13961590">Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Sotomayor, you note that the other circuits all look at objective evidence and we think that's the right way to approach this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.035" offset="13991579">And you're exactly right, Chief Justice, that the Sixth Circuit takes a different approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.254" offset="14008506">The Sixth Circuit says, although some circuits have held that a defendant must support his own assertion that he would have accepted the offer with additional objective evidence, we, in this circuit, have declined to adopt such a requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.228" offset="14052392">And you can see how that difference played out in this very case, because the Sixth Circuit didn't look at all the other evidence that was in the record that was contrary to this self-serving statement that Titlow made; that Titlow had the plea in hand, and before the ink was even dry, was already professing innocence and talking to other lawyers; that she fired Lustig and there was no reason to do that unless she wanted to -- to withdraw the plea; that she did not have a propensity for truthfulness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.243" offset="14148418">At trial, she lied about the fact that she was drunk when she was not the night of the murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.481" offset="14169420">The evidence came out that she asked Chahine to lie about the alibi, and she hid the murder weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.385" offset="14193035">And then you've got all these statements at the sentencing hearing and post remand where she's continually asserting her innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.872" offset="14214978">It's happening all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.755" offset="14218426">When you consider all that objectively, under the other circuit standards, clearly, that would not be sufficient to establish prejudice here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3558.091" offset="14339843">Here's the connection, Justice Sotomayor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.593" offset="14345799">The reason they didn't look at the other evidence is because they have a different rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.212" offset="14360323">They don't think they have to look at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.914" offset="14367115">They did look at things like sentencing disparities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.530" offset="14377564">As the Solicitor General's office explained, that shouldn't come into play here because that was a well-known disparity; it wasn't something that was hidden by client's ineffective assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.370" offset="14412881">And they -- the Sixth Circuit talks about the fact that she accepted the plea once and then withdrew it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.840" offset="14430854">Obviously, that cuts both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.407" offset="14437123">So all you are left with is the subjective testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.309" offset="14448721">And when you look at all the other objective evidence, the evidence that other circuits would look at, there's really only one possible outcome here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.747" offset="14478397">So in sum, Your Honors -- oh, I guess I do want to mention one other quick point since my light hasn't gone yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.651" offset="14506086">The book deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.420" offset="14509117">There was no book deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.220" offset="14512356">Look at page Joint Appendix 60, and I've seen copyright assignments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.241" offset="14532418">That wasn't the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.257" offset="14536493">They were trying to raise money for the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.891" offset="14542971">And -- and this case had nothing to do with the reason why Toca was disbarred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.728" offset="14558331">That's at Joint Appendix 302 to 317.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.430">It was because he falsely put someone else's license tabs on his license plate and that was a misdemeanor and then he lied about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.167">In sum, record silence under AEDPA and Strickland means the State wins, not the convicted murderer.</text>
