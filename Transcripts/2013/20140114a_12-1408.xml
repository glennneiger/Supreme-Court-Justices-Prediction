            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="107199">We will hear argument next in Case 12-1408, United States v. Quality Stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="4.702" offset="126007">Mr. Feigin.</text>

            <label>Mr. Eric J. Feigin</label>
            <text syncTime="7.029" offset="135307">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="9.731" offset="146069">The payments in this case fall squarely under FICA's definition of wages, which includes all remuneration for employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.260" offset="176162">Consistent with the purpose of FICA to fund the Social Security and Medicare programs, this Court has construed the term "employment" broadly to encompass the entire employer-employee relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.458" offset="220988">The payments here, which were paid only to Respondent's employees and were keyed to the employees' positions, salary levels, and length of service, clearly were part of the employer-employee relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.344" offset="268531">Two particular features of the statute, I think, make especially clear that separation-related payments like this are covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.247" offset="296117">First, the basic definition of wages, both historically and currently, has been subject to specific exclusions for certain types of separation-related pay such as retirement pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.540" offset="345331">Those exclusions would be unnecessary if the basic definition of wages didn't cover separation-related payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.974" offset="371036">Second, one of the historical exclusions, which was in the statute from 1939 to 1950, was for certain types of dismissal payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.580" offset="409488">When Congress eliminated the exception for certain types of dismissal payments in 1950, the accompanying House report made clear what would already have been in any event implicit in the repeal itself, which is that from that point forward, all dismissal payments, which were -- Congress understood in the House report to include any payment on account of an employee's involuntary separation, would be considered wages under FICA.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.866" offset="514605">Respondent's reliance in this case on Section 3402(o) is misplaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.097" offset="539578">Section 3402(o) is a substantive rule of income tax withholding, but is expressly limited in its effect to Chapter 24, which is the income tax withholding chapter, and related procedural provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.749" offset="594121">It has no bearing on the definition of wages for purposes of FICA.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.638" offset="613661">In any event--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="127.464" stopTime="139.679">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="127.464" offset="617005">Well, don't we have a decision that says that the -- the term FICA purposes and income tax?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="eric_j_feigin" startTime="139.679" stopTime="333.429">
            <label>Mr. Eric J. Feigin</label>
            <text syncTime="139.679" offset="665906">--Well, two points about that, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.898" offset="674788">First of all, nothing in this Court's decision in Rowan suggests that this Court or any court needs to look to substantive rules of income tax withholding to determine the basic definition of wages for purposes of FICA.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.500" offset="729122">I think it's clear from the preamble to Section 3402(o) that Congress was focused on Chapter 24 and was trying to solve a specific problem within Chapter 24, the income tax withholding chapter, and it didn't intend to send essentially shock waves through the Internal Revenue Code that would affect the definition of wages in other chapters.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.478" offset="805086">Second, Respondent's view, I think, would undercut the basic principle animating Rowan, which is the idea that the definitions of wages should be congruent for purposes of administrability.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.533" offset="853256">Respondent's reading, which would say that none of the payments specified in Section 3402(o)(2)(a) can possibly be considered wages for FICA purposes, but nevertheless must be treated as wages for withholding purposes, would require employers to keep separate track of wages for the two different purposes and report them separately when they do W-2 forms for the employees or their own 941 tax returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.775" offset="954298">Now, Respondents have conceded that Section 3402(o) did not modify the preexisting definition of FICA or the income tax withholding chapter.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.926" offset="1002886">Instead, their argument seems to be that the definition of FICA, even before Section 3402(o) was enacted, contained a hole precisely the size and shape of the definition of supplemental unemployment compensation benefits that Congress later codified in Section 3402(o)(2)(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="245.494" offset="1089090">Now, they haven't pointed to a single statutory provision, regulation, or revenue ruling that would have given Congress that view.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.820" offset="1122422">There is simply no reason to believe that that hole existed before the enactment of Section 3402(o) and its common ground that it doesn't exist after Section 3402(o).</text>
            <text syncTime="264.379" offset="1164636">It's also important to understand why Congress enacted Section 3402(o).</text>
            <text syncTime="269.173" offset="1183862">Congress enacted Section 3402(o) in response to a suggestion by the Treasury Department in 1969 that there was a problem with supplemental unemployment benefit payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.276" offset="1232241">IRS itself had used in a series of revenue rulings that considered certain payments by employers that were intended to supplement State unemployment compensation benefits, and the IRS in those rulings had determined that those benefits were not wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.426" offset="1312802">Now, the IRS in 1969 informed Congress that because these benefits were considered non-wages, it was creating a problem, namely, that income taxes weren't being withheld and the recipients of the payments were receiving large income tax bills at the end of the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.731" offset="1374033">Congress enacted Section 3402(o) to address that specific problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.526" offset="1393259">It did not intend to modify the definition of wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.244" offset="1404126">It -- nothing in the Section 3402(o) can be taken as a commentary on the definition of wages that was enacted--</text>

            <text syncTime="368.101" offset="1579565">Why -- I might have missed a step here.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.382" offset="1588655">Why were they getting big tax bills if they're not wages?</text>

            <text syncTime="375.880" offset="1610703">Well, they were still considered to be income under the revenue rulings.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.174" offset="1627839">So the effect of that was that they were receiving pavements during the year that were considered income and as to which they would owe income tax, but the income tax wasn't being regularly withheld as -- as it is supposed to be on wages, and therefore at the end of the year, they'd receive a large income tax bill for those payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.543" offset="1697325">If the Court has no further questions, I'll reserve the balance--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="401.384" offset="1712685">I have a question about the effect of the government's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.118" offset="1727627">In the States, if these -- if we say these benefits qualify as wages for FICA purposes, then what about the States that say we supply unemployment compensation only if there is not another source of unemployment compensation?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="eric_j_feigin" startTime="432.622" stopTime="471.199">
            <label>Mr. Eric J. Feigin</label>
            <text syncTime="432.622" offset="1837655">--Your Honor, if the Court adopts the government's position in this case, there's not going to be any change in the States because the government's position is the status quo.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.666" offset="1869837">Now, there are certain States that do look to the Federal definition of "wages" in order to determine whether an individual qualifies for unemployment benefits under State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.631" offset="1909648">And if the Court were to reach some other conclusion in this case than the one the -- the government is urging, it is possible that there could be some effect in those States on qualification for State unemployment benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.499" offset="1957191">But since State unemployment benefit qualification is largely a matter of State law, the States could adjust to that however they saw fit.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="471.199" offset="1991986">Is it ever to the long-term advantage to the employee to have FICA withholding, so that the employee's account is greater and the benefits are greater?</text>

          <turn speaker="eric_j_feigin" startTime="479.697" stopTime="522.850">
            <label>Mr. Eric J. Feigin</label>
            <text syncTime="479.697" offset="2025945">So for -- certain employees may want that -- certain payments to count as wages because the definition of FICA purposes is identical to the definition of "wages" under the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.873" offset="2078608">And under the Social Security Act, the accrual of benefits is based on -- on wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.219" offset="2103999">So some employees may want to have earned more wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.202" offset="2119986">However, in this case, they're not making that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.700" offset="2141929">They're simply arguing that they shouldn't have to pay taxes on these payments which were made, again, only to employees, were keyed to the employees' positions, salaries and length of service and clearly meet FICA's definition of "wages".</text>

            <text syncTime="522.850" offset="2198562">What if the payments were not keyed to the length of service and to salary?</text>
            <text syncTime="526.536" offset="2213295">It was just a flat severance payment.</text>

            <text syncTime="536.454" offset="2253001">I think this case is even easier than that because the payments were clearly keyed to critical aspects of the employment relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.077" offset="2279437">Indeed, in the case of the post-petition payments, the payments were expressly conditioned on the employee's willingness to remain performing services for Respondents during the pendency of the bankruptcy proceedings.</text>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="555.821" offset="2330428">Well, in the Coffy case, the Court drew a distinction between compensation for services and payments that are contingent on the employee's being thrown out of work.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.629" offset="2369612">But that -- why doesn't that apply here?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="eric_j_feigin" startTime="567.550" stopTime="701.153">
            <label>Mr. Eric J. Feigin</label>
            <text syncTime="567.550" offset="2377344">So Coffy was addressing not FICA, but a statute that dealt with veterans' rights returning to work after a period of military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.797" offset="2414334">As construed by this Court, that statute drew a distinction between a reward for length of service, to which the returning veteran was entitled, and short-term compensation for services rendered to which the returning benefit -- returning veteran -- excuse me -- was not entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.010" offset="2479222">Now, that distinction doesn't exist under FICA.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.430" offset="2496881">Even if a particular payment is considered a reward for length of service, as this Court held that the payments in Coffy were, it would still be remuneration for services under FICA's definition of wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.597" offset="2553514">For example, if you were to give an employee an award after 20 years of service, that would clearly be a reward for length of service and would qualify as such under Coffy, but would not be remuneration for employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.964" offset="2614954">Now, the specific question you asked, Justice Alito, about the difference between payments that are part of the continuing employment and payments that occur at the end of the employment relationship, is also not a distinction that FICA draws.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.881" offset="2678693">As I said earlier, there are a number of historical and current exclusions for certain types of payments that are triggered by the end of the employment relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.611" offset="2709622">For example, from 1954 to 1983 the statute expressly excluded retirement pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.344" offset="2728535">I don't think there is a reasonable reading of the basic definition of FICA that would include retirement pay but exclude severance payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.060" offset="2767405">And again, I think it's very pertinent here, and probably the best piece of evidence we have in this case about congressional intent, that Congress from 1939 to 1950 excluded from the basic definition of FICA certain types of dismissal payments, by which it meant payments on account of involuntary separation; and then it eliminated that exclusion in 1950, making clear both as a statutory matter and it's clear in the legislative history that such payments, that is payments on account of involuntary separation, would from that point forward be covered as wages under FICA.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.046" offset="2899375">If the Court has no further questions, I will reserve my time.</text>

            <text syncTime="757.053" offset="3135313">It is our position that SUB payments is not remuneration for services because it is contingent, as indicated previously on the Coffy case, upon losing your job.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.893" offset="3178677">There is a problem on the public policy issue that the Government is telling the Court today, and the problem is if what they say is SUB pay is tied to State unemployment benefits, then it is not wages and subject to FICA.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.746" offset="3238131">They say if it's -- if you receive supplemental unemployment benefits but you do not receive State unemployment, then it is subject to FICA taxes and is wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.927" offset="3290899">So, what they are saying to the Court is if you have the ability to receive both the supplemental unemployment benefits and the State unemployment benefits, then we are not going to tax you with FICA taxes, but if you only receive less, being just the supplemental unemployment benefits, then it is going to be wages and then it's going to be subject to FICA taxes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1035.572" offset="4249383">And if you look as far back as 1960, when 501(c)(17) was enacted dealing with trusts and their exemption from the taxes, the definition of "supplemental unemployment benefits" has always had its own definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.860" offset="4314585">And it's always been treated -- in 1977, for example, the revenue ruling that the Government issued said that supplemental unemployment benefits of any kind are not -- are not -- wages and subject to FICA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.323" offset="4372472">In 1986 Congress reenacted the withholding statute and the FICA statute with the knowledge that 1977 revenue ruling was in place; and therefore, it's presumed that FICA taxes are not -- or that supplemental unemployment benefits are not subject to FICA taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.065" offset="4463379">The Government has stipulated that the payments made in this case to the Quality Stores employees met the definition of supplemental unemployment benefits.</text>

            <text syncTime="1784.255" offset="7244166">Saying that particular types of payments shall be treated as if they were wages made during a payroll period doesn't mean that it's categorically impossible for such payments to have qualified as wages to begin with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.391" offset="7292753">As Judge Bryson pointed out in the -- his opinion to the Federal Circuit in the CSX case, which is cited in our briefs, if you were to say to treat all men as if they were 6 feet tall, that wouldn't mean that no man could possibly be 6 feet tall.</text>

            <text syncTime="1832.361" offset="7436636">Second, I would point you to the part where it says,</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="1837.092" offset="7455548">Right.</text>

            <label>Mr. Eric J. Feigin</label>
            <text syncTime="1837.920" offset="7458788">And that actually has some significance in that it allows the employer to treat these as wages paid during the employer's normal payroll period, so the withholding can be performed in the same way that the employee would have withheld for normal payroll period payment and avoids the need to apply the rules that would govern in circumstances where payments are made outside of a payroll period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.036" offset="7551261">And these are payments that could well have been made outside a normal payroll period, but this directs that they be treated as payments within a payroll period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.128" offset="7579682">I would again point the Court back to the historical reason why 3402(o) exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.781" offset="7602252">It was enacted, as I discussed earlier, following a suggestion by the Treasury Department that there was a particular problem with withholding that needed to be solved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.966" offset="7643003">Now, Justice Scalia, I suppose Congress might have solved that problem in different ways, but I think what Congress did here is it simply tried to solve the problem once and for all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.194" offset="7683963">It just declared that these payments should be treated as if they were wages so that withholding would occur, thereby solving the problem that the IRS identified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.941" offset="7718863">And it enacted a definition of supplemental unemployment compensation benefits that everyone agrees is broader than the set of payments that the revenue rulings up to that point had accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.671" offset="7765883">And there are a couple of very good reasons Congress would have done it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.592" offset="7777481">One is that, because of the IRS's case-specific approach to each of its revenue rulings, it would have been difficult, if not impossible, for Congress to craft statutory language that precisely captured the contours of the payments that the IRS either was treating or might later treat as non-wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.052" offset="7847385">Second, again, the supplemental unemployment benefit plans that are evolved in the 1950s continued to evolve and take different forms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.051" offset="7879359">And I think the IRS just wanted to hedge against the possibility -- excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.408" offset="7896809">Congress wanted to hedge against the possibility that the IRS might later decide that a plan structured slightly differently from any plan that it had considered before should also be considered nonwages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.747" offset="7942157">And there was absolutely no downside to Congress writing the definition in 3402(o)(ii)(a) more broadly than the IRS rulings had thus far had an opportunity to construe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.176" offset="8011852">That's because, again as the Federal Circuit pointed out, there is no practical harm done if you treat -- if you are instructed to treat a particular payment as wages and that payment already is wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.342" offset="8072561">Now, Your Honor, to your point about surplusage, first of all, I don't think the canon against surplusage would help you construe FICA here because I think FICA is unambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.543" offset="8109341">I do not think there is any way to read the definition, 3402(o)(2)(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.146" offset="8175692">In any event, the only way this would be superfluous is if some court were to hold, on an issue that is not presented to the Court in this case, that the IRS has absolutely no administrative authority to craft administrative exceptions to the definition of wages for policy reasons, as it did in the revenue rulings that underlie the enactment of Section 3402(o) here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.307" offset="8272345">If a court were to reach that conclusion, then Section 3402(o) might not have any operative effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.742" offset="8298154">But Congress in 1969 clearly could not have believed that the revenue rulings were ineffective or it never would have enacted Section 3402(o) in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.880" offset="8338696">There's no other reason Congress could have thought that certain types of supplemental unemployment benefits were excepted from the definition of "wages".</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.954" offset="8367013">My friend on the other side mentioned these 1968 regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.124" offset="8383627">Those regulations only applied to payments from trusts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.779" offset="8398255">They didn't apply to payments, like the payments at issue in this case, that come directly from the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.012" offset="8419153">Those regulations did not purport to construe the definition of FICA or the income tax withholding statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.119" offset="8447575">And in fact, since 1957 there has been an income tax withholding regulation that specifically says that any payment on account of an employee's involuntary separation does constitute wages for withholding purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.706" offset="8497939">And Congress was presumably aware of that regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.674" offset="8509850">And again, I would just like to address one final point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.546" offset="8541302">I think opposing counsel's argument about this 1986 reenactment doesn't make a great deal of sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.153" offset="8571708">I think the argument is that when Congress reenacted the statute in 1986 it was somehow adopting the then-current interpretation of the IRS in a 1977 revenue ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.976" offset="8615072">I don't think that the enactment of Section 3402(o) originally in 1969 can be taken to have left the IRS with sufficient flexibility to change its practices during the 1970s, but that the reenactment of that very same language in 1986 would be taken to freeze for all time and -- the current IRS practices and foreclose the IRS from ever modifying those practices in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.793" offset="8722278">Finally, Respondents point to the legislative history of 3402(o), which does contain some statements that supplemental unemployment compensation benefits aren't wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.148" offset="8763761">I think some of the reason for that legislative history is confusion about the nomenclature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.007" offset="8783196">There were IRS used.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.877" offset="8814647">I think it is clear that Congress must have been looking at the IRS revenue rulings, again because there is simply nothing else that could have possibly given the IRS the impression that any of these types of payments weren't wages to begin with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.513" offset="8865220">And I think it's very important that the Court not just look at the legislative history piecemeal, but look at the entire historical backdrop if it decides to get into any of that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.400" offset="8900747">But we think this case is very easily resolved on the plain text of FICA, which clearly includes these payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.055" offset="8919346">We don't even think there is a need to look at Section 3402(o), which is limited in effect to the income tax withholding provisions and was enacted to solve a specific income tax withholding-related problem and not to affect FICA's basic definition of wages.</text>

            <text syncTime="2259.735" offset="9146089">Well, I think part of the -- the point is that the broad, capacious definition of IRS since they are carving things out, maybe not willy-nilly, but at least they don't seem that it's as broad as you do -- they don't seem to think that it's as broad as you do.</text>

            <text syncTime="2280.179" offset="9227904">First, again, these exceptions first came into existence in the 1950s and 1960s, and I quite candidly don't think the IRS was as careful about fidelity to text as a modern legal observer would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.001" offset="9287150">Second, if this Court were to believe that, notwithstanding the fact that the IRS's revenue rulings are indirectly at issue in this case for the reasons I said to Justice Ginsburg, if this Court believes that it cannot rule for the Government in this case on the statutory question without concluding that the revenue rulings are invalid, we still think the Court should rule for the Government on the statutory question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.853" offset="9374608">We think the statutory text is clear, and that is the IRS's position notwithstanding the revenue rulings.</text>

            <text syncTime="2332.019" offset="9435212">So if this Court were to conclude that the Government is correct on a -- as a statutory matter, but we're to make clear that revenue -- the current revenue ruling, Revenue Ruling 90-72 was invalid, that might have some effect on individuals' eligibility for unemployment benefits under State law in those States that incorporate the Federal definition of wages as part of the calculation for eligibility for State unemployment benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.836" offset="9542523">If that creates any bad results, States will be able to fix them, and I don't think that it should preclude this Court from holding what the plain text of FICA I think in this case requires.</text>
