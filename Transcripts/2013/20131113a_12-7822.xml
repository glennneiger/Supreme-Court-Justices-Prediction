            <text syncTime="7.137" offset="135126">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="9.939" offset="146306">The doctrine of third-party consent is best understood as establishing a rebuttable presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.343" offset="167936">When the police arrive at a house at which multiple people live, they can assume, according to social custom, that if one person grants consent to enter, that person is speaking for everybody who lives in the dwelling.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.465" offset="212448">But when somebody is present and tells the police officer that he refuses consent, that presumption is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.654" offset="241183">Then when the police full well know that one person doesn't have a delegated authority to speak for the others, they must respect the objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.743" offset="273470">And a failure to do so violates the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.279" offset="283710">In other words, Matlock already gives the police all of the benefit of the doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.814" offset="301787">Even when people are nearby and have a -- might have an interest in objecting, the police can assume, as this put -- as this Court put it in Randolph, that asking that other person wouldn't make a difference very often, and therefore, they can presume that they would also consent to the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.942" offset="366362">So all we're--</text>

            <text syncTime="205.599" offset="928935">One is, under Coolidge -- under the Coolidge case, she could simply go get the things in the closet and give it to the police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.539" offset="956729">And that would take care of the problem, as Justice Thomas pointed out in his separate opinion in Randolph.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.907" offset="974179">In addition, she may well be able to invite the police into the dwelling sometimes, but that's very different than what's going on here.</text>

            <text syncTime="227.631" offset="1017124">The husband has said, never, I don't want a policeman to step foot in my house, and it's not just the closet.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.737" offset="1053487">She wants the police to take a good look around.</text>

            <text syncTime="239.906" offset="1066130">Then I misunderstood.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.672" offset="1069264">In that case, it would violate the Fourth Amendment for the police to come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.908" offset="1082221">But I think the hypotheticals that one might think of and that can arise, as certainly the other side pointed out in the brief, leave out three very important things that I think you need to ask under the Fourth Amendment social customs analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.901" offset="1134153">The first is you need to remember that we're asking about whether a stranger -- because the police officer can step into the shoes of what a stranger would be allowed to do -- whether a stranger would feel like that was acceptable reason to come into the house, not just because they'd been invited by the wife but vis-a-vis what the objector had said.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.177" offset="1203220">And it's very different when you ask about a stranger as opposed to what the other side would like to say, a neighbor or--</text>

            <text syncTime="285.385" offset="1248047">I would never think of telling my co-tenant that she could not invite her friends or other people into the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.193" offset="1287335">And so I don't understand why the fact that one is a joint tenant is not the end of the analysis.</text>

            <text syncTime="311.118" offset="1350969">Remember what the objection said in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1788.746" offset="7261539">The second reason is that this Court in Kentucky v. King gave a very good response to this scenario and said if there is a Fourth Amendment violation in the run-up to -- there it was the exigent circumstances search -- so here in the run-up to the consent, the analysis is different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.380" offset="7360073">Here of course we have a legitimate arrest.</text>

            <text syncTime="1820.867" offset="7390061">Social expectations in this case would say someone wanted to give assistance to Ms. Rojas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.156" offset="7423184">Social expectations would say: I've just seen the objector, having abused her, being hauled away to jail.</text>

            <text syncTime="1858.909" offset="7542198">Mr. Karlin, don't you find that a little bit odd?</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.111" offset="7550976">I mean, this social expectations analysis applied to a case in which a police officer has power that no person, no stranger has.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.550" offset="7588696">The police officer has just put the man in handcuffs and taken him away.</text>

            <text syncTime="1877.121" offset="7615028">So it's a bit odd to say: Well, social expectations say that the stranger can walk into the house, you know, having just carted the person away.</text>

            <text syncTime="1893.099" offset="7678976">The social expectation was that -- sort of a tie-breaker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.950" offset="7694336">We know that under general law, co-tenant consent controls.</text>

            <text syncTime="1903.621" offset="7720980">But what do we do when someone is saying 〝 stay out ″?</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.823" offset="7729862">So the reason for using the social expectation question was to say what would a caller do, what would a visitor do, confronted with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.329" offset="7763821">And the question it was answering was: Would the person feel okay to enter?</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.066" offset="7782838">It didn't answer the second question of what happens after.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.768" offset="7797571">What happens after had already been answered by this Court in Matlock when it said the whole basis for the co-tenant consent is that it's shared authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="3195.196" offset="12887374">I'd -- I think I'd like to use as my jumping off point Justice Breyer's last question where he went through, I believe, the elements in his concurrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.551" offset="12916736">They're all present in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.001" offset="12926558">And -- and as to the test, the reasonableness test, if you have any qualms about that being the test, you can do the case even more narrowly and it would take care, again, of the vast majority of cases that have arisen post Randolph, and simply say the objection has to be valid so long as it's impossible for him to enforce it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.315" offset="13003776">So long as it's impossible for him to be physically present and enforcing it, through no voluntary action of his own, at least then the objection has to be valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.522" offset="13048602">And the lockbox example the other side gives, even that isn't available to Mr. Fernandez.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.926" offset="13074202">Once he objected and knew the police were interested in his dwelling, he didn't have an opportunity even to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.997" offset="13094577">If he had private papers -- remember, we have to think of all different kinds of cases that might arise for -- where the police were seeking consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.817" offset="13121849">He couldn't even take that--</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="3255.134" offset="13127073">So the cotenant has much less authority to allow people to enter if her other cotenant is -- is a criminal than if he's a law-abiding citizen?</text>

            <text syncTime="3288.324" offset="13259880">The law-abiding citizen says I'm going away for three days, don't let anybody in the house, but the cotenant can overcome that, but not in the case of the -- well, I'm interrupting your -- your rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="3305.000" offset="13326544">I don't think there's any reason to believe that the police could then think -- if somebody said, I object to you entering the dwelling and doing -- doing a -- a general search.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.540" offset="13360713">Now, I have a business trip next week for three days.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.908" offset="13370221">I want you to let -- you know, I still object and do not want any warrantless general searches of my home.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.176" offset="13387253">I think there, the police would have a hard time arguing that they had valid third-party consent from the person in the dwelling.</text>

            <text syncTime="3332.234" offset="13435527">So she can't right -- let anyone in the house, the police department, for 20 years.</text>

            <text syncTime="3338.423" offset="13460291">No, because I think once he's imprisoned, you might say he has a new domicile, Justice Breyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.292" offset="13479727">[Laughter]</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.744" offset="13489549">I think he's lost ownership control over that house.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.113" offset="13494982">But I think what this case reduces to, Justice Kennedy, to get back to your question, is really what respect is owed this Court's Randolph decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.969" offset="13530404">I think the questions have adequately pointed out that if you adopt the other side's position on the facts of this case where the police forcibly remove somebody to the dwelling, Randolph reduces to nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.590" offset="13572931">Literally nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.109" offset="13578992">It's also about what respect is owed to somebody invoking somebody's constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.061" offset="13598740">In another case last term, this -- a plurality of this Court went to lengths to explain how important it is that people invoke their constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.017" offset="13630610">And, presumably, when they do, the police need to respect it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.219" offset="13647433">We live in a constitutional system that deals with individual dignity, not just of homeowners, but of people who enforce -- who -- who raise their rights and they need to be respected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.427" offset="13692259">Now, you have left these -- you know, if there were insuperable practical problems to enforcing Randolph in this setting, maybe you would want to reduce it to nothing and effectively overrule it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.817" offset="13741787">But I don't think there's any good reason to do that because I think you have a very easy rule that will resolve almost all the cases that I've offered you, and it will deal with -- by exigent circumstances doctrine, by the warrant -- ease of getting a warrant, by Illinois v. McArthur, which lets the police bring somebody outside, all of those things can very easily deal, I think, with the concerns that the Court has before it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3434.469" offset="13844396">Counsel, I don't understand how you can say it would render Randolph a dead letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.271" offset="13859651">The -- Randolph was expressly limited to physical presence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.907" offset="13874176">It expressly acknowledged that it was formalistic, and even the concurring opinion said, quote,</text>

            <text syncTime="3451.263" offset="13911583">So what you're really arguing for is an extension of Randolph, not an undermining of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3460.702" offset="13949408">And so, yes, the facts of that case where somebody who's physically present, the facts of this case begin with somebody who's physically present, and I think this Court ought to treat its opinion as having some genuine meaning in the real world that you're not--</text>
