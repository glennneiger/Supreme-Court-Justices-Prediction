            <text syncTime="15.710" offset="168398">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="18.462" offset="179370">In promulgating the Transport Rule, EPA sought to protect the public health and to strike a fair balance between the competing interests of upwind and downwind States.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.317" offset="214792">EPA's analysis proceeded in three basic steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.369" offset="227017">First, EPA performed a screening analysis to determine which upwind States would be covered by the Transport Rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.689" offset="256274">And in order to do that, EPA first identified the downwind receptors that were in a state of nonattainment or had maintenance difficulties, and then it determined which upwind States were linked to those receptors.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.949" offset="309355">And in order to be linked to a downwind receptor, the upwind State had -- had to contribute 1 percent or more of the relevant National Air Quality -- Ambient Air Quality standard, or -- or NAAQS, to that downwind receptor.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.823" offset="360869">And any State that didn't contribute at least 1 percent to any of the downwind -- any of the relevant downwind receptors was determined not to contribute significantly to nonattainment at that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.231" offset="410501">Second, once the States that were to be covered by the Transport Rule had been identified, EPA set a State emissions budget for each State.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.820" offset="444878">And to do that, it performed computer modeling to determine, in addition to whatever emission control efforts were already going on, what additional emission reductions could be achieved by implementation of control measures available at various cost thresholds; and the thresholds ultimately selected were for NAAQS, $500 per ton.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.869" offset="537038">For SO2, the group 1 States were at a level of $2,300 per ton.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.125" offset="566087">The group 2 States were 5 -- $500 per ton.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.160" offset="578207">And the idea was let's see what emissions savings we can achieve if additional control measures are implemented up to those cost thresholds.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="127.266" offset="614570">Of course, those -- those savings would -- would not be evenly distributed among the upwind States, right?</text>
            <text syncTime="133.670" offset="640274">So some upwind States that are able to make those efficient changes will be carrying more than their burden of reducing the emissions that affect downwind States, right?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="malcolm_l_stewart" startTime="150.196" stopTime="208.985">
            <label>Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="150.196" offset="706312">Well, there -- there were two bases for distinguishing among the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.398" offset="719164">The first -- in terms of the $500 per ton threshold for the group 2 States versus the $2,300 per ton threshold; the way in which States were divided into those categories is that the States that were linked to the downwind receptors that had the most severe pollution problems were treated as group 1 States, and they were required to make greater pollution control efforts because they had some responsibility for the most serious problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.401" offset="835148">Now, I guess the point of your question would go to -- to the fact that even among States that were operating under constant cost control thresholds, a State that had already implemented cost measures up to that limit might have to do less in a sense, because it would have already taken the -- the steps that were required, at least as compared to an air quality only threshold.</text>

            <text syncTime="208.985" offset="941518">Well, I don't mind a State doing less.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.872" offset="957087">I think North Carolina said -- said that you can use those cost figures to do less, and that's not challenged here.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.478" offset="991464">But what the application of the cost factor means is that some States that can more efficiently make the changes will be required to do more than merely account for their proportion of the downwind harm.</text>

            <text syncTime="271.743" offset="1192503">Does -- does -- does the fact that you begin with what the statute says is each upwind State has to account for its -- its effect on the downwind States, but once having identified that effect, you -- you then say those upwind States that can make the reductions more efficiently have to make more reductions than they -- than their mere proportion of the harm requires.</text>

            <label>Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="303.680" offset="1320294">I think it would be the case that at least as -- yes, as compared to at least some air-quality-only measures, the use of cost would have the effect of distributing the burden in a somewhat different way than it would have if you considered air quality factors only.</text>

            <text syncTime="318.539" offset="1379749">Is the idea, Mr. Stewart, that the States that are required to do more are the States that haven't done much already?</text>

            <text syncTime="328.080" offset="1417887">That if -- if States have to do less in order to meet the $500 -- in order to be in a position where they've implemented all the cost -- all the emission control measures that are available at $500 per ton, if a particular State has to do less in order to achieve that, it's probably because that State has already implemented most of those measures on its own.</text>

            <text syncTime="366.539" offset="1571696">--Well, the statute says that each State will adopt measures that prevent sources within its borders from contributing significantly to downwind nonattainment.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.395" offset="1611089">And the purpose of the provision is not to allocate blame for an existing state of nonattainment or for prior pollution.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.917" offset="1645257">It's a device -- it's to devise a scheme that going forward will prevent nonattainment from occurring.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.670" offset="1668245">And the idea is if each State lives up to its obligation, and if the downwind States make commensurate commitments, then the problem will be solved.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.676" offset="1704294">And in terms of the language ‶ contribute significantly ″, I think there are -- there are various reasons to think that EPA reasonably construed that term to include a component of difficulty of achievement.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.770" offset="1760614">That is, in common parlance, we might say that dunking a basketball is a more significant achievement for somebody who is 5 feet 10 than for somebody who is 6 feet 10.</text>

            <text syncTime="492.786" offset="2076696">It's true that the missed half-court shot at the buzzer would, in one sense, contribute significantly, in that it was a but-for cause.</text>

            <text syncTime="637.064" offset="2653793">Following up on Justice Scalia about the statutory language and how you read it, I think, you know, most people, everybody, thinks that it's better to regulate with attention to costs than to regulate without attention to costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.440" offset="2711262">We have this, our Trucking Association decision where we said, well, notwithstanding that everybody agrees that regulating with attention to costs is better, when Congress says the opposite we have to go with the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.433" offset="2767269">And there we said Congress had said the opposite because it had talked about protecting the public health with an adequate margin of safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.754" offset="2796526">Now, I'm wondering, what does it take in a statute to make us say, look, Congress has demanded that the regulation here occur without any attention to costs?</text>
            <text syncTime="685.680" offset="2848248">In other words, essentially Congress has demanded that the regulation has occurred in a fundamentally silly way.</text>

            <text syncTime="692.017" offset="2873639">Well, in the case of the NAAQS I think it was -- it was not the case that requiring EPA to establish the NAAQS without reference to cause -- to cost, would call a silly result.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.260" offset="2934557">That is, the ambient air quality standards were supposed to be set based on public health criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.931" offset="2957231">And the court in -- in the same case, in American Trucking, said that, of course, you can consider costs in deciding what is the most efficient and appropriate way to implement those NAAQS.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.055" offset="3001744">And here I take your point that in order to conclude that Congress barred consideration of costs at the implementation stage, we would have to have very clear language and ‶ significant contribution ″ doesn't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.414" offset="3063184">And the other thing I would say in addition to the examples I've given of -- in common parlance, we use significance to refer to ease or difficulty of achievement, it's worth emphasizing that this is a provision of law and it's designed to help allocate the responsibility among different actors for alleviating a shared problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.245" offset="3150537">And, for example, suppose--</text>

            <text syncTime="763.197" offset="3158374">The problem is that that allocation among different actors is done State by State, and simply taking costs into account as determining who will do what simply eliminates the requirement that each State not be -- not be required to do more than its share of the pollution it's -- it's causing downstream.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.116" offset="3274044">It's the State-by-State requirement that makes it very difficult to think that all Congress wanted was the most efficient reduction of pollution no matter where that pollution came from.</text>

            <text syncTime="814.262" offset="3362547">--I mean, the first thing I would say is we -- we can accept the premise that each State should alleviate no more than its share and there still may be -- that each State should do no more than its share, and yet there still may be different ways of determining what a State's fair share is.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.074" offset="3429838">That is, one way would be to determine which States had been the greatest polluters in the past and say that the more pollution that had previously flowed from your borders, the greater your reduction obligation in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.549" offset="3479784">But another way would be to say in order to ensure that each of the States that have shared responsibility for the problem in the past bears its fair share, we will ask each State to undertake commensurate efforts as measured by the cost threshold.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.241" offset="3538508">For example, if it could be shown somehow that the generation of electric power inherently required the emission of some level of SO2 and NOx, that there was simply no way to -- to generate electricity through any technology known today without generating -- without emitting that minimum amount, I think we would certainly say, well, Congress didn't intend to bury in the good neighbor provision some prohibition against particular States generating electricity.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.495" offset="3655536">And EPA could -- and EPA or the States could reasonably determine that the unavoidable component of the emissions, the part that couldn't be avoided even with the best possible pollution control technology, that would be regarded as legally insignificant; that the only legally significant contribution would be contribution that could have been avoided.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.026" offset="3745607">Now, clearly, EPA has gone one step farther, because it hasn't just focused on emissions that couldn't be avoided at all, at least with -- without foregoing the generation of electric power.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.084" offset="3793881">It has said, we will treat as legally significant only the extra increment of emissions that comes after we've taken what we regard to be equitable and cost effective pollution control measures.</text>

            <text syncTime="963.828" offset="3960856">What the Court said in American Trucking is that in -- in setting the NAAQS, EPA was forbidden to consider cost, not because the statute said in so many words cost can't be considered, but because the criteria that were set out in the statute for what the NAAQS had to achieve simply couldn't be reconciled with consideration of costs.</text>

            <text syncTime="1051.302" offset="4310792">The first is that, as I mentioned before, the good neighbor provision is addressed in the first instance to the States.</text>

            <text syncTime="1884.579" offset="7643912">And I think that's an extraordinary standard for an administrative agency to deal with; that is, you know, it happens all the time that Federal agencies are given authority to regulate, to address one problem, and the regulation necessarily has spillover effects on other conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.058" offset="7717786">And so for instance, if a Federal agency was tasked with preventing the sale in interstate commerce of contaminated food, it might require inspections.</text>

            <text syncTime="1961.929" offset="7953306">And as your question indicated, there is also a mechanism by which a State can ask to have the Federal implementation plan replaced by a plan of its own devising.</text>

            <text syncTime="2184.824" offset="8844813">I mean, one of the ironic things about this case is that the only ill consequence of overcontrol is cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.162" offset="8874175">That is, this is not a situation in which there is some distinct public health benefit -- distinct public health problem, I'm sorry, that is caused if power plants are emitting too little NOx or SO2.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.006" offset="8929554">The only reason that people worry about overcontrol, about reducing emissions more than they need to be, is that it costs money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.493" offset="8959543">And if that's the problem to be avoided, it seems strange that EPA can't take account of costs in theorizing a solution.</text>

            <text syncTime="2251.885" offset="9113038">The third part of the process is that once each State's emissions budget has been quantified, with respect to each State the EPA essentially divides up the emissions that are allowed among the different power plants within the State's borders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.878" offset="9169045">And the way that it does that is it gives allowances to the various power plants that add up to the total number of tons of pollutants that are allowed to be emitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.685" offset="9212304">And it's important to emphasize that the States have not joined the industry's argument here that cost -- even the States on the other side of the case have not joined the industry's argument here that states that costs can't be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.160" offset="9262145">Those States are not quarreling with the methodology by which EPA quantified their State emission budgets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.830" offset="9288895">Those States are simply saying that once those had been quantified they should have been given an opportunity to determine on their own how the allowances should be allocated without EPA doing it first.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.455" offset="9335393">In some situations that might have been a rational way for EPA to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.276" offset="9354619">That is, the statute says that once the -- once EPA finds that a particular State has either failed to submit a good neighbor SIP or has, or EPA has disapproved the good neighbor SIP, once that happens, the statute says that EPA at any time within 2 years can promulgate its own Federal implementation plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.772" offset="9436643">And in some circumstances, it might be rational for EPA to wait the full 2 years and give additional guidance to States in order to give them every opportunity to devise compliance plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.878" offset="9481051">There were basically two reasons that EPA didn't do that here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.930" offset="9493277">The first is that it was subject to the D.C. Circuit's mandate in North Carolina, which said get something in place that works as soon as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.935" offset="9525251">And EPA felt constrained by that to act as quickly as it could.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.256" offset="9546567">And the second point worth emphasizing is that there are State sovereign interests on both sides of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.243" offset="9574570">It's true that by devising a Federal plan in the first instance EPA has intruded to a degree on the ability of the upwind States to decide how emissions allowances should be allocated among their own sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.336" offset="9634860">But the downwind States are subject to their own obligations to comply with the NAAQS within their own borders, and to the extent that they can't get relief from the upwind States their task is made more difficult.</text>

            <text syncTime="3077.639" offset="12416065">The EPA just has very substantial discretion under this statute as to what kinds of conversations it wants to have when, within that broad structure.</text>

            <text syncTime="3127.405" offset="12615118">But what they said, 15 years ago, was that the States need to wait for EPA to quantify the obligations in a rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="3745.524" offset="15087660">The private party Respondents are focused on the statutory limitations to the EPA's authority under the good neighbor provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3752.695" offset="15116291">And I'd like to begin by addressing the issue that my friend from the government focused on a lot, which is the use of cost, and to explain not only what we think the statute requires in this regard, but why, Justice Kagan, it would be neither silly nor dumb; or, Justice Sotomayor, crazy to read the statute the way we suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3770.824" offset="15188807">And we begin with the text of the statute, which authorizes the prohibition only of amounts that contribute significantly to nonattainment or interfere with maintenance in downwind locations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3780.614" offset="15227990">The focus of that language we think is quite clearly on the effects of a State's emissions on other States, and not on the cost of reducing them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3788.351" offset="15258919">What EPA has done here is assert that it has the power to increase a State's reduction obligations beyond what a focus on the effects of its emissions would require, simply because EPA has decided that it would be reasonably affordable for that State to bear a higher burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="3804.563" offset="15323807">And what that means is that States here which are making only a very slight contribution to air quality problems in downwind States are nonetheless required to make very substantial reductions, in many cases far more than States that are making far greater contributions to poor air quality in the same downwind locations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3822.858" offset="15396950">There is no relationship at all under the EPA's methodology between the amount a State contributes and the amount it has to reduce, because the entire driver is cost.</text>

            <text syncTime="3841.186" offset="15470302">That is, I focused on your argument here in the briefs, which is very clear and very good.</text>
            <text syncTime="3847.474" offset="15495484">And -- and the example that comes to my mind is we have an overgrazing problem in State A.</text>

            <text syncTime="3855.163" offset="15526204">It's caused because cows come in from State B and sheep come in from State C.</text>
            <text syncTime="3860.733" offset="15548460">The cow men and the sheep men are in different States.</text>

            <text syncTime="3865.635" offset="15568104">[Laughter]</text>
            <text syncTime="3867.653" offset="15576150">Now, it turns out -- it turns out that EPA, which is in charge of preventing the overgrazing, discovers that if the sheep men build a fence, that will cure the problem, even though they only contribute half or maybe less.</text>
            <text syncTime="3884.782" offset="15644696">Well, if we bury it -- you know, we divide it equally, you each have to pay -- you each have to cause half the problem because that seems fair, it's going to end up that the people in State A with the cows, they're going to starve to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="3899.525" offset="15703628">So our choice is between taking two people, two States, each of whom cause half the problem and getting an overall plan where you solve the problem at minimal cost or just dividing it 50/50, which seems fair in mathematics, but leads to starvation, cost and death, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="3922.557" offset="15795788">Do you see what I'm driving at?</text>
            <text syncTime="3923.874" offset="15801012">And that's what they've done here, the second method.</text>
            <text syncTime="3926.426" offset="15811252">They -- rather the -- they're not treating each State alike, you are right.</text>

            <text syncTime="3950.791" offset="15908741">Certainly, it is the case and we would acknowledge that there are always going to be legitimate policy arguments in favor of the least cost, most efficient solution to any problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3960.599" offset="15947925">But we would also say that there are countervailing policy arguments at issue here, and we do believe the statute sides with those countervailing policy arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3969.805" offset="15984810">And the countervailing policy arguments here are focused on the fact that in Your Honor's hypothetical, where there's one State that it would cost more to reduce and another State it would cost less.</text>
            <text syncTime="3981.429" offset="16031308">The only scenario in which you get a different result under the EPA's approach and our approach is where the State that would cost more to reduce is, in fact, contributing a lot more to the downwind State's air problem than the other State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3994.820" offset="16084807">And for several reasons we think when the statute looks at that issue and asks the question of whether EPA should have the authority to force the State which is, in fact, contributing less to nonetheless reduce more simply because it's costly, we think there are at least three reasons why the statute embodies the policy choice that says no, the State that contributes more, reduces more; the State that contributes less, reduce less.</text>

            <text syncTime="4276.003" offset="17209535">But, you know, let's say that the standard is a hundred.</text>

            <text syncTime="4343.081" offset="17477864">Well, first of all, I think in the example that Your Honor gave, where you had the two States and should they be each reduced to ten, the reason in favor of doing it that way from a statutory perspective is that that then gives a consistent application to the same causal language in the statute, which means that the same causal effect from one upwind State on a downwind State isn't significant if it comes from Indiana to Delaware, but insignificant if it comes from Tennessee; and that when the statute says that States must prohibit the amounts they significantly contribute, then the more they contribute the more they reduce.</text>
            <text syncTime="4378.337" offset="17618926">So we see that as fitting much more securely within the statutory language than the kind of shifting that Your Honor mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="4384.908" offset="17645153">Certainly one could imagine, since the policy rationales that are behind Your Honor's question are certainly legitimate and more than plausible, certainly one could imagine a statute that Congress could have written which would have said: Treat it at as national playing field; ignore the fact that there are State boundaries; think about what the most efficient way to force reductions to achieve attainment in downwind locations; locate those reductions in the least cost areas, and impose those on the States.</text>

            <text syncTime="4486.375" offset="18051096">And there are other mechanisms in the SIP process when that definition of what amount significantly contributes is then translated into an emission reduction obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4495.064" offset="18085786">We do think there are occasions, and we've noted them in Note 17 of our brief, where the State in then formulating its SIP can say, okay, this is the amount we have to reduce, but we're going to do it in this way because costs have to be taken into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="4507.456" offset="18135419">But that is a very different matter from saying that EPA, in defining what amounts significantly contribute, can do the same thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="4642.410" offset="18675213">But that doesn't bear on how the amount of significant contribution is defined, because when EPA takes costs into account it's not simply preventing the death and destruction and starvation.</text>

            <text syncTime="5093.937" offset="20481319">And EPA's response to that, on Pet App 354(a) was they weren't going to look at lower levels of regulation, because at lower levels of regulation, some sources in some States might cease operating existing controls.</text>

            <label>Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="5159.379" offset="20743066">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5161.331" offset="20750903">As Mr. Keisler indicated, in our reply brief we cited the history of the Restatement as it bears on the common law of nuisance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5168.751" offset="20780578">And as this Court indicated in American Electric Power, if the Clean Air Act had not been enacted, the remedy that downwind States would have in a situation like this one would be a Federal common law nuisance suit against upwind States or polluters in upwind States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5184.863" offset="20845048">And I think there are three lessons to draw from that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="5187.397" offset="20855184">The first is that, as the briefs and argument in this case indicate, judicial resolution of such a suit would have been a Herculean task.</text>
            <text syncTime="5195.552" offset="20887784">And the prospect of doing that through judicial processes should reinforce the wisdom of Congress's choice to replace that mechanism with the Clean Air Act, and it counsels in favor of deference to the expert agency that has been placed in the position that a common law court would previously have been placed in.</text>
            <text syncTime="5215.632" offset="20968033">The second is that, as the reply brief citation to the law of nuisance indicates, the common law court in that scenario would have been able to consider the costs necessary to achieve reduction in pollution upwind in deciding whether a particular remedy would be appropriate or how much of a reduction an upwind polluter should have to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="5234.879" offset="21045042">And there's no reason, absent extraordinarily clear statutory language, to deny EPA the same authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="5241.383" offset="21071060">The third thing is, as the analogy to the common law suit indicates, there are sovereign State interests on both sides of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5249.120" offset="21101989">This is not a matter of EPA versus the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5251.472" offset="21111393">It's a matter of EPA trying to act as an honest broker between the upwind and downwind States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5257.309" offset="21134798">The next thing I would say about the Clean Air Act is that the statute as a whole is replete with references to economic activity and harnessing the profit motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="5268.101" offset="21177953">That is, both the States and EPA are specifically authorized to provide for the trading of allowances, the whole purpose of which is to achieve emission reductions in the most cost-effective manner possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="5282.008" offset="21233541">And I think it's worth noting in this regard that, although we talk about the transport rule as regulating the emission of -- emissions of States, what we're really regulating is emissions of power plants within the States, and the good neighbor provision itself talks about preventing significant contribution from emissions sources or emissions activity within the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5302.857" offset="21316924">And one of the things that the EPA said in the proposed rulemaking was that in some circumstances the cumulative downwind impact of a particular upwind State might be great, not because any particular power plant was poorly regulated or emitting at a high level, but because there were so many power plants in the same State.</text>
            <text syncTime="5323.251" offset="21398531">And one consequence of forbidding the EPA to consider costs is that a particular power plant in an upwind State might be required to install more expensive pollution control measures and make greater reductions simply because it happened to be located in a State with a lot of other power plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="5341.899" offset="21473136">And the last thing I would say is this is -- the statute, as I've said before, has prospective focus.</text>
            <text syncTime="5347.053" offset="21493721">It's intended to be implemented by State officials, and if you ask how would a State official assure herself or feel confident that her own State implementation plan was satisfying good neighbor obligations when she wasn't really sure what other States might be doing, and one way is if a State official said, if everybody else did what I'm doing I can feel confident that the problem would be solved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5370.834" offset="21588911">And that's really the approach that EPA used.</text>
            <text syncTime="5373.534" offset="21599673">It examined certain cost thresholds and it said: At particular cost thresholds we feel confident that if everyone, upwind and downwind States alike -- alike makes pollution control efforts at these levels, the problem will be solved or at least almost solved, because there would still be slight residual nonattainment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5393.682" offset="21680235">And it seems perfectly rational to say that the significant contribution is the amount over and above what would occur if everyone adhered to an approach which, if applied across the board, would solve the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="5407.441" offset="21735301">Thank you.</text>
