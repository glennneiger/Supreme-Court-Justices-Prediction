            <text syncTime="7.935" offset="138742">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="11.123" offset="151490">This Court has repeatedly held that a State prisoner cannot obtain habeas relief under AEDPA unless State court contravenes or unreasonably applies clearly established Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.022" offset="199138">In this case, there was no clearly established Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.083" offset="215333">Under any interpretation of Carter, Estelle, and Mitchell, this Court has never extended Carter to the selection phase of a capital sentencing trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.283" offset="256189">Because there is no clearly established Federal law, the Kentucky Supreme Court was well within its authority to resolve this unresolved question in favor of affirming the sentence.</text>

            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="49.387" offset="304568">Ms. Lenz, could I ask you about what you just said?</text>
            <text syncTime="50.262" offset="308120">You said Carter, Estelle, and Mitchell; those are the three.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.152" offset="319614">So Carter says the Fifth Amendment requires that a criminal trial judge must give a no-adverse-inference jury instruction when requested by a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.085" offset="359320">And that was, of course, not a sentencing case.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.038" offset="367157">Then Estelle says, we discern no basis to distinguish between the guilt and penalty phases of Respondent's capital murder trial so far as the protection of the Fifth Amendment; so a kind of general view that the Fifth Amendment applies equally in the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.906" offset="430687">And then Mitchell holds -- it basically repeats that from Estelle and says, we must accord the privilege the same protection in the sentencing phase of any criminal case, as that which is due in the trial phase.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.902" offset="494635">So when you put those together, Carter with Estelle, Mitchell, how -- why do you think that there's a gap?</text>

            <text syncTime="105.554" offset="529221">Well, there's -- there is a gap between Mitchell and Carter.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.346" offset="556388">First of all, Mitchell was not a jury instruction case.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.065" offset="571330">In Mitchell, while the defendant did plead guilty, she did not plead guilty to all of the conduct, so there were still factors that were being contested.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.279" offset="616156">In this case, Mr. Woodall pled guilty to all of the crimes and aggravating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.184" offset="631725">Mitchell and Estelle were both concerned with protecting the defendant from the prosecution shifting its burden of proof to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.929" offset="674775">In this case, there was no -- there was no burden shifting because Robert Keith Woodall had already pleaded guilty to the facts which the prosecutor was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt to render Mr. Woodall eligible for the death penalty.</text>

            <text syncTime="2319.457" offset="9384835">So this Court has applied this Fifth Amendment prohibition in a pure sentencing selection occasion, and Estelle deals with -- there's a component of silence to it because the psychologist that testified as to the future dangerousness factor relied on the silence of the individual, his failure specifically to say I'm sorry and express remorse about the actions that he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.833" offset="9506357">And this Court cited that component as part of what the psychologist relied on in making the future dangerousness assessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.034" offset="9539167">So Estelle is not totally -- it obviously has a compulsion component and it's driven by the Miranda violation, but there is a component of Estelle which relies specifically on silence and how the silence was used to penalize the individual in becoming a factor in favor of death in the selection process.</text>

            <text syncTime="3351.432" offset="13512809">I would just like to point out at the beginning of his responsive argument my colleague was talking about the selection factors in Estelle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.163" offset="13551680">And whether they're called selection factors or whatever they're called, the prosecutor had to prove future dangerousness beyond a reasonable doubt in order to render the defendant in that case death eligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.486" offset="13596924">There were three things that the prosecution had to prove and that was one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.703" offset="13617822">So those selection factors or whatever you want to call them operated as aggravating circumstances for the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.793" offset="13654184">So I just wanted to make sure that the Court is clear on that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3405.019" offset="13727118">When one speaks of selection factors, one usually doesn't think of death-eligibility factors.</text>
