            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105214">We will hear argument first this morning in Case 12-1168, McCullen v. Coakley.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.404" offset="130814">Mr. Rienzi.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark L Rienzi</label>
            <text syncTime="7.320" offset="134471">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.141" offset="157772">This Court has held that the public sidewalks are a natural and proper place for free citizens to exchange information and ideas, and for that reason the Court has held that public sidewalks occupy a special position in First Amendment analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.583" offset="219526">If the Massachusetts law at issue here makes it a crime to enter onto certain public sidewalks, even for the purpose of peaceful conversation, or leafletting, the law applies at abortion clinics throughout the State on every hour of every day that they are open, regardless of the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.897" offset="296744">Massachusetts asked this Court to uphold that statute under the time, place, and manner test, but the law fails each aspect of that test.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.134" offset="329658">I would like to begin with narrow tailoring.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.919" offset="340838">The State says the law is necessary to protect its interests in preventing obstruction and congestion.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.275" offset="370305">But the law is not narrowly tailored to those interests for three reasons: First, the law applies regardless of whether there's any threat of obstruction or congestion at all, even when the sidewalks are entirely open and empty.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.201" offset="429968">For example, Mrs. McCullen generally does her counseling early in the morning on Tuesdays and Wednesdays beginning at 7:00 o'clock in the morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.474" offset="463092">She testified that she is sometimes alone when she does this counseling.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.759" offset="480228">Nancy Clark testified that 90 percent of the time that she is at the clinic in Worcester, she is all alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.913" offset="508858">A statute that makes it illegal for Mrs. McCullen or Mrs. Clark to engage in peaceful, consensual conversation on a public sidewalk for fear of obstruction and congestion is not narrowly tailored.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="114.589" offset="563506">Mr. Rienzi, the problem that the State faced is it doesn't know -- and it has a history, there was a considerable history of disturbances and blocking the entrance, and it doesn't know in advance who are the well-behaved people and who are the people who won't behave well.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.138" offset="657756">So -- and after the disturbance occurs, it's too late.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.692" offset="679908">So the State is trying to say, We want to make sure that the entrance is not blocked, and the only way we can do that is to have a rule that applies to everyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.666" offset="727869">We can't -- we can't screen people to know who will be well behaved and who will be disruptive.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="mark_l_rienzi" startTime="162.236" stopTime="218.757">
            <label>Mr. Mark L Rienzi</label>
            <text syncTime="162.236" offset="754096">So I think the State is simply wrong about that fact for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.890" offset="772695">There are many tools that the State either has in its current toolbox or could enact that would deal with that concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.878" offset="796623">And if I may back up for a second, I think there are really two different interests that the State asserts when it makes that argument, Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.115" offset="821596">First, they say that there are actual deliberate bad actors.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.750" offset="836120">All right.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.350" offset="838523">There are some people whom the State claims have deliberately violated the law and blocked the door and interfered with access.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.590" offset="863496">And then secondly, the State says there is also some circumstances where there are enough people on the sidewalk that even lawful, consensual conversation might accidentally block the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.628" offset="907696">I think those are actually two quite different interests, but there are tools in the toolbox to deal with both of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.515" offset="931206">For example, Section E of this statute makes it illegal to impede, block, obstruct or even hinder somebody's access to the clinics.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.888" offset="968718">And that section of the statute is not challenged here and never has been.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="218.757" stopTime="235.718">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="218.757" offset="980212">You know, I should probably ask this of the other side, and I will, but do you happen to know when was the last time that Massachusetts prosecuted somebody for obstructing entrance to an abortion clinic?</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark L Rienzi</label>
            <text syncTime="235.718" offset="1048025">So I believe the last cite in the record that I'm aware of is, as of 1997, there was a decision in a previous injunction case against people who had been adjudicated to have broken rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.109" offset="1097554">There is a 1997 case on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.394" offset="1106749">To my knowledge, they've never brought a case, for example, under the Federal FACE law, which has been in existence for 20 years.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="255.698" offset="1127960">So there have been laws against obstruction during this entire period, right?</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark L Rienzi</label>
            <text syncTime="295.807" offset="1288352">I know that in the record there was testimony claiming that that happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.625" offset="1299637">My argument is simply that the State has tools that are deliberately designed to deal with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.113" offset="1317609">And so the United States--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="304.613" stopTime="322.426">
            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="304.613" offset="1323565">Mr. Rienzi, the State says, of that particular tool, that it's a hard thing to prosecute because you have to show intent, and there is a lot of obstruction and interference that goes on naturally just because there are a lot of people around.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.522" offset="1379258">So that is an insufficient tool is what the State argues.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="mark_l_rienzi" startTime="322.426" stopTime="346.291">
            <label>Mr. Mark L Rienzi</label>
            <text syncTime="322.426" offset="1394827">--Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.509" offset="1395245">And so to the extent, what the State is saying -- to the extent the State is claiming that there are deliberate bad actors deliberately blocking the door, I don't think that's a very persuasive argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.996" offset="1425129">There are police on the scene, and if the police say, Get out of the doorway, either the person moves in which case there is not a problem anymore, or they don't, in which case, intent is pretty clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.036" offset="1461283">Amicus United States has prosecuted, I think more than 45 cases and gotten more than 70 convictions under that statute.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="346.291" stopTime="364.353">
            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="346.291" offset="1490331">And sometimes there are those bad actors, but probably more often it's just a function of there are just lots of people, and they, your clients and all of -- all of them want to be as close as possible to the site, and that that naturally leads to an interference with normal access.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="mark_l_rienzi" startTime="364.353" stopTime="391.486">
            <label>Mr. Mark L Rienzi</label>
            <text syncTime="364.353" offset="1562533">And so I agree that's the second part of the State's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.603" offset="1571624">I don't think this law is narrowly tailored to that concern, in two respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.407" offset="1590745">One, the law applies -- you know, the evidence in the case is that the crowds that the State is concerned about happened essentially at one clinic, one day, one time -- Saturday mornings in Boston -- and when they happen, there are video cameras rolling and police officers present.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.916" offset="1644871">And there is no reason to believe the police can't simply say, Move out of the doorway.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.118" offset="1661590">And if someone is in front of the doorway, they certainly should do that.</text>

            <text syncTime="405.580" offset="1727523">Would you want to concede this point that imagine the State has two groups of people and one group feels what the other is doing is terribly wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.352" offset="1766602">And the second group feels, We absolutely want to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.054" offset="1781335">And everyone is in a fragile state of mind, and they want to, if possible, at least one group wants to sort of shout as loud as you could at the other, Please don't do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.195" offset="1821981">And the other says, Please leave me alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.147" offset="1833789">And we are not saying which group is which; the analogy is obvious, but I keep all the titles out.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.384" offset="1858657">Does the State have the right, in your opinion, to say, It's tough to referee this, we see the potential for real harm on one side or the other, so we're going to have this kind of 35-foot boundary?</text>
            <text syncTime="451.109" offset="1909648">You want to concede that and say, okay, but the evidence here didn't doesn't justify it, or do you want to fight that, too?</text>

            <text syncTime="710.211" offset="2945978">And a State passes a regulation that says there's a ton of interference, it's preventing the operation of these facilities, employees can't get in, suppliers can't get in, slaughterhouses are leaving the State because of this problem, and so we're just going to set up a zone and let's call it 30 feet, because it's very hard to enforce anything else.</text>
