            <text syncTime="313.934" offset="1362769">Sitting as an appellate court where its decision was going to be subject to appellate review immediately, perhaps its analysis was different.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.209" offset="1403938">But I think more fundamentally, the absence of a judgment entered by a court with authority to do so means that the appellate court also lacks appellate jurisdiction, and this Court has so recognized in Ayrshire Collieries, in the Glidden case--</text>

            <text syncTime="957.935" offset="3938756">First is that by changing the definition of “ core proceedings ”, there are other collateral consequences for other provisions of the code.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.660" offset="3985672">Under Section 1 -- 1334(c), for example, there is an abstention in certain noncore proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.080" offset="4019422">And so Congress has defined the scope of the abstention according to the same language that it uses in 157(b) whether a proceeding arises under Title 11 or does not do so, but is merely in relation to a case under Title 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.877" offset="4090579">So if the Court goes and revises what Congress has provided as the definition of core in 157(b), there will be collateral consequences for other statutes that Congress had enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.951" offset="4138854">But the second point is that there are, as I think Justice Scalia was suggesting, policy decisions that really only Congress can make in deciding how to respond to Stern, because one can compare, for example, the provisions of 157(c)(1), which is the bankruptcy judge issuing a proposed findings and conclusions, and the Magistrates Act, 636.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.618" offset="4253584">The two are actually quite different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.387" offset="4260584">The magistrates, for example, are assigned a specific motion to consider and issue a report and recommendation on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.810" offset="4294335">By contrast, the bankruptcy court in (c)(1) exercises jurisdiction over the entire proceeding, including up to conducting a trial in something that isn't subject to jury trial, and then issuing a report and recommendation to the district court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1400.920" offset="5710694">And as Schor lays out the many factors that the Court might consider, the fact that consent is a limiting feature on the non-Article 3 body's jurisdiction might lead the Court to conclude there was no Article 3 violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.679" offset="5769731">But here, where there was no consent in this statute, the Court has already held in Stern that there was an Article 3 violation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1577.700" offset="6417881">So if I could take you back to the statute, and I'll use the Solicitor General's brief for convenience.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.917" offset="6434704">157(b)(1) is the provision by which district courts, if they want to -- there's no compulsion on these Article 3 officers -- if they want to, they can refer matters to bankruptcy judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.394" offset="6484650">And it says, when there is a matter referred, that they may hear and determine the matter and may enter an order or judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1612.939" offset="6558837">They can simply hear and determine the matter and not enter an order and judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.175" offset="6575765">And I can contrast this textual language -- you don't have to go very far -- down in (c)(1) and (c)(2), where (c)(2), there was only one “ may ”, they don't have the double “ may permissive grant of authority ”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.715" offset="6617874">And there's -- and in the noncore matters, there's a -- a “ it shall ”, when “ it shall determine ”.</text>

            <text syncTime="2658.648" offset="10741668">There's been hundreds of years of consensual adjudication with these inferior judicial officers, as that they were called in the earlier cases, such as Go-Bart.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.919" offset="10774687">They are officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.187" offset="10779807">They're inferior judicial officers, and they are controlled by the Article 3 judiciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.573" offset="10797362">The Article 3 judiciary retains the control to use them or not use them as they want, and parties can't be forced to do them over their -- without their consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.662" offset="10829753">So when this Court has had opportunity to address Article 3 concerns of this, they have always relied upon the lack of consent as a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.335" offset="10860369">And that's why this Court's formulation in Stern, I think, is critical, just following Union Carbide, and indeed every opinion in Northern Pipeline, going back to the MacDonald case under the old act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.706" offset="10897881">What matters missing is the lack of consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.556" offset="10905299">Plenary matters can't be tried without consent under the old Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.941" offset="10918779">When there is consent, this Court ruled under MacDonald, that's fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.060" offset="10931317">Indeed, when there's implied consent, this court held in Klein against Baker in the American College's amicus brief, that's fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.732" offset="10957962">And as the American College also lays out well, these old statutory cases under the old Bankruptcy Act were interpreted with constitutional values in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.005" offset="10995056">The old act was very cryptically drafted and tersely drafted, so this court used constitutional principles in interpreting the scope of the old Bankruptcy Act and upholding the consensual adjudication of plenary matters when there is consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.663" offset="11049704">So our submission, Mr. Chief Justice, is yes, we do think that consent matters.</text>

            <text syncTime="2773.536" offset="11201215">We believe that a party may consent to have a fraudulent conveyance claim determined by a bankruptcy judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.940" offset="11222844">And even in the absence of consent, principles of severability justify treating such an action as a noncore proceeding in which a bankruptcy judge may enter proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.731" offset="11265998">There's also one other aspect of our argument that has not yet been mentioned this morning, which is that we think that even if consent is not adequate to cure the constitutional violation or if you find that there is not adequate consent on this record, we think that it would still be open to you to find that petitioner has forfeited this constitutional argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.709" offset="11341858">Constitutional arguments can be forfeited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.742" offset="11350008">He has not -- he did not advance this argument at any point -- any reasonable point before the bankruptcy judge, before the district judge, until he was before the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.431" offset="11384803">Indeed, I think it's telling that this Court had already granted certiorari in Stern and had already heard oral argument in Stern before the district court even ruled on the motion for summary judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2960.704" offset="11949884">And I think this is actually essentially what the Court has already said in Stern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.239" offset="11963990">In Stern, on page 2620, this Court characterized the effect of its decision as being,</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.243" offset="11988023">"The removal of Vicky's counterclaim there from core bankruptcy jurisdiction. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.447" offset="12008816">And the consequence of that is that, because the Congress had divided the world into core and noncore proceedings in the wake of Northern Pipeline, thinking that the distinction between them was core proceedings were ones in which bankruptcy judges would have authority, constitutional authority to enter final judgments; noncore proceedings were ones in which they could not do that without consent, or they would only be able to provide proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.996" offset="12103066">And in the same paragraph where this Court that the effect of its decision was effectively to remove this, that type of counterclaim from core jurisdiction, it said it did not expect that this decision would meaningfully change the division of labor between the bankruptcy and district court judges, precisely because Pearce Marshall was not contesting the idea that bankruptcy judges would still be able to enter proposed findings of facts and conclusions of law.</text>
