            <label>Mr. Timothy J. Simeone</label>
            <text syncTime="7.620" offset="137292">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="10.956" offset="150666">The IUB's arguments here would transform Younger abstention from the exception into the rule for State agency adjudications.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.246" offset="191835">Virtually all State agency decisions, even on issues of Federal law would be subject to challenge only in State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.083" offset="223182">There's no basis for that broad rule in this Court's decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.221" offset="239692">Younger abstention began with the traditional principle going back to the time of the framing that Federal courts sitting in equity shouldn't intrude on State criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.993" offset="282846">This Court's decisions have, of course, expanded Younger slightly beyond criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.831" offset="306147">In Huffman, in Moore, in Trainor, the Court extended Younger to civil enforcement actions in aid of State criminal laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.705" offset="345644">In Middlesex County in Dayton, the Court extended Younger to administrative disciplinary actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.442" offset="372603">But all of these cases are still coercive civil enforcement actions, where the State's enforcement interests are similar to those in criminal cases.</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="76.548" offset="413040">Counsel, one of the problems I have is I don't know how to define ‵‵ coercive ′′.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.237" offset="439789">The line seems very hard to draw.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.789" offset="457971">There are plenty of examples in the brief where some courts have said this kind of proceeding is coercive and that kind is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.359" offset="484302">So--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="timothy_j_simeone" startTime="95.426" stopTime="97.561">
            <label>Mr. Timothy J. Simeone</label>
            <text syncTime="95.426" offset="488586">Yes, Your Honor.</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="97.561" offset="497050">--is it -- is it worthwhile using that distinction at all, or should we be thinking about going back to basic principles and doing something like the Second Circuit does, which is to say it's a sovereign interest rather than a personal interest?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="timothy_j_simeone" startTime="113.737" stopTime="156.449">
            <label>Mr. Timothy J. Simeone</label>
            <text syncTime="113.737" offset="561729">Your Honor, we've argued that there is no magic to the -- to the word ‵‵ coercive ′′.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.724" offset="585762">Coercive is a sort of shorthand that the lower courts have used to mean coercive in the ways that this Court's Younger decisions are coercive.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.449" offset="628603">So, I think the question of how far this Court has extended Younger is really the heart of this case as opposed to sort of what is the meaning of the word ‵‵ coercive ′′.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.424" offset="672488">And I think, as I was saying, the Court started with criminal cases, and it extended that principle somewhat in Huffman and Moore and Trainor.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="156.449" stopTime="162.253">
            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="156.449" offset="732674">Those were when most of them involved State proceedings.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="timothy_j_simeone" startTime="162.253" stopTime="185.017">
            <label>Mr. Timothy J. Simeone</label>
            <text syncTime="162.253" offset="755871">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.437" offset="760573">There's -- they're -- but they're a specific kind of State enforcement action.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.157" offset="779486">In each of those cases, this Court held that the State enforcement action was in aid of criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.161" offset="807489">So it's a small extension of the traditional principle that courts sitting in equity don't intrude on State criminal cases.</text>

          <turn speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="185.017" stopTime="191.005">
            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="185.017" offset="846882">But then we went further in Pennzoil and in New Orleans -- well, perhaps not.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="timothy_j_simeone" startTime="191.004" stopTime="296.340">
            <label>Mr. Timothy J. Simeone</label>
            <text syncTime="191.004" offset="870810">Yes, the Court went further in a couple of different directions, and I want to try to address them separately, if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.926" offset="898500">The first direction is really the Dayton Middlesex County cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.330" offset="920129">Those were administrative disciplinary actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.466" offset="936743">And I think the Dayton case is actually especially helpful here in drawing the kind of line that you're looking for, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.353" offset="964224">The Dayton case helps to give some substance to exactly what is a civil enforcement proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.709" offset="993690">So in -- in Dayton, the Ohio Civil Rights Commission conducted an investigation and found that the school there had engaged in discrimination on the basis of sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.433" offset="1040606">The commission proposed a consent order, and it told the school if you don't agree to this consent order under which you need to hire back the professor -- I mean, the teacher and pay her backpay, then we're going to proceed to disciplinary action; we're going to file an administrative complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.411" offset="1112495">The school ignored the consent order, refused to show up for a hearing that the commission had scheduled.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.965" offset="1138722">And so in Dayton, the State filed an administrative complaint, charging violations of the Ohio Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.421" offset="1172472">And those violations that were charged were third-degree misdemeanors subject to fines, subject to jail time, up to 60 days in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.426" offset="1208521">So we think that Dayton gives some substance to what is a civil enforcement action.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.830" offset="1234121">It's the sort of proceeding where you have an investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.949" offset="1242585">You have factual findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.734" offset="1249794">You have an administrative complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.351" offset="1260243">You have the possibility of civil penalties and potentially, in that case, there was jail time as well.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="296.340" offset="1292217">Mr. Simeone, this -- the background of this case, I don't quite grasp.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.094" offset="1319176">You originally said that you wanted to make sure you -- there was no disconnection pending the FCC's resolution of the issue.</text>

          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="320.172" stopTime="326.126">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="320.172" offset="1387512">Has the FCC had a proceeding to resolve it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Timothy J. Simeone</label>
            <text syncTime="326.126" offset="1411336">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.728" offset="1417709">Although the FCC is surprisingly adept at not resolving the issue in the proceedings that it holds to resolve the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.049" offset="1447071">So, in fact, the FCC had a proceeding pending before it at the time that this case was before the IUB, in which Sprint expected that the -- that the FCC would resolve this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.659" offset="1501510">What the FCC did was resolve the issue of what inter-carrier compensation regime applies going forward, but it didn't address these calls that have already occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.616" offset="1549262">So this is a sort of strange corner of telecommunications law now.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.770" offset="1573922">Going forward, the FCC has applied specific inter-carrier compensation regime under Federal law to this kind of call.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.976" offset="1614777">But going backwards, the appropriate inter-carrier compensation regime to apply under the 1996 act under the federal law is -- is still at issue.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="385.934" offset="1650617">Well, why wouldn't -- let's say you -- you -- there were no abstention.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.087" offset="1679143">You have your case in Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.805" offset="1690010">And the Federal judge says, the FCC hasn't spoken, so I don't want to step out in front of the FCC on this on this -- on this question.</text>

            <label>Mr. Timothy J. Simeone</label>
            <text syncTime="411.549" offset="1753017">We -- we strongly urged the IUB not to address these issues of Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.642" offset="1805367">The IUB, I think, was frustrated with the FCC, which had not implemented the relevant provisions of Federal law, and the IUB reached out to make decisions on Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.930" offset="1850506">And all we're saying in this case is that we -- we think that we ought to be able to challenge those decisions that the IUB made as to what's an information service, what's a telecommunications service.</text>

            <text syncTime="447.924" offset="1898572">You could challenge it in the State court or this Court and -- eventually.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.959" offset="1918634">But there's a proceeding going on in the State court, and there's a review -- State review attached to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.898" offset="1954474">And you're -- you're saying we can cut off this administrative process that ends in State review.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.254" offset="1987806">We could cut it off and go to the Federal court.</text>

            <text syncTime="472.973" offset="1998777">To be clear, Your Honor, we actually aren't seeking to enjoin any proceeding in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.811" offset="2030124">We filed the action in State court because we were required to by Eighth Circuit law.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.465" offset="2052694">The Eighth Circuit has a line of cases.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="488.999" offset="2062829">You explained that.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.834" offset="2074219">But -- but in the review -- in your review petition from the State court -- to the State court, you brought up more than just this -- the question of these -- these charges.</text>

            <label>Mr. Timothy J. Simeone</label>
            <text syncTime="507.646" offset="2137435">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.513" offset="2140883">This could -- this is a situation quite comparable to the England case.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.367" offset="2160318">In the England case, the -- the Federal court plaintiffs thought that they were required to go to State court with their Federal law issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.405" offset="2200443">And this Court said that they didn't have to go to Federal court -- to State court with their Federal law issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.226" offset="2227714">And since they did, they were still entitled to reserve their Federal law issues for Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.498" offset="2256867">In our case, we actually were required by Eighth Circuit precedent to go to State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.136" offset="2283407">The Eighth Circuit rule is that if you don't go to State court with your Federal law issues then abstention, Younger abstention applies anyway, even though there is no State proceeding whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.026" offset="2330950">So in this case we went to State court, but only because we had to under Eighth Circuit -- under the Eighth Circuit's unusual law of Younger abstention.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.899" offset="2370447">When we got to State court, we tried to essentially do an England reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.369" offset="2392286">We said to the State court: We'd like to stay the Federal issues while they go forward in Federal court, because, of course, the Federal court has jurisdiction and a virtually unflagging obligation to exercise that jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.527" offset="2440978">The State court actually held those issues in abeyance for 2 years while the abstention issues were heard in Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.402" offset="2480475">When the Federal abstention issues were decided by the Eighth Circuit, incorrectly we think, the State court decided to go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.924" offset="2518509">But our argument here is that in a system of concurrent jurisdiction where we have the right to be in Federal court, to get review of our Federal law issues, the fact that we were forced by Eighth Circuit law to go to State court too shouldn't preclude the Federal court proceeding from going forward.</text>

            <text syncTime="662.463" offset="2756642">What we think is that if this were still before the IUB, that would really take us back to our main argument here in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.002" offset="2790810">Our argument is that neither the State court proceeding nor the IUB proceeding was the kind of civil enforcement action to which this Court has extended Younger.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.928" offset="2846503">So even if we'd filed in Federal court at the time that proceeding was still pending before the IUB, we think that Younger still shouldn't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.934" offset="2886523">But here there's an additional reason why it shouldn't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.319" offset="2900106">We waited for the IUB proceeding to conclude.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.504" offset="2912854">And, by the way, we then paid the invoices that Windstream wanted us to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.325" offset="2932185">There's -- there's nothing further that we could be obliged to do here.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.877" offset="2946291">We've already paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.146" offset="2951411">But the -- but the additional reason why we think we would -- we should prevail here really goes to the issue that this Court reserved in NOPSI.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.167" offset="2995505">So in NOPSI, the Court assumed, without deciding, that the agency proceeding and the State court review of the agency proceeding were a unitary proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.261" offset="3043884">We think that those proceedings should only be treated as unitary in situations where the State interests at the two levels are similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.200" offset="3087665">So in Burford, to go back to your question, Your Honor, in Burford the State appellate court was participating in the regulatory process with the State agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.175" offset="3131551">And of course this Court treated that as a unitary proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.060" offset="3147120">In this case, the State court proceeding, as the IUB discusses on pages 33 and 34 of its brief, has nothing to do with the partnership with the -- with the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.838" offset="3210232">The relevant partnership here, the relevant place to review the Federal law issues, is Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.342" offset="3240221">The State's only interest in the State court proceeding here is a State interest in State court review, as opposed to Federal court review, of Federal law issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.883" offset="3290376">That's not the same kind of interest that it had at the regulatory proceeding level.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.553" offset="3313050">So, our view here is that issue in NOPSI of -- you know, is the State interest for purposes of Younger the interest at the agency level or is there a separate interest when it comes to State judicial review of State agency action and Federal judicial review of State agency action, we think that that should be resolved in our favor.</text>

            <text syncTime="858.490" offset="3540838">It's somewhat complicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.523" offset="3548883">We went to the agency with an issue of State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.460" offset="3564661">We went to the agency to ask the agency to hold that Windstream was not entitled to stop connecting our calls to its customers without IUB approval under Iowa's consumer protection rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.820" offset="3626101">So that's the issue that we took to the State agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.422" offset="3640521">When we got to the State agency, Windstream said: Oh, no, no, no, we are not going to really stop connecting your calls to our customers, because that's a big no-no in the telecommunications world.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.163" offset="3683466">You are not supposed to stop connecting calls.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.015" offset="3690885">So that dispute went away.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.717" offset="3705723">What the IUB did was it reached out to decide a different set of issues, the underlying question of what intercarrier compensation regime should apply to these calls.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.941" offset="3758594">So at that point, the IUB's theory now is when they reached out to decide these Federal issues under the 1996 Act -- you know, what's an information service, what's a telecommunication service, what intercarrier compensation regime applies here -- when they reached out to decide those Federal issues they say this case became a civil enforcement performance proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.740" offset="3849814">But this takes me back to my description of Dayton.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.675" offset="3857546">Dayton was a civil enforcement proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.460" offset="3868622">There was an investigation there.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.310" offset="3876041">There was a finding of violations of the Ohio civil rights statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.548" offset="3893073">There was an administrative complaint charging third degree misdemeanors and threatening penalties and jail time.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.035" offset="3922957">That is the kind of civil enforcement proceeding to which this Court has applied Younger.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.589" offset="3945213">That's the kind of proceeding that's like a criminal case, that takes us back to that traditional principle that courts, Federal courts sitting in equity, don't intrude into State criminal proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="988.441" offset="4060570">I think that, again, the posture of the case was very different.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.560" offset="4077079">There, you know, there was -- again, there was an investigation, there was a due process right to a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.547" offset="4097037">There was an agency that was enforcing existing State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.285" offset="4120025">Here, the agency was essentially implementing Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.003" offset="4138833">The FCC hadn't implemented these provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.572" offset="4149073">Everyone in the industry was frustrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.306" offset="4156074">We were frustrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.190" offset="4159626">We had taken these issues to the FCC, you know, please decide what intercarrier compensation regime applies here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.560" offset="4185122">The FCC hadn't done it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.079" offset="4191182">And so the IUB, quite understandably, reached out to decide those issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.798" offset="4209990">But in announcing the kind of intercarrier compensation regime that ought to apply to these calls, the IUB wasn't conducting an enforcement proceeding against Sprint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.506" offset="4252831">An interesting point here, I think, is that the IUB's position makes for something very strange under Ex Parte Young.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.445" offset="4288567">You know, agencies generally have the choice to proceed either by rulemaking, which they often do, or by adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.567" offset="4325138">And they can make the exact same rules in either way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.537" offset="4341021">Under the -- under the IUB's theory, if the agency proceeds by rulemaking under Ex Parte Young, you can go to Federal court and get an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.493" offset="4384802">If the agency proceeds by adjudication, making the exact same rules, you can't, because there is a unitary proceeding up through the State court appeals, and you are stuck with that, and certiori review by this Court, of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.039" offset="4450944">That to me makes no sense under Ex Parte Young.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.474" offset="4464736">The agency's decision to proceed by rulemaking versus proceeding by adjudication -- which, by the way, the IUB had in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.912" offset="4502457">The IUB, when the dispute disappeared between Sprint and Windstream, the IUB could have said: We'll close that docket and we're going to start a rulemaking to implement these provisions of Federal law that the FCC can't seem to get around to implementing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.272" offset="4563897">In that case, we would, of course, have been entitled under ex parte Younger -- and this is an ex parte Younger case -- we could have gone to Federal court and gotten an injunction, a declaratory ruling and injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.199" offset="4619590">And, of course, it really doesn't make sense to distinguish whether that relief is available on the basis of what -- how the agency decides to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.073" offset="4663163">I want to go back to a question that came up earlier about Pennzoil and Juidice and how they fit into this Court's extension of that traditional principle that -- that courts of equity shouldn't intrude into State criminal proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.605" offset="4761278">Juidice and Pennzoil are a kind of unusual corner of Younger abstention law, because they both involve challenges to the processes that the States use to enforce their judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.733" offset="4825749">So, in Juidice, the Federal Plaintiff was asking -- what challenging under -- under the due process clause New York's contempt procedures, sort of how they went about holding folks in contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.760" offset="4885830">In Pennzoil, Texaco was challenging the bond requirements to appeal in Texas, but they were both Federal court cases bringing challenges to aspects of the way -- the way that the States enforce their judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.288" offset="4955943">In this case, Sprint has no quarrel at all with any aspect of Iowa law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.423" offset="4976527">We followed Iowa law to a T and -- and filed the State court appeal that the Eighth Circuit required us to file.</text>

            <text syncTime="1250.061" offset="5107035">The -- the basic idea of Younger is that Federal courts sitting in equity don't intrude into State criminal proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.785" offset="5146010">That's a very important traditional rule because that's where the State police power is really at its zenith, you know, enforcing State criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.558" offset="5189060">We think that the Pennzoil and Juidice cases are very similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.212" offset="5207659">The -- the idea that a State can't enforce a judgment once its courts have gone through the process of coming to judgment is -- would be very unsettled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.353" offset="5252276">That's -- that's the kind of police -- you know, State police power at its absolute zenith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.907" offset="5278503">Now, all the things that State regulatory agencies do are important, you know, but -- but, you know, not every rule of a State agency is at that same level of importance as a State criminal court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1321.176" offset="5391561">And I think that the State's interests in that kind of disciplinary proceeding is, in fact, very similar to its interest in a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.830" offset="5422176">In -- in Middlesex County itself, of course, a lawyer had referred to a trial as a kangaroo court and a legalized lynching.</text>

            <text syncTime="1468.587" offset="5981197">Under Sprint's proposed test, after Sprint chose to invoke the jurisdiction of the Iowa Utilities Board, Windstream could have gone to Federal court at any time to enjoin the board proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.847" offset="6038248">Because under Sprint's test, the board proceedings were remedial and the -- Younger abstention was not applicable to those proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.388" offset="6080358">That's true despite the fact that at that time, when the petition was filed, the board was faced with a compelling State interest; that is, an immediate and direct threat to public health and welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.112" offset="6131244">If Windstream had been able to go to the Federal court and interrupt the State proceedings at that moment, that very act would unavoidably cast dispersions on the State's ability to resolve the Federal issues here in the context of that important State interest, and that is precisely one of the evils that Younger abstention is directed to.</text>

            <text syncTime="1590.884" offset="6470418">Instead of having Sprint in the position of saying that the access -- intrastate access charge tariff does not apply at all, imagine that the dispute between Sprint and Windstream was over merely the calculation of the amounts, over un -- over ambiguous language within that tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.013" offset="6538859">And because Sprint admitted that the tariff applied, whatever it meant, there would be no threat of disconnection.</text>

            <text syncTime="1626.774" offset="6613883">This case involved the Filed Tariff Doctrine, a statutory provision the Court's familiar with, that the board is charged with enforcing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2768.635" offset="11181341">The last thing I wanted to address is there is a lot of discussion, particularly in some of the amicus briefs, to the effect that the board was acting under Federally delegated authority here under some -- as some kind of deputized Federal agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.331" offset="11268172">That is not the case at all here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.383" offset="11280397">The board was acting under its State law authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.569" offset="11289069">Sprint relies, for instance, on the AT&amp;T vs. Iowa Utilities Board case for the proposition that the 1996 Telecommunications Act asserted Federal authority to regulate local telecommunications matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.245" offset="11347793">That's true insofar as it goes, but that case is limited to matters addressed by the '96 Act, which was addressed to create in competition within the local exchange marketplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.570" offset="11397112">What we're talking about in this case is access services by which a long distance carrier such as Sprint delivers a long distance call to the local exchange carrier such as Windstream for completion to Windstream's customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.229" offset="11459701">That service remains practically a monopoly service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.316" offset="11480077">Sprint has no way to get those calls to Windstream's customers other than by connecting it to Windstream and letting Windstream -- compensating Windstream for carrying those calls to the end.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.774" offset="11525948">Because of that, the Federal Telecommunications Act of '96 in Section 251(g) expressly reserved the tariff access charge regime and did not affect the State's jurisdiction over intrastate access charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.319" offset="11592090">Sprint acknowledges that in its reply brief at pages 22 and 23, but claims that the situation is unclear as to what applied between 1996 and 2011.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.977" offset="11642767">But the fact remains that Sprint paid those intrastate access charges without protest from 1996 to 2009, when it made the unilateral decision to change the process and start withholding those payments.</text>

            <text syncTime="2951.787" offset="11914023">I hope to be very brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.656" offset="11929487">But there was a lot of discussion about the problem with the IUB's approach lacking sort of meaningful limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.579" offset="11961148">And I just want to say a couple words about the Middlesex County test, because I don't think that that lack of meaningful limits necessarily follows from -- from the Middlesex County test, although I do think some clarification of the test would be -- would be helpful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.041" offset="12026976">Under Middlesex County, of course, Younger requires an ongoing State judicial proceeding and it requires an important State interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.996" offset="12070862">So with respect to ongoing State judicial proceeding, the IUB understands ‵‵ judicial ′′ to be any adjudicative proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.335" offset="12108165">But as we argue in our briefs, that's not necessarily consistent with the rest of this Court's cases under -- applying Younger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.393" offset="12148394">‵‵ Judicial ′′ we think means an exercise of the State's judicial enforcement authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.964" offset="12174725">So, limiting that prong of Middlesex County to an exercise of the State's judicial enforcement authority would help to draw this line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.836" offset="12214222">A second similar point is with respect to the State interest prong of Middlesex County, we argue, of course, that the relevant State interest is the State's interest in the ongoing State proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.781" offset="12277961">Here the ongoing State proceeding was this -- was judicial review of the agency proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.185" offset="12303561">So, by -- by limiting the proceeding that you're looking at to the ongoing State judicial proceeding required by the first prong of Middlesex County, then you're really just looking at the State's interest in State judicial review of Federal law questions as opposed to Federal court judicial review of -- of Federal law questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.800" offset="12394049">And again, that seems to me to help to draw a line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.252" offset="12407842">Unless there are further questions, that was all I had.</text>
