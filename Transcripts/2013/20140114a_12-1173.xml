            <text syncTime="8.529" offset="140717">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="11.778" offset="153673">If upheld, the decision below will upset 100 years of property law and title to perhaps a million acres of land, based upon an implied reversionary interest that the government recently created.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.115" offset="207068">I would like to make three points: First, the decision below violates Leo Sheep, where this Court rejected the government's attempt to create a property interest through implication and reaffirmed that the government does not retain any interest not expressly reserved in the patent or the granting statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.217" offset="275509">Two, the decision below is contrary to both the government's argument and this Court's ruling in Great Northern that 1875 Act rights-of-way are easements and are not fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.994" offset="322529">And finally, the decision below is inconsistent with the Department of Interior's longstanding interpretation that the 1875 Act granted only an easement.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.412" offset="360250">It is axiomatic that the highest evidence of title in this country is a patent from the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.815" offset="385850">When the government issues a patent, it divests itself of title except for those interests expressly reserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.985" offset="414584">Here, the patent did not reserve any interest in the 1875 Act--</text>

            <text syncTime="97.447" offset="496400">Yet the government knew how to reserve interests at that time because it reserved the interest for ditches and canal, and reserved the right to two Forest Service roads when it issued the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.269" offset="543629">That some interests were reserved by the government in 1976 shows that other interests were not.</text>

            <text syncTime="166.840" offset="773925">That it was subject to those rights for railroad purposes as had been granted to the railroad sounds like it was granted subject to a servitude.</text>

            <text syncTime="181.585" offset="832962">And of course that's how the Department of Interior interpreted it at the time, that these 1875 rights-of-way were easements, following its longstanding interpretation plus this Court's ruling in Great Northern that these were easements.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.282" offset="883744">And at the time, that regulation was the law of the land.</text>

            <text syncTime="1834.855" offset="7446016">But I think that the way that you read the brief is the way that you read opinions, which is in the context in which it was decided, particularly because Footnote 4, and this Court's opinion responding to Footnote 4, made clear that they were only addressing mineral rights where the United States held the surrounding parcel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.802" offset="7509860">And -- and that's particularly true because this Court had already construed Section 4 of the 1875 Act before Great Northern in Stalker and in Steinke.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.734" offset="7549566">And in Stalker, the Court held that the subject to -- this is on page 154 -- a patent was subject to the railroad rights acquired by approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.903" offset="7586242">That's the approval in Section 4, in the subject to language in Section 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.432" offset="7600348">"Upon approval, the grounds so selected were segregated from the public lands and the required material to withdraw the land granted from the market. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.038" offset="7646741">And then the Court goes on, and this is on page 154 again, "The later patent", the patent issued to a settler.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.207" offset="7675476">Even though the local land office forgot to or omitted to mark the right-of-way on the land plats, the subsequent patent was inoperative to pass title to those later patentholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.373" offset="7728139">And then in Steinke -- this is 1922 -- the Court followed Stalker and said,</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.558" offset="7752798">"The approved map under Section 4 is the equivalent of a patent. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.166" offset="7771293">And then they go on to say, citing Stalker, that the later patent was inoperative to pass title.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.334" offset="7799923">And I think it's important, in both of those cases, the Court cited to Interior's regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.817" offset="7821866">In Stalker, the Court quoted at length the regulations from 1888, which, although the Court suggested that in Great Northern those were the first regulations, they actually weren't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.889" offset="7870140">There were prior regulations in 1878 which discuss nothing about the nature of the fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.888" offset="7890202">And those, unfortunately, are hard to find.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.372" offset="7896054">They are in Senate Executive Document 30, 45th Congress, Third Session, 1879.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.573" offset="7920922">So -- but the regs that the Petitioners now rely on were specifically referenced by the Court, including the regs that say the disposition of the land surrounding the right-of-way is subject to the right-of-way.</text>

            <text syncTime="1995.493" offset="8088524">And he -- he, I think, said that when you convey subject to divestment, the -- something called season under the common law went to the recipient of the conveyance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.111" offset="8151009">But if you conveyed an easement, season did not pass.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.907" offset="8166264">So in holding that it is an easement, you're holding there was no season, and therefore, it couldn't be a divestiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.597" offset="8200955">Now, whether that's true or not or I've misremembered it, I'd go back to Justice Scalia's question.</text>

            <text syncTime="2546.899" offset="10294199">If you take language in the abstract and you divorce it from the context of the case, the Court's decisions are conflicting, but when you look at the context of the case, you look at Great Northern with respect to saying that the subsurface interests, the mineral interests are like an easement with respect to the United States vis-a-vis the railroad, but then you have Stalker and Steinke saying that when under Section 4 of the Act -- it's an authoritative construction of Section 4 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.076" offset="10406944">When you approve a map of a railroad under Section 4, it is tantamount to a patent and thereafter a subsequent patent does not confer an interest on a patentee?</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.555" offset="10456785">Those cases are reconciled, we think, by acknowledging that Stalker and Steinke control at least with respect to the surface interests, and then with respect to the subsurface interests, Great Northern clearly says that, at least vis-a-vis the United States and the railroad where there is no third-parties involved that is deemed to be like an easement that would not give a subsurface interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="2881.375" offset="11632086">And what we're saying is that, no, Stalker and Steinke remain good law, even if you characterize the right of way as having attributes of an easement because it's clear it can't be a common law easement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.308" offset="11687884">I don't think that even -- petitioner may be able to dispute this -- but a common law easement, as this Court has explained, would not give as traditionally framed exclusive or perpetual occupation to the railroad.</text>

            <text syncTime="2911.769" offset="11753713">All those are very practical, real rights that would have to be conferred that would be greater than a mere common law easement.</text>

            <text syncTime="2984.606" offset="12045030">That's what this Court's basically said in Union Pacific in 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.354" offset="12068018">In Union Pacific, the Court said look, these pre-1871 cases use the term "limited fee", but really, we're not going to deem that to be controlling with respect to the mineral rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.443" offset="12112322">And the Court is doing exactly what we're saying should be done here, which is you understand the right-of-way in the context of the statutory text, in the context of the environment, the surrounding statutory environment in the context of this Court's decisions, and it's not a binary black-or-white choice between, you know, common law terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.670" offset="12189331">Congress didn't use those common law terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.888" offset="12198108">Congress used the term "right-of-way".</text>
