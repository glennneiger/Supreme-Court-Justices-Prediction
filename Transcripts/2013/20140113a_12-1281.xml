            <text syncTime="456.961" offset="1936873">I would point the Court to Jefferson's Manual of Parliamentary Procedure, which describes a recess by adjournment as occurring within a session.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.567" offset="1971250">I would point to the Adjournment Clause itself, which says if the -- one house of Congress wants to take a break of longer than 3 days during the session, it needs the consent of the other house, which indicates that the Framers contemplated the possibility of a break longer than 3 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.278" offset="2046065">I would point the Court to the parliamentary practice of the House of Commons, where the speaker of the House of Commons had authority to call elections when a member died during the recess.</text>

            <text syncTime="2478.465" offset="10022816">And that reflects the fact that the recess appointment power is a contingent one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.117" offset="10037444">It arises only when the Senate chooses to trigger it by ending its session and beginning its recess.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.753" offset="10060014">So the Senate always has the power to prevent recess appointments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.572" offset="10075270">The Constitution, however, gives the President corresponding powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.443" offset="10090734">If the President thinks that the Senate is being derelict in its duties, he can convene an emergency session, and he can force the Senate to consider his nominees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.865" offset="10124484">And if they refuse, he can subject them to withering criticism for being derelict in their responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.603" offset="10147368">But one -- the one thing that the President may not do is force the Senate to act against its will, nor should the President be permitted to do -- and run around the Senate's refusal to act, because that conception of the Recess Appointments Clause is at war with advice and consent itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="2836.862" offset="11456416">And so an appointment made during the recess lasted until the end of the next session.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.347" offset="11478359">Now, in 1921 Attorney General Doherty's opinion kind of muddled things a bit because he assumed that if you took a long break in the midst of a long session, it broke that break into two recesses for the purposes of the Recess Appointments Clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="2944.381" offset="11886496">But I do take your point that intra-session recess appointments did not become very common, or I should say it this way: Intra-session recess appointments did not become very common until -- really they started with Truman, but then they broke off for a long time with three Presidents, Johnson, Kennedy, and Ford, making no mid-session recess appointments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.745" offset="11975939">Then beginning in the Carter and the Reagan Administrations is when they became very common and particularly a very common way to do an end-run around advice and consent.</text>

            <text syncTime="3131.433" offset="12634747">The third question, by the way, and I just put in your mind, if you digress in your answer, put in your mind what would have happened in 1830 if someone, when they had a 9-month recess, close to 10 months, someone had the bright idea, well, you live near Washington; go show up at wherever we are holding our sessions and sit there for 5 minutes, and we'll stop President Andrew Jackson from making recess appointments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.802" offset="12756164">What would we be saying then?</text>

            <label>Mr. Noel J.  Francisco</label>
            <text syncTime="3163.337" offset="12762329">Sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.704" offset="12763792">Well, I will put my finger on that question and answer your first question first as to the Pay Act in 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.825" offset="12788243">The Pay Act of 1940, in our view, clearly repudiates the government's inter-session view for the reason you put your finger on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.164" offset="12821680">It ties pay to appointments being made either right before or after the session ends.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.818" offset="12844249">So most mid-session recess appointees can't get paid under the Pay Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.270" offset="12858042">With respect to the second question presented, at best it creates three exceptions to the general rule against any pay to any preexisting appointees, so you have got somewhat of a compromise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.844" offset="12904331">I would say that is no more Senate acquiescence in the President's position than the President's acquiescence in the Senate's position when he signed that law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.250" offset="12934006">So to me that's a jump ball.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.300" offset="12942156">Coming back to your historical example, I think it reflects the fact that the Recess Appointments Clause is not about timing, it's not a temporal issue; it's about procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.324" offset="12982280">What it does is it creates a contingent power that arises when the Senate decides to trigger it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.128" offset="13005477">Back at the time of the founding, the senators wanted to trigger that power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.263" offset="13021986">It was important to trigger that power, because when they were gone, the president needed to be able to act unilaterally, unless they wanted to be subject to a recall in emergency sessions every time he needed to confirm nominees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.254" offset="13069947">They obviously didn't want that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.356" offset="13078411">Today, the situation has changed; not the principle, but the historical context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.075" offset="13097324">And today, the Senators can get back to Washington, D.C. very easily.</text>

            <text syncTime="3321.389" offset="13394493">Very few vacancies would arise during a 3-day break, and so there wouldn't be that much of an opportunity to make those kinds of appointments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.043" offset="13421137">Let's put that aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.395" offset="13426571">Let me assume you reject my argument on the second question presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.681" offset="13439737">Then you're really in the world of the 1905 Senate report when they were dealing with President Roosevelt's midnight recess appointments, where he made them in-between gavel drops.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.787" offset="13476099">If you reject their argument on the second question, then I do think that you may need to confront the notion that an inter-session recess is too short to make recess appointments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.743" offset="13515910">Not at issue in this case, because here the appointments came on January 4th, the day after Congress commenced the second session.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.581" offset="13543286">So by anyone's definition, this was an intra-session recess appointment, not an inter-session recess appointment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.668" offset="13571603">And all of this really reflects the fact that the Recess Appointments Clause is a contingent power that arises only when the Senate triggers it, which is what gives the Senate the power to prevent the president from making recess appointments.</text>

            <text syncTime="3408.764" offset="13744011">It's -- in a sense, the Recess Appointments Clause is of a piece with the Inferior Officer's Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.566" offset="13763237">The Senate always has the power of advice and consent, but what the president can do -- what the Senate can do is authorize the president to act unilaterally in certain circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.941" offset="13804720">It can authorize the president to act unilaterally with respect to inferior officers and it can authorize the president to act unilaterally in certain time periods where it ends its session and begins its recess.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.815" offset="13848292">So it's always within the Senate's power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.049" offset="13857173">And that's precisely why advice and consent serves as an important check.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.718" offset="13871802">On the third question presented, I think -- where you're deciding whether or not a session is a real session, then, no, I don't think the Senate could do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.639" offset="13903567">I think that it's for the Court to look at the Senate's journal to see what the facts are, and those facts must be taken by this Court as undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.078" offset="13933242">So if those facts show that there was a Senator who actually gaveled them into session each day, and that during that period they were capable of conducting business, as they were here at every session that they held every three days, then this Court would have to take those facts as a given.</text>

            <text syncTime="3606.535" offset="14535103">Back then, the Senate had the power not to trigger the recess; just like today, it has the power not to trigger the recess appointments power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.889" offset="14568540">The difference is not in principle; it's in historical context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.107" offset="14581392">At the time of the framing, they wanted to trigger the recess appointments power because when they left during long periods of time, they wanted the president to be able to act unilaterally since it was very difficult for them to get back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.083" offset="14633324">And if they didn't trigger the power, the only way the president could act unilaterally would -- the only way the president could confirm nominees would be by convening an emergency session.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.172" offset="14665715">Highly inconvenient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.522" offset="14671044">The historical facts today have changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.141" offset="14681493">Not the principle, but the surrounding facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.676" offset="14691733">And today, it is very easy for the senators to get back to Washington, D.C., and so they don't want to trigger a unilateral power.</text>

            <text syncTime="3659.920" offset="14748680">If the purpose is to permit the president to fill vacancies when the Senate is unavailable to consider nominations and the country would be harmed by having these offices vacant for a period of time, why would that not apply to any lengthy break, whether it's at the end of the session or in the middle of the session?</text>
            <text syncTime="3680.999" offset="14833004">And so if you're arguing that it only applies at the end of the session, doesn't that depend on the assumption that they never thought about the possibility that there would be a lengthy break in the middle of the session?</text>

            <text syncTime="3707.666" offset="14939688">The purpose was also to ensure that the president could not easily do an end run around advice and consent, which after all is the principal method of appointment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3716.089" offset="14973333">And so what they did, as they did with respect to inferior officers, is they vested with the Senate the power in certain circumstances to authorize the president to act unilaterally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3726.562" offset="15015234">With respect to recesses, that authority was triggered when the Senate decided to end its session.</text>
            <text syncTime="3732.366" offset="15038431">The Senate did, for example, take 7 mid session breaks of longer than 10 days prior to 1867.</text>
            <text syncTime="3740.122" offset="15069464">It is inconceivable to me that the senators at that time believed that they were entering into a recess that would have empowered the president to make unilateral appointments during those 10-, 11-, or 12-day periods.</text>
            <text syncTime="3751.262" offset="15114081">And that reflects the fact that the Recess Appointments Clause is a -- is a contingent one that arises when the Senate triggers it.</text>

            <text syncTime="4228.116" offset="17021438">And what the Court said in the Ballin case was that the exercise of rulemaking authority by Congress was almost absolute and beyond the challenge of any body or tribunal unless it usurped some independent constitutional authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="4245.128" offset="17089461">The only possible offer here that the Solicitor General has as to how the Constitution could have been violated by the actions of the Senate in arranging its own affairs is the notion that this has invaded the purported recess appointments power of the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="4264.625" offset="17167515">And the reason, as we say in our brief, why that is completely insubstantial is because, as the Solicitor General recognizes in the closing two pages of its brief, the Senate by the design of the Constitution, the Appointment Clause, the primary method of appointment, has an absolute veto over nominations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4281.401" offset="17234597">The Framers could not have been more clear that the standard power of appointment was a joint power of appointment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4288.157" offset="17261660">And therefore, the Solicitor General is forced to concede that this appointment power, this right that the President is asserting here as a stop on the exercise of the rulemaking authority, is a subsidiary power that only arises if the government -- if the Senate, excuse me, chooses to recess.</text>

            <text syncTime="4609.914" offset="18548661">If the Senate wanted to recess, Rule 22nd of the Senate says that's not a debatable proposition.</text>

            <text syncTime="4783.325" offset="19242264">If the president had the same view about the nature of the pro forma sessions, he could have taken the view about the sessions between December 17th and January 3rd and could have had a better legal argument in attempting to claim that between December 30th and January 3rd, there was at least an arguable inter-session recess.</text>

            <text syncTime="4807.040" offset="19337141">Why didn't he?</text>
            <text syncTime="4808.207" offset="19341843">Because by waiting until the convening of the first session -- of the second session of the 112th Congress, by making an appointment on January 4th instead of the morning of January 3rd, he gives an extra year to his appointees to serve.</text>
            <text syncTime="4825.486" offset="19410911">That shows that this is, indeed, the bottom of the slippery slope on the Recess Appointments Clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="4975.216" offset="20009846">You know, the date was a much different date in the original Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4981.537" offset="20035133">But to answer your earlier question, it is usually the case that a recess is going to be longer than 3 days, but it needn't be.</text>
            <text syncTime="4989.793" offset="20068151">If the Senate finished all of its legislative business, for example, in this year on December 30, 2011, and then voted to adjourn sine die, and did not again meet until the beginning of the second session of the Congress on January 3rd, that would be an intra-session recess even though it would not be one that would require consent of the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="5012.573" offset="20159266">But in the usual case in which a recess is taken for an extended period of time, it would be the type of break that the Framers contemplated would need the consent of the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="5022.780" offset="20200122">And the reason for that should be obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="5025.566" offset="20211198">We have a system of a bicameral legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5029.184" offset="20225722">The houses two are supposed to work together to accomplish the business of the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="5034.353" offset="20246411">If the House is working on something and the Senate wants to go away, or visa-versa, they need the consent of each other because they may need each other to frame out ongoing legislative projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="5048.412" offset="20302626">And if the House in its own judgment thinks that the Senate is sufficiently available to the House in our bicameral system so that it -- so that has been is full compliance with the Adjournments Clause, it is very difficult to see how in the agreement of both houses of Congress that the Senate is in fact effectively available, that is there with its full power of unanimous consent every third day.</text>
            <text syncTime="5076.099" offset="20413386">If the House thinks that that is adequate for the discharge of its constitutional functions and the constitutional functions of the Senate, it's very difficult to see how the president gets to second-guess that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5087.806" offset="20460197">One final point that has to do with the Solicitor General's insistence on the no-business language.</text>

            <text syncTime="5130.316" offset="20630202">Let me begin with a couple of points on intra-session recesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="5135.287" offset="20650160">With respect to the question that Justice Alito raised, it would have been perfectly familiar to the Framers that a legislative body could take an intra-session recess.</text>
            <text syncTime="5147.278" offset="20698120">Jefferson's parliamentary manual written while he was Vice President and presiding over the Senate specifically refers to recesses by adjournment that occur within a session and the session resumes when they are over.</text>
            <text syncTime="5160.269" offset="20750052">The adjournment clause itself contemplates the need for approval by the other branch for a period longer than three days during the session.</text>
            <text syncTime="5171.476" offset="20794878">I think it's difficult to imagine that if, as Justice Alito's hypothetical suggested, that the Senate had in the first years under President Washington decided to take a two-month, intra-session break, that President Washington wouldn't have been able to staff the offices of the fledgling republic using the recess appointment power.</text>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="5193.240" offset="20881918">Well, if we agree with you on the first question, then there either needs to either be a number or a functional test.</text>
            <text syncTime="5198.478" offset="20902920">And I don't know where the number would come from and I don't know how the functional test would play out, so maybe you could say just a word about that.</text>

            <text syncTime="5205.215" offset="20929879">We think the number should be -- should be the number in the Adjournments Clause, 3 days or less.</text>
            <text syncTime="5210.285" offset="20950150">Now, presidents have exercised restraint and there haven't been recess appointments in periods below 10 days, but we think that would be the line.</text>

            <text syncTime="5217.441" offset="20978780">With respect to the presence of that in the Adjournments Clause but the absence of any number in the Recess Appointments Clause, how do you explain that?</text>

            <text syncTime="5224.361" offset="21006470">--Well, I think that there isn't really a need for explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5230.765" offset="21032070">A recess is a suspension of business, and what the Adjournment Clause says is if you are gone for 3 days or less you are not really suspending your business, but if you are gone for more than 3 days you are.</text>
            <text syncTime="5241.723" offset="21075851">And I think that is quite consistent with the argument that my friends on the other side are making.</text>
            <text syncTime="5245.692" offset="21091733">Now, with respect to the history on intra-session recess appointments, really if you look at the congressional directory, which is a document that we cite in our brief, and you look at the column that says intra-session recesses, you will see page after page of blank space until you get to the Civil War era when intra-session recesses become more frequent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5270.074" offset="21189327">And intra-session recess appointments really just precisely parallel the increasing use by the Senate of intra-session recesses.</text>

            <text syncTime="5293.523" offset="21283054">--Well, a couple of things about that, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5296.708" offset="21295802">The Pay Act, of course, was first enacted in this period, in the 1860s, when the first intra-session recess appointments occurred, in fact, even in its original form never said -- and since, never said anything about trying to restrict intra-session appointments.</text>
            <text syncTime="5312.736" offset="21359959">If the Congress felt that these were improper, they could have done what they did in the Tenure Of Office Act and passed a statute of making it a crime for somebody to take one of these appointments.</text>

Circuit ruling, you are really are writing the recess appointment power out of the Constitution, and that's antithetical to the liberty-enhancing properties of separation of powers that Madison described in Federals 51, because ambitions which counteract ambitions shouldn't disarm one side.</text>
