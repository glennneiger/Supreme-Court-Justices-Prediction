            <text syncTime="11.222" offset="150581">Marcus Burrage is serving a 20-year mandatory minimum sentence for selling heroin that, according to the jury instruction that was given to the jury at the time of the trial, was not the primary cause of the death, but, rather, merely played a part in the death.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.417" offset="215365">This lesser standard of contributing causation was neither articulated by Congress within the words of the statute, nor was it generally accepted at the time the statute was passed, as an acceptable version of causation.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.943" offset="277432">Congress's selection of the word “ results ” instead should be interpreted to mean the traditional notions of causation; those of factual cause or but-for cause and proximate cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.437" offset="331453">Now, the parties don't disagree that “ results in ” means causation.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.440" offset="363427">That it's a causation analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.456" offset="371577">And regardless of whether you look to the common law or the treatises or the legal commentators, causation triggers, at the very minimum, a but-for causation analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.614" offset="420165">In this particular case, but for the use of the heroin, the victim would not have died.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.268" offset="442735">Now, the Solicitor General suggests a lesser causation standard, one that expands the notion of but-for causation.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.623" offset="480246">But if we instead look to the case law and this Court's precedent, we are not actually trying to expand but-for causation in most cases, we are trying to limit it.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.265" offset="526744">Because but-for causation can be extrapolated beyond what we are willing to give liability for.</text>

            <text syncTime="3419.826" offset="13785037">It's our position that but-for cause is the first question, and only when you reach a point where there is no but-for cause do you then go on to say, is this one of these circumstances where there is a -- two independently sufficient harms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.803" offset="13860896">If no, end of question, which was the motion for judgment of acquittal at the time of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.024" offset="13881794">There was no but-for cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.543" offset="13887855">We made the motion for judgment of acquittal on but-for cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.159" offset="13898304">You don't need to make that inquiry in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.213" offset="13914604">There may be cases where you make that inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.399" offset="13923277">Of course, we didn't win, so we had to keep going along, and we asked for a substantial factor test because we thought maybe we could influence the judge to give us a better instruction, like the substantial factor test that the Eighth Circuit had already approved, and he rejected it and gave them a contributing cause instruction, which is clearly not encompassed within the common law standards of causation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.960" offset="14001539">But-for cause is substantial factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.078" offset="14010003">Now, to address the concerns about letting defendants go free, that just simply doesn't play a part in this analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.434" offset="14043440">Every criminal defendant in any of these hypotheticals would have some sort of criminal liability, either a lesser included offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.522" offset="14071757">This particular defendant, Mr. Burrage, could go to prison for 20 years for the lesser included offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.761" offset="14100700">You have accomplice liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.078" offset="14110000">You have conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.230" offset="14114597">You have attempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.030" offset="14117837">All of these individuals are going to be punished.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.264" offset="14126718">You have sentencing discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.915" offset="14133406">The judge can look at the fact that there was a death -- well, maybe not a primary cause in the death -- there was a death, and enhance the sentence under the -- beyond the guideline range.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.989" offset="14173634">All of those concerns are already addressed in the criminal law, and we do not need to change the criminal law of causation and relax it to encompass more harms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.945" offset="14213445">Because if we aren't willing to do that in a civil context where you have contributing negligence and shifting of burdens of -- shifting of the costs in having -- your hypothetical, you have different percentages' likelihood of causing the harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.957" offset="14277497">So maybe you give 5 percent to the marijuana dealer and 10 percent to the oxycodone dealer and 20 percent to the heroin dealer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.043" offset="14305918">We don't have that in criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.728" offset="14312606">That's a -- that's a policy consideration that is different between civil law and criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.714" offset="14332563">In criminal law, the person's going to go to prison under a mandatory minimum sentence, and in some cases for life with no parole based on this relaxed causation standard that the government is asking this Court to incorporate into a statute where it doesn't say it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.224" offset="14390555">And so we would respectfully ask for the Court not to engage in that process, not to relax causation for the criminal -- criminal statute at play here and in all of the criminal statutes that use “ result in ”, and instead rely upon the general notions of causation that are already established in the law.</text>
