            <text syncTime="12.138" offset="155137">This case involves an accrual provision in an ERISA plan that starts the clock running on a Federal denial of benefits claim near the beginning of ERISA's mandatory internal claims process before the Federal claim ever exists or could be filed in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.248" offset="219607">This provision directly conflicts with ERISA's two-tiered remedial structure, which is designed to maximize the number of claims that are resolved internally without lawyers in courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.955" offset="262448">The Respondent's provision undermines this goal by making it impossible for anyone to know in advance how much time will be left on the limitations clock after the internal process is complete.</text>

            <text syncTime="113.469" offset="560453">One of the key questions with these provisions, when they're coupled with the mandatory exhaustion requirement, that is -- that is actually quite uncertain when proof of loss is due.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.625" offset="597129">And so below, one -- one of the key questions which actually still remains unresolved is when the clock actually started ticking.</text>

            <text syncTime="132.445" offset="636417">I thought the court below said that that was irrelevant to the resolution of this case, that even if they accepted your date for when the proof of loss started, that you would still lose.</text>

            <text syncTime="181.578" offset="832963">But at least the advantage of proof of loss, you know you got three years from at least the beginning of the process.</text>

            <text syncTime="187.899" offset="858249">Right, although I -- there's actually quite a bit of disagreement among the lower courts about how you measure proof of loss, when that date actually triggers the limitations clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.603" offset="893044">So, for instance, in the Seventh Circuit, the court has held the proof of loss starts the clock ticking the first time proof of loss is due under the plan, which is the first set of documents that a claimant actually provides to her plan supporting her claim for disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.245" offset="947588">The plan, however, through this internal process, can come back and ask for more documents, more evidence supporting the disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.518" offset="980711">And if the claimant then provides those additional documents, that could conceivably reset the limitations clock under this proof of loss requirement.</text>

            <text syncTime="2203.168" offset="8919323">Justice Ginsburg, that's actually not correct, and we've provided some examples at pages 20 to 21 of the red brief that show how these provisions do commonly work in the traditional insurance context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.742" offset="8969583">And what you commonly see is a limitation period, often about 12 months, that will run from the time of the insured loss, let's say the time of the fire in a fire insurance policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.764" offset="9009707">What subsequently must happen within that 12 months is that the claimant must present proof of loss within the 12 months as the clock is ticking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.220" offset="9047532">Sometimes they must await the insurer's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.505" offset="9060594">Sometimes they simply have a waiting period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.924" offset="9070311">And then they have to file suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.893" offset="9078148">And that was the -- that was the scheme that this Court discussed at some length in the Wolfe case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.697" offset="9097374">And what that model is about is -- I mean, I think we're all very familiar with the kind of federal administrative scheme where there are several steps of administrative review, followed by a judicial review step, where Congress writes a limitation period that's essentially a grant of time in which a claimant can proceed from one step to the next.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.108" offset="9175010">But that's not the only model, and it's not the model that characterizes the insurance practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.245" offset="9195594">With that model -- the way that often works is there is a deadline out there in the future, and by that deadline a claimant must complete the pre-litigation steps necessary and file their claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.970" offset="9242510">That's the type of model that this court also considered in enforcing the McMahon case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.105" offset="9259020">And there's nothing in the law that says one model versus the other is the only way a limitation period can ever be written.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.194" offset="9287336">And in ERISA, Congress did not step in to decide what it thought the limitation period ought to be or how it thought it ought to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.265" offset="9319624">It instead said, number one, we want to defer to State insurance regulators; even though these provisions had long been on the books already, we want to defer to State insurance regulators to govern the content of insured plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.357" offset="9376048">And number two, we want to defer to employers' decisions about the terms on which they want to enter into the voluntary undertaking of providing benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.665" offset="9421292">And it is a voluntary undertaking and Congress, speaking about concerns about uncertainty and so on, the primary uncertainty that Congress was worried about and that would be visited on employers and insurers if this Court were to -- were to rule for Ms. Heimeshoff, would be that we don't want to be in a legal regime where every term in an ERISA plan is potentially unenforceable because someone can imagine a handful of five or nine cases in which it's unfair.</text>

            <text syncTime="3550.028" offset="14306713">A rule running from final denial, which I should say is the consistent rule across the board in every Federal statutory regime, stated -- going back from -- to the beginning of the law that we have been able to find, runs the limitations clock from when you can file the claim in court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3566.654" offset="14373168">Well, if we agree with you, would the Federal courts and maybe ultimately this Court in the end have to specify what the statute of limitations is, the length of time?</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.843" offset="14405978">So we have a bunch of cases from different courts, and one circuit says 2 years is -- is the -- that's the shortest you can have.</text>

            <text syncTime="3598.876" offset="14502109">They specify a lot of different lengths, and then they're all challenged -- different ones are challenged in different courts, and the courts have to say what's reasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="3616.070" offset="14570863">First, I don't think that's actually correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.106" offset="14579013">Most plans that run the length only do about a one year from -- from final denial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.660" offset="14601270">As Respondents themselves have -- have explained, and we agree, courts across the board find one year in almost every context to be reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.414" offset="14632303">And so it would automatically be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.266" offset="14639617">But the difference also is in the type of reasonableness inquiry that a court would have to apply in -- in the case that you're suggesting, which is not a fact-specific inquiry based on how long the parties took to pursue this internal process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.441" offset="14696355">It's simply an objective question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3648.925" offset="14702311">Is the amount of time on the limitations clock enough to allow a Plaintiff to file her claim in court?</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.295" offset="14727807">And one month -- excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.145" offset="14735225">One year from final denial would absolutely be enough time, would provide all parties under ERISA with the certainty that they have to -- to file their claim.</text>
