            <text syncTime="10.222" offset="146402">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.158" offset="158104">Under this Court's decision in Wolens, there are only two relevant questions here, and the Ninth Circuit got both of them wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.712" offset="184331">The first question is whether a claim for additional benefits under a frequent flyer program, like flight upgrades, relate to prices, routes and services.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.519" offset="223619">This Court answered that question in the affirmative in Wolens and, indeed, underscored the questions not particularly close.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.006" offset="249533">The Ninth Circuit's ability to reach the contrary conclusion in the precise same context underscores how far they have strayed from this Court's precedence.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.177" offset="282238">The second question is whether the Plaintiffs' claim here seek merely to enforce the parties' voluntary undertakings or, rather, seek to enforce State law to enlarge those undertakings and enlarge the parties' bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.253" offset="334483">And it's to that question 2 we think Respondent's own claims here make the case quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.990" offset="357471">Respondent did bring a claim here to enforce the parties' voluntary undertakings, a breach of contract claim and lost on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.744" offset="388504">The implied preemption claim is different.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.112" offset="397908">It seeks to impose a duty of fair dealing and reasonableness and superimposed that on the bargain, even where the parties to the contract have essentially given one party absolute discretion.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="85.087" offset="445869">Mr. Clement, the argument was made that if -- if the airline has an unreviewable right to terminate this agreement for any reason or for no reason, if that is so, then it's an illusory contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.983" offset="525386">What -- what is your answer to that, if one party can get out willy-nilly, why -- what kind of bargain is it?</text>

            <text syncTime="115.772" offset="568540">Well, there are a couple of answers to that, Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.207" offset="578362">The first is I think although the focus on whether a contract is illusory is sometimes used as part of the analysis under the implied covenant for a bilateral contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.747" offset="616501">I don't think that same analysis would apply to something like a frequent flyer program, which I think would be properly understood as a unilateral contract, where you don't worry about those sort of illusory promises.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.621" offset="655998">The second thing is I think you have to understand in the context--</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="144.191" offset="682225">There -- there is a distinction, if you go back to the Horne books on contract law between a unilateral contract and a bilateral contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.678" offset="708243">A unilateral contract is -- is a typical sort of outstanding promise, that promise doesn't require an exchange of consideration, and the party who makes the promise has the ability to withdraw the promise until there's -- there's performance essentially relying on the promise.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.938" offset="765295">And that's why I think it's actually a little bit of a mistake to apply that doctrine to something like a frequent flyer program.</text>

            <text syncTime="171.026" offset="789641">I guess I don't understand that, Mr. Clement, because I always thought that the way these agreements worked were there were agreements that if I flew a certain number of miles on your plan, I was going to get a free ticket.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.984" offset="837393">And -- and it wasn't a gift that I was getting a free ticket, it was because I did something, I flew a certain number of miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.672" offset="868217">So that there was an exchange with value on both sides.</text>

            <text syncTime="193.707" offset="880338">Well, I -- I suppose you could conceive of it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.076" offset="893817">You could also conceive of it as basically being a premium that's offered by the company to reward your loyalty, but you've already gotten full performance.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>

            <text syncTime="204.847" offset="924850">I think you have to conceive of it that way, but that still makes it a unilateral contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.115" offset="937912">It's not a promise in exchange for another promise.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.836" offset="952854">It's a promise in exchange for the performance of an act; that is, flying the airline, you know, a certain number of miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.823" offset="984828">You're correct, it is a -- a unilateral contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.875" offset="996948">Now, whether that -- that means that there's no -- is there no such thing as an illusory unilateral contract?</text>

            <text syncTime="233.099" offset="1037908">You know, I looked at the -- the treatises for that, and I just don't think that concept really applies in the unitary -- the unilateral contract context.</text>

            <text syncTime="241.688" offset="1072286">Because if I knew that it was really up to you to give me the free ticket, maybe I was willing to get it and maybe I wasn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.259" offset="1098513">I don't think that I'd be spending all this time in the air on your planes.</text>

            <text syncTime="256.865" offset="1132994">That really, I think, gets to the nub of this, because, of course, what you're suggesting is that there would be a market solution to this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.519" offset="1159535">And that's what the Airline Deregulation Act is all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.637" offset="1172073">Letting the market decide these issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.403" offset="1179074">So if some airline really were crazy enough to systematically turn on its most lucrative and loyal customers, surely, the market would solve that.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.326" offset="1210839">And, of course, if a bunch of airlines did it, the Department of Transportation stands ready to police that.</text>

            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="281.980" offset="1233409">But usually what we say when a contract has no consideration, we don't say, oh, we're going to hold you to it anyway because the market will solve it.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.169" offset="1266219">We say the contract has no consideration, it's illusory, in just the way that Justice Ginsburg pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.156" offset="1290147">And the question is: If there's really no obligation on the part of the airline here to give that free ticket, if they can do it when they feel like it and not do it when they don't feel like it, why is there any consideration?</text>
            <text syncTime="309.547" offset="1343646">Why isn't the contract not illusory?</text>

            <text syncTime="311.515" offset="1351587">There -- there is consideration -- I'm not sure anything turns on this -- but there is consideration because this is not something where the airline says, look, we can do anything we want.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.271" offset="1382620">They say, look, if you present us with miles while you're still in good standing in the program, we'll give you upgrades, we'll let you into a lounge.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.127" offset="1418042">But if, pursuant to the contract, you abuse the program in our sole discretion, then you lose your membership status.</text>

            <text syncTime="347.006" offset="1493484">But I suppose the argument might be that you could, as a matter of breach of contract law, use this principle to interpret the contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="359.480" offset="1543430">The claim here is not whether he abused or didn't abuse the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.384" offset="1563074">His allegation is that the only reason you terminated with a contract was because you wanted to get rid of these high flyers in your merger negotiations with the other airline.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.375" offset="1611035">That's the same as saying they didn't terminate me because I abused the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.512" offset="1631515">They terminated me because I was of a certain race or I was a woman or I was handicapped or some other improper consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.784" offset="1668609">So are you suggesting that this contract permits you to use that kind of self -- that kind of ground, one not grounded in the contract, but grounded in your whim and caprice?</text>

            <text syncTime="409.496" offset="1743528">First of all, I think it's -- it's really important to emphasize that the claim about pretext and this all being about the merger is actually not something that's made in the breach of contract count or the breach of implied covenant count.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.054" offset="1789713">That's pled actually in the misrepresentation counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.939" offset="1801206">Counts 3 and 4 of the complaint that everybody recognizes are preemptive.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.577" offset="1819806">Now, what's pled in contract Count 1, the breach of contract count, is that under the contract, somehow we don't have the ability to terminate somebody without just cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.765" offset="1860557">And that's the argument that the district court rejected on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.734" offset="1876439">Now, the implied covenant count, Count 2, is different.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.121" offset="1890023">It says that under State law, there is a duty of good faith and fair dealing and that duty is superimposed on the contract even if the contract gives one of the parties absolute discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.327" offset="1934849">And those aren't my words.</text>

            <text syncTime="3235.988" offset="13049428">The Department of Transportation does have authority over unfair and deceptive practices by airlines, but this is -- that's very different than the claim that we're pursuing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.546" offset="13099688">That's a claim by an airline -- sorry, by the government, that doesn't give remedies to the specific consumer who was hurt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.986" offset="13137409">And that also looks at whether the practice is unfair or deceptive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.854" offset="13152873">And our claim here isn't that this was an unfair practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.342" offset="13166875">The claim here is that this is a practice or these were actions that violated the contract and what's being applied here are contract law principles about interpreting the covenant of good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.131" offset="13210029">And the same thing was true also in Wolens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.867" offset="13228942">At the time of Wolens, the Department of Transportation had the same ability to pursue claims for unfair or deceptive practices, but the Court recognized that that did not override the need for there to be a contract dispute resolution regime by the State courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.896" offset="13305115">And that's the same -- the same is true here whether or not the contract term at issue is expressed or implied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.067" offset="13329775">And overall, like in Wolens, this is claim where if these sort of claims were preempted it would undercut the efficiency of contracts and the competitive marketplace that overall the ADA is meant to pursue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.909" offset="13389125">People need to be able to rely on their contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.344" offset="13398842">They need to be able to rely on the fact that the other party to their contract will interpret that contract in good faith according to the reasonable expectations of the parties where they will give them the performance they reasonably thought that they were securing when they entered into the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.740" offset="13468433">Under Northwest's position here, though, that it has the discretion not to perform at all, people won't be able to rely on the security of their contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.948" offset="13509288">And it's hard to imagine that when Congress enacted the Airline Deregulation Act it meant to undercut the efficiency of contracts in that way.</text>

            <text syncTime="3404.832" offset="13724850">First just a couple of loose ends.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.482" offset="13731433">The concession that I was referring to before is on Page 15 and 16 of the red brief, I think it was reiterated at the podium.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.236" offset="13754421">Also this argument that somehow frequent flyer miles programs have changed or something and are different because there are partners, the same arguments were made by the plaintiffs in Wolens in their brief to this Court that somehow these don't relate to prices and routes and services because you have rental cars and hotels as partners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.214" offset="13826310">So I think this Court has already crossed that bridge.</text>

            <text syncTime="3432.916" offset="13837177">I don't want to take up your rebuttal time, but if the facts were that under a particular program 90 percent of the miles were earned by purchasing things other than flying and 90 percent of the miles were spent on things other than flying, wouldn't that be very different?</text>

            <text syncTime="3448.259" offset="13898513">--I'm not sure it would be different in a claim brought against the airlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.496" offset="13915440">I mean, maybe if you want to sue the credit card partner, the ADA has nothing to do with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.115" offset="13929964">But I would say that if you're suing an airline, the Airline Deregulation Act speaks to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.169" offset="13946160">But if the Court want to reserve THAT, I suppose it could.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.552" offset="13955668">I do want to make -- underscore that the implied covenant doctrine is very different from other interpretative tools.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.739" offset="13976462">It is non-waivable and, I think, in a world where you are trying to determine the difference between self-imposed undertakings and things imposed by State law, non-waivability is a huge strike against it being voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.881" offset="14020975">It also just is, you can bring in separate implied covenant claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.248" offset="14038529">You know, no one -- I've never heard of a contra proferentem claim, but implied covenant claim is routinely brought as a separate claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.502" offset="14063502">It just shows you really can enlarge the bargain in very real ways, and the States make policy decisions about whether to have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.775" offset="14092550">Texas doesn't have implied covenants as a general matter at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.127" offset="14106029">Some States have a valid public policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.496" offset="14115433">They have different views about at-will employment contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.781" offset="14128599">And when Congress wanted to impose a duty of good faith and fair dealing on the franchise agreements between car manufacturers and automobile dealers, they passed a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.970" offset="14165379">It's just statutory and policy oriented in a way that normal rules of construction are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.791" offset="14184710">Now, Justice Breyer, I certainly agree with your four premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.242" offset="14198503">If I had to state a standard, I would say the standard is that the implied covenant is only not preempted when it does no more than provide a rule of construction for the express terms of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.550" offset="14243642">But, of course, if that's all it does, then there's nothing to be gained by saying those claims are not preempted because you can still just get to the same place by citing Cardozo and Lady Duff-Gordon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.025" offset="14289618">And there's a lot to be gained by adopting a more prophylactic rule because the claims that are brought in the real world are claims that I get a refund even though the ticket's nonrefundable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.964" offset="14325353">I get $1,000 even though the loss limit was 500.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.999" offset="14337474">I get to sue you for redirecting my packages even though it was in your sole discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.618" offset="14355969">So in the real world, the implied covenant claims are elastic and provide a basis for bringing the kind of claims that courts have almost uniformly correctly recognized are preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.906" offset="14393167">The last question I ask you to think about is: Why is it the airlines don't put these covenants in as express covenants?</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.710" offset="14416364">Why do they say sole discretion and not say sole discretion unless it violates reasonable norms of community standards and decency?</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.150" offset="14442068">Well, the reason is you can't run a national, let alone international airline, if every one of your judgments about taking an unruly passenger off or taking out an abusive customer is going to be second-guessed by a jury applying reasonable standards of ordinary decency and morality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.510" offset="14507584">So for that reason, we think the judgment below should be reversed and we would urge you to apply a more prophylactic rule.</text>
