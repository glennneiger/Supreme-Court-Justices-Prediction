            <text syncTime="14.574" offset="165799">The Stanford Ponzi scheme was a massive fraud, but that fraud clearly included material misrepresentations about transactions in covered securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.981" offset="207490">The complaints in this case bear that out.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.750" offset="218566">Plaintiffs allege specifically that their money was -- there were misrepresentations about how their money would be invested in covered securities, that the misrepresentation was material, and that indeed, the security of the underlying investments was the most important factor in securing Plaintiff's own investments in the CDs.</text>

            <text syncTime="49.264" offset="304561">I -- I think there's some problem with whether or not this was covered securities, but I also think that's not in the case anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.501" offset="329534">Am I correct in the latter assumption?</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="58.453" offset="341342">Well, I certainly agree with you in the latter assumption, Your Honor, which is both lower courts decided this on the case that the complaint specifically -- referred to covered securities specifically enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.559" offset="377809">I don't want to belabor the point because I don't think it's in the case, but I will say I do think there's a reason that that was not a contested issue because if you think about the securities that were referred to, strong multinational corporations, major international banks, those are companies that are traded on U.S. national exchanges.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.536" offset="449698">Also, if you get into the details of the record, I mean, I think if you want to look at something, Joint Appendix Page 746 is an attachment to the Willis complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.290" offset="480731">And there, there's a reference to the New York Stock Exchange and it's a translated letter to investors and you can read it more than one way.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.463" offset="513436">But I sure think the whole point of that paragraph is to lead the Plaintiffs to think that their stock -- they're buying an interest in stocks that would be traded on the New York Stock Exchange particularly.</text>

            <text syncTime="111.319" offset="552829">So if -- if I'm trying to get a home loan and they ask you what assets you have and I list a couple of stocks and, in fact, it's fraudulent, I don't own them, that's a covered transaction, that's a 10(b)(5) violation?</text>

            <text syncTime="125.528" offset="609671">That would depend on the answer to a question that I don't think the Court has to decide in this case, which is whether a reference to your stockholdings would be sufficient to -- to come with--</text>

            <text syncTime="145.842" offset="690965">And I don't think that's any great surprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.542" offset="697756">I mean, this Court held in a case called Reuben against the United States that if you pledge securities that are -- and tell the banks that they're valuable and they, in fact, aren't, that that's covered by the securities law.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.581" offset="737880">In that case, it wasn't just in connection with, it was actually considered a constructive sale or transfer of the securities.</text>

            <text syncTime="165.154" offset="768182">I mean, you're -- you're pledging covered securities to the bank and make a misrepresentation about them, right?</text>

            <text syncTime="173.075" offset="799843">I'm just saying, though, that I don't think the fact that you can have a misrepresentation in connection with a loan application or something like that is all that surprising in the sense that the way that both 10(b), 10(b)(5) and SLUSA are structured.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.083" offset="851879">The “ in connection with ” requirement can take something that might otherwise be plain fraud and if there's a misrepresentation in connection with a security or a covered security, that makes it securities fraud.</text>

            <text syncTime="200.426" offset="909244">I mean, every State has laws that forbid fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.478" offset="929410">And mortgages are probably -- and loans are probably made in the billions every year.</text>

            <text syncTime="307.828" offset="1338906">Our theory here does not, by any means, necessarily have to extend to those holder situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.199" offset="1360326">What is at issue here is not just a misrepresentation about holdings of securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.167" offset="1380179">It is -- they are misrepresentations about covered securities transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.721" offset="1398465">And more particularly, they are false promises to purchase covered securities for Plaintiffs' benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.208" offset="1424378">And there are SEC cases that are brought under those circumstances and as well there should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.695" offset="1446321">Because when you sell something, whether it's a noncovered security or something else based on a misrepresentation about covered securities, you trigger the interests of the SEC and SLUSA in a distinct way.</text>

            <text syncTime="760.284" offset="3148669">Let me start with -- I mean -- with a hypothetical that Zandford used because I think it helps illustrate why even if coincide is the test, we satisfy it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.206" offset="3180329">What Zandford was really distinguishing was two cases: One where a broker/dealer gets money from a potential client with the purest of intentions and only at a later stage do they say, you know, I'm kind of below on own payments, I need some money, I'm going to embezzle the funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.880" offset="3239053">And Zandford said, in that context, the fraud and the security purchases are independent events.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.386" offset="3265071">I don't think anybody would look at this case and say that the misrepresentations about covered securities purchases and the fraud were independent events, nor would anybody say that this isn't a case where from the very beginning there was intent by Stanford not to make good on the promise to purchase covered securities on behalf of the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.049" offset="3347722">So this is like Zandford itself or Wharf -- Wharf Holdings itself, where the fraudulent intent is there at the very moment the transaction takes place.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.489" offset="3385547">And again, Wharf Holdings is another example where this Court says in dictum that, you know, it would be one thing if they sold the option and only later independently decided that they weren't going to perform on the option.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.128" offset="3428075">But if they had that intent all along, they clearly coincide.</text>

            <text syncTime="1628.923" offset="6623268">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.659" offset="6638210">I would ask you to write an opinion affirming and that it adopts the following rule, and that is, that a false promise to purchase securities for one's self in which no other person will have an interest is not a material misrepresentation in connection with the purchase or sale of covered securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.920" offset="6703203">The other side has asked you to adopt a rule that has never been advocated by the SEC in any other proceeding; it's never been advocated, as I understand it, in its briefs in this case; it's never been adopted by any Court ever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.311" offset="6752836">And I think there are good reasons for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.561" offset="6761822">Their theory is that what happened here is that there was a promise to buy covered securities that would be for the benefit of someone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.300" offset="6796721">That has two textual flaws, it doesn't comport with the purpose of the statute, and it would have extraordinary consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.889" offset="6827128">It doesn't -- it doesn't conform to the text of the statute in either of two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.343" offset="6844891">Covered security, which is what the Plaintiffs here purchased, is a defined term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.411" offset="6865162">It is a security, but only the subset of securities that are traded on a national exchange and some of the other additions that would involve, for example, mutual funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.686" offset="6906331">And so Congress didn't say that it was in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security if it was a covered security that someone else would get the benefit of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.842" offset="6950948">It is -- what has to be bought here is a stock, and instead, what was bought here was a CD.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.914" offset="6979160">As Mr. Clement says, this is a case of a massive fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.949" offset="6991386">He could well have said, this is a case of a massive securities fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.568" offset="7005805">But it was not a case of a covered securities fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.203" offset="7020329">The Plaintiffs here bought something that Congress specifically excluded from preclusion under SLUSA.</text>

            <text syncTime="1814.578" offset="7365877">The problem with their position is that what the Court has always said when it talked about the definition of “ in connection with ” is really two things.</text>

            <text syncTime="1990.575" offset="8069825">And that was going to be the second textual flaw that I was going to point out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.777" offset="8082677">And that is, we can acknowledge that they would have a much stronger case in the hypothetical that you've described if the covered securities are pledged to back the CDs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.398" offset="8125100">This happens, for example, on a margin account.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.350" offset="8132937">It happens if -- there are lots of times someone will say: I intend to use your money to buy covered securities, to buy stocks, and I am providing those stocks as security for the loan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.308" offset="8180793">The reason that is securities fraud is the definition of a purchase includes pledging the -- pledging the stocks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.414" offset="8213185">That's really important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.664" offset="8218200">And it tracks with the Court's holding that “ in connection with ” reaches as far as frauds that would have an effect on the regulated market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.270" offset="8248607">Imagine if I were allowed to say: Look, I am going to buy covered securities and you now hold an interest in them, an enforceable interest in the stocks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.709" offset="8286432">And if that were not securities fraud, the market couldn't function very well, because things like margin accounts, you could never have the confidence that you would have the protection of 10(B)5.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.815" offset="8322795">The critical difference, Justice Kennedy, is between two different cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.800" offset="8338782">If -- this case, which is SIB, says, look -- among all of its many misrepresentations -- I will take your money and I intend to buy covered securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.924" offset="8383294">That gets the -- you know, putting all aside the difficulty of liquid assets versus covered securities, give them their best version of the representation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.678" offset="8414223">But it was only buying it for itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.380" offset="8425090">It did not pledge to sell the assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.015" offset="8439614">It did not give the plaintiffs any interest in them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.500" offset="8449541">For example, the interest rate on the CDs was completely independent of the return on those covered securities.</text>

            <text syncTime="2114.969" offset="8567405">The Fifth Circuit undertook to articulate a rule that would govern all cases in which someone purchased something that was supposedly invested in covered securities; so including, for example the Madoff cases where there was securities fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.713" offset="8622367">Madoff falsely sold interest in a fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.415" offset="8633234">That's core securities fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.015" offset="8639608">SIB never sold any securities at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="2151.910" offset="8715154">But we think this case court stands on its own on the question of, look, if I promise -- if I sell you something and I say I am going to take the money and buy CDs for myself and those CDs have the quality of being liquid -- now you don't have an interest in the CDs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.669" offset="8774191">I am not pledging them to you, so there is no purchase by you of a covered security -- then that is not a securities fraud.</text>

            <text syncTime="2982.103" offset="12035944">And so we are going to say that the preclusive effect of SLUSA does not reach these things like the CDs that we leave to regulation by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.273" offset="12064679">So this case clearly falls very easily within the text of SLUSA as being not precluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.527" offset="12089652">Then you ask: Well, am I going to stretch the language of the statute to say, well, even though these are noncovered CDs, because securities were involved, I think SLUSA should still apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.299" offset="12128731">In asking whether you should stretch the language, you would say, well, what's the point of the phrase “ in connection with ”?</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.120" offset="12152032">Why did Congress give it that kind of capacious reading, but didn't say fraud about securities or fraud involving securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.876" offset="12183066">It did say “ in connection with ”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.059" offset="12187768">And what your precedents have said over and over and over and what has been the dividing line that has prevented 10(b)(5) from swallowing all fraud is these are misrepresentations that affect the regulated market negatively.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.784" offset="12234684">This fraud did not do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.986" offset="12243461">If there are no further questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3042.308" offset="12276793">First of all, it is just simply wrong that courts have not decided that a purported sale is covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.395" offset="12305110">The Grippo case from the Eleventh Circuit, which we cite in both our opening and reply brief is one of those cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="3069.308" offset="12384731">I don't know that I would adopt any of them, Your Honor, because I think a lot of them make the same mistake, which is they get materiality, and they sneak it into the “ in connection with ” requirements.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="3081.866" offset="12434991">--Yes, and I think if you were going to accept one test, I would accept -- I would ask you to have the Siegel test from Judge Sutton.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.103" offset="12455993">But I do think it's a mistake to have materiality or causation slip into the “ in connection with ” requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.924" offset="12479294">I'd like to start with Justice Kennedy's very apt observation that this fraud here is very similar to the paradigmatic securities fraud where I simply -- a broker simply says, give me your money; I will buy securities, and never does it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.564" offset="12529763">And from the perspective of the defrauded party, it doesn't matter whether what they get in return is a statement that says they own some securities or a statement in a feeder fund that says they have an interest in the Madoff fund, or whether they get here a CD that they are told by the brochure that tells them what this is all about that it's backed by the investments in the securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.264" offset="12620565">They're all one and the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.297" offset="12624744">Another thing I have to correct is it's simply not true that the returns here were not variable on the performance of the portfolio.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.934" offset="12651285">It's not really well developed in the record here, but if you want to, we could lodge the brochures that are used to market these things that tell these guys that their returns are variable and that they could lose all their principal because of the investments in covered securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.343" offset="12704888">A second thing is, of course Mr. Goldstein correctly says there are particular problems when broker dealers lie about covered securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.349" offset="12736966">Well, so too there are particular problems when an unregistered investment company lies about covered securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.187" offset="12764342">And that's what their own complaint says was the reality of these -- of the Stanford Investment Bank, that it was an unregistered investment company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.709" offset="12798406">That's interesting for two reasons: One, if it were a registered investment company, all of its securities would be covered securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.713" offset="12826409">That's another way you can get within the covered security vane.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.329" offset="12836858">So this idea that Mr. Goldstein proclaims, this is not a covered securities fraud, is simply wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.335" offset="12864862">It is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.919" offset="12867265">It was material to this fraud to make misrepresentations about purchases of covered securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.256" offset="12892551">Without those representations that we're going to take their money and we're going to reinvest it -- again, words from their complaint -- in covered securities, nobody's going to give their money to a bank in Antigua.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.713" offset="12934347">The reason you give your money to a bank in Antigua is because you think it's backed by something more than a piece of paper, and the something more was purchases of covered securities on the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.752" offset="12978547">So--</text>

            <text syncTime="3218.438" offset="12981263">Even if you're right about that, Mr. Clement, they also said there was a representation that this is insured by Lloyds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.192" offset="13012297">And there was another claim that they made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.931" offset="13039255">So even -- even if you are right, wouldn't the answer be, okay, drop anything that has to do with</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.768" offset="13066631">"in connection with the sale or purchase of securities. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.469" offset="13081469">We have -- oh, we have a claim about the insurance, and we also have a claim that both Antigua and United States were heavily regulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.842" offset="13118876">Those were false.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.944" offset="13123369">Why couldn't they have a complaint shorn of the incorrect premise and based on the insurance and the regulated aspects?</text>

            <text syncTime="3267.335" offset="13176868">--If I can answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.021" offset="13183660">First of all, I think that Mr. Goldstein was quite prudent to not defend the Fifth Circuit's rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.925" offset="13207275">So the fact that there are other misrepresentations should not mean that a misrepresentation in connection with the purchase or sale of covered securities is somehow okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.944" offset="13239353">SLUSA makes clear that any misrepresentation is enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.380" offset="13249071">Now, the other thing I would say, very briefly, is that they may have an opportunity to try to replead.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.550" offset="13273730">That in a sense is the next case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.319" offset="13280836">I assure you that we would be arguing here, where the essence of their claim is to hold the petitioners secondarily liable for the underlying misrepresentations, they have to sort of have to take them all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.610" offset="13325975">But that's the next case.</text>
