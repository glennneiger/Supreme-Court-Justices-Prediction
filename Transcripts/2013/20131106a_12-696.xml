            <text syncTime="41.493" offset="271941">And the minister had asked everyone to stand and to bow their heads in prayer and the minister said the following: He said, we acknowledge the saving sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross.</text>

            <text syncTime="1533.614" offset="6240398">We think the other elements that the Respondents have pointed to for coercion are ones that trouble us because they are things that have analogs in our history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.886" offset="6277492">So, for example, they point to the presence of children.</text>

            <text syncTime="2577.328" offset="10415288">The downside is seeing supervised by a judge dozens of groups, and today, there are 60 or 70 groups of different religions coming in and saying, no, that doesn't work for us, this doesn't work for us, and that's the nightmare that they are afraid of.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.022" offset="10482057">I mean, even in this town or in the area, there are significant numbers, as well as Christians, of Jews, of Muslims, of Baha'is, of Hindus, and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.449" offset="10539735">So there's a third approach, and that is say, well, you can't have them if there's any aspect of coercion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2673.975" offset="10801900">Any rotation scheme will be dominated by the local majority, maybe even disproportionate to its numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.545" offset="10824156">Religious minorities -- unfamiliar minorities give the prayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.913" offset="10837635">There are often political protests; there are often threats and hate mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.782" offset="10853100">They don't want to give the prayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.015" offset="10858011">And many city councils won't stand up to the political pressure and enable those people to give the prayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.055" offset="10882148">So there are multiple reasons why rotation does not solve the problem here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.690" offset="10900747">We think nonsectarianism has a very long tradition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.411" offset="10919555">The government is not a competent judge of religious truth, Madison said, that was not a controversial proposition in the founding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.315" offset="10947245">And even in the first Congress, in the prayers they point to, there were no prayers there that violate our principle, invoking details in which believers disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.270" offset="10983085">Because then, 98-1/2 percent of the population was Protestant, Christ was not yet a point that disbelievers disagreed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3500.312" offset="14107226">That would be sectarian and unconstitutional under Respondent's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.399" offset="14123526">With respect to coercion, it's unquestionably true that there is less basis for claiming coercion here than there was in Marsh.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.322" offset="14155291">In Marsh, Senator Chambers was required to be on the Senate floor by rule, he had to be there to do his job and the practice was to stand every single time, which he did because he felt coerced to do it; whereas, here, the record suggests that there were three times when somebody requested people to stand out of 121 occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.164" offset="14218612">The idea that this is more coercive than Marsh is absurd.</text>

            <text syncTime="3538.806" offset="14261139">With respect to the history, as well, I think the debate in the Continental Congress, when this issue was first raised, shows what the American tradition has been.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.078" offset="14302308">That is Americans are not bigots and we can stand to hear a prayer delivered in a legislative forum by someone whose views we do not agree with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.749" offset="14328953">That is the tradition in this country, and that's why it doesn't violate the Establishment Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.720" offset="14344835">And finally, with respect to the fact that this is a municipality rather than a state or local -- Federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.057" offset="14374197">That can't possibly make a difference as an Establishment Clause matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.175" offset="14386631">It makes no sense to suggest that a prayer at the local level is more dangerous for Establishment Clause purposes than what Congress is doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.431" offset="14419650">Only Congress could establish a religion for the entire nation, which is the core preventive purpose of the Establishment Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.685" offset="14448698">To suggest that there are greater restrictions on municipalities makes no sense at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.739" offset="14468865">We think that the dangerously overbroad theories advanced by respondents are at odds with our history and traditions, which we reflect this tradition of tolerance for religious views that we don't agree with in the legislative context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.730" offset="14516930">Respondent's theories also conflict with the religion clauses mandate, that it's not the business of government to be regulating the content of prayer and regulating theological orthodoxy.</text>
