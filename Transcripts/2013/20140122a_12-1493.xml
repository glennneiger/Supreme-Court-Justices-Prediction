            <text syncTime="8.466" offset="141412">In 2009, Bruce Abramski went to a gun store at his home in Virginia and purchased a firearm.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.668" offset="166176">When he did so, he filled out all the required Federal paperwork providing his own name and identifying information and passing a background check.</text>

            <text syncTime="38.814" offset="262724">But despite doing precisely what Congress established as the process to buy a firearm, intending to sell or give it to a lawful gun owner in another State, the government charged Mr. Abramski with falsely stating that he was the actual buyer of the firearm when he acquired it.</text>

            <text syncTime="195.969" offset="891335">What Congress was concerned about was the starting point, because as part of the key political compromise of the Gun Control Act, there were two competing interests that needed to be accommodated.</text>

            <text syncTime="206.417" offset="933131">Let's say there's a man, Mr. Straw, and he holds himself out as a gun buyer, puts, you know, a website, creates a website.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.772" offset="974613">He puts something in the Yellow Pages under "Straw Man".</text>

            <text syncTime="228.737" offset="1022470">And so these people come to him and whenever they do, he goes to Joe's gun shop and -- with the other person.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.763" offset="1058519">He says, I want to buy a gun, but this fellow with me is going to do all the talking.</text>

            <text syncTime="276.233" offset="1212432">If you have truthful, accurate information about the first initial purchaser, the person who walks out of a gun store with a gun in their hand, then law enforcement has that starting point if they need to trace the firearm.</text>

            <text syncTime="716.149" offset="2972145">The government acknowledges that the statements on the form are just an interpretive rule and not even sort of ordinary interpretive rule that this Court may encounter with agency interpretations where they are looking at the statute, and although they have not been delegated with authority to rule make, they are interpreting the text of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.329" offset="3044870">Here the government acknowledges that the statement is an interpretation of the case law about the straw purchaser doctrine.</text>

            <text syncTime="754.743" offset="3126476">But, of course, when you have a case law question like this where there's a split, this Court is the authority that decides what the law should be.</text>

            <text syncTime="770.846" offset="3190842">The primary object of this statute is to keep guns out of hands of felons, of people with mental illness and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.421" offset="3221144">Now, it's absolutely true, as you have said, that Congress didn't do everything it could have to achieve that result, right?</text>
            <text syncTime="785.590" offset="3249879">That there are many kinds of resales that are allowable, that there are gifts that are allowable.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.213" offset="3272344">It's one thing to say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.182" offset="3280285">It's another thing to say that at the initial point of sale, which is where the entire system is set up, right, with the gun dealer doing the automatic checks, that at that initial point of sale, which is the centerpiece of this statute, that we will -- that we will essentially disregard fronts, that we -- you know, that we don't care that the person standing at the counter is a front.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.655" offset="3378088">I mean, that goes far beyond the other kinds of resale possibilities that you're talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.544" offset="3405673">And I guess what I want to know is why you think a Congress that was geared towards this object of keeping guns out of the hands of dangerous people and set up a mechanism that had the gun seller be the kind of enforcer, at the point of sale, would have thought, oh, it's fine if a front, if a straw walks in the door.</text>

            <text syncTime="845.629" offset="3489996">The reason, Your Honor, is because Congress understood that private sales -- that there was an importance to private sales between citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.937" offset="3527299">And in a straw purchase like this or -- or someone who's purchasing a gun intending to resell it to someone else, that is precisely what's happening is that second sale is a private transaction between two private citizens and Congress did not want any regulation of those types of sales.</text>

            <text syncTime="880.677" offset="3630221">But remember, too, that Congress was not operating in a vacuum.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.316" offset="3640775">It understood that, although there might not be a national consensus about some of these issues and, therefore, the regime that Congress chose may have some holes in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.578" offset="3673794">But the States could fill those holes if there was a State-wide consensus on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.529" offset="3689572">And many States have done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.091" offset="3695841">Some States have -- Hawaii, for example -- what is really a complete gun registration system.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.403" offset="3717157">And others, like West Virginia, believe that there should be virtually no regulation of these sorts of private sales at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.133" offset="3744011">And so I think the system is working precisely as Congress intended.</text>

            <text syncTime="1039.987" offset="4267505">And the concern there was Congress wanted to leave open two paths for gun buyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.110" offset="4283910">One is to physically be present at the gun store and fill out the papers yourself for the gun dealer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.499" offset="4301464">As you're writing your name and age and your height and eye color on the forms, there's a person there looking at you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.543" offset="4329676">And there was also an option that Congress provided for people to purchase a gun, for example, by telephone or mail or over the Internet without ever actually being present, with no person being present in the gun store.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.633" offset="4370009">And it was in that circumstance that Congress said we think we need a little bit more recordkeeping in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.912" offset="4399162">So that's why they required the affidavit, for example, and the -- the waiting period to provide extra time for local law enforcement and the background check.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.095" offset="4427897">But that's not the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.344" offset="4436883">Mr. Abramski was physically present at the gun store and so that provision of the statute is not even implicated here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.201" offset="4464259">Another point, Your Honors, is that the plain text interpretation of the statute is one that the agency, ATF, had adopted initially.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.056" offset="4515773">In 1979, the Agency sent a circular to gun dealers that took the -- the precise position that -- that Petitioner is taking here, which is that a purchase of a gun for another lawful gun owner is permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.628" offset="4566032">And in doing so, the -- the Agency said that that was an interpretation of the text of the Gun Control Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1152.503" offset="4717542">And Congress didn't use terms like "true buyer" or "true purchaser" or "actual buyer" because they are not concerned about the ultimate recipients of firearms or what happens to a gun after it leaves the gun store.</text>

            <text syncTime="1579.726" offset="6426368">His first argument is, in a sense, that there is no such thing as a straw purchaser doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.975" offset="6447371">I take that actually as a falsity argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.567" offset="6457820">He's saying when I answered that I was the purchaser, that was a true statement because I'm the only purchaser who counted for purposes of the statute, because I was the one standing there and I was the one filling out the form.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.157" offset="6500138">His second argument is an alternative argument, as I understand it, and he says, even assuming I'm wrong about the first argument and that this statement was false, that that falsehood was not material because my uncle was legally eligible to possess a firearm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.510" offset="6557503">So I'd like to take those two arguments in -- in order.</text>

            <text syncTime="1762.356" offset="7156961">So the provision says:</text>

            <text syncTime="1776.741" offset="7214430">This case isn't the first one in which the Court has had occasion to interpret those terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.910" offset="7231149">In Huddleston the Court looked at those terms, in particular "acquisition" and "disposition", and it said several things about those terms that are relevant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.626" offset="7266048">It said those terms are meant to have a practical, common sense meaning in terms of who will come into possession and control of a firearm as the result of a transaction with a federally regulated dealer, and they don't turn on formal notions of legal title; and that with respect to "disposition" in particular that Congress meant to give broad effect to this term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.803" offset="7358731">And so we think that the same kind of practical common sense inquiry is applicable here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1838.562" offset="7461758">Now, we look to see what section is it material to, and you say in your brief it's material to the section that says -- you have two of them, but they come to the same thing -- selling or delivering any firearm to any person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.226" offset="7516406">All right.</text>

            <text syncTime="1860.848" offset="7550888">They sold or delivered it to the straw, and that's the end of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.689" offset="7574293">And at least the statute is open to this interpretation, and it's a criminal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.595" offset="7593937">And besides, the ATF for a long time interpreted it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.030" offset="7611596">So what we should do is interpret it strictly.</text>

            <text syncTime="1884.699" offset="7646287">And so you have to get those words "sale" and "deliver" and explain how in a criminal statute they apply to what you're calling the real purchaser.</text>

            <text syncTime="2532.493" offset="10237529">And then if he's prosecuted for that false statement, he could defend, as the defendant in Crandall tried to defend, saying, well, it didn't really matter because I'm actually eligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.443" offset="10269294">So even if you'd known my true name and had my true nonforged ID, he would have sold me the gun, so it's not material.</text>

            <text syncTime="3148.268" offset="12700563">I think if -- if the Petitioner changed his mind and decided not to actually transfer it, I think, as a technical matter, that wouldn't affect the legality because what mattered was, was he making a purchase on behalf of another and entering a false statement at the time he made it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.715" offset="12754375">A fact question could arise in a -- in a situation like that, which a defendant could argue, I wasn't actually making the purchase on behalf of someone else, and that argument is supported by subsequent events.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.726" offset="12794395">But I think we were -- I was about to say that the one critical purpose of the statute, obviously, was to keep firearms out of the hands of ineligible persons, but another critical purpose was to offer the tracing of firearms and to prevent the anonymous stockpiling of firearms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.815" offset="12850715">And with respect to that purpose, I think the facts of some of the cases underlying the circuit split on the second issue of materiality are quite salient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.576" offset="12885823">Those are all cases in which eligible parties wanted to anonymously obtain large quantities of firearms for illicit reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.854" offset="12918946">They were eligible, but they had -- they wanted to not have their name associated with the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.993" offset="12939426">So Polk, which is the Fifth Circuit case, which is actually on Petitioner's side, that person wanted to anonymously acquire firearms to create a stockpile to attack an IRS building, to kill police officers, and to assassinate a judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.707" offset="12990313">But he was eligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.987" offset="12995433">In Frazier and Morales, which are the Eleventh and Sixth Circuit cases addressing this materiality issue, there were straw purchases on behalf of eligible buyers, but they were, again, wanting to anonymously stockpile weapons and not have their names associated with them because they were smuggling them out of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.637" offset="13058022">And the Petitioner's view of the statute in which a straw purchaser can satisfy the requirement that the first transaction, at the point of sale be recorded would completely satisfy the statutory requirements, would greatly impair the ability of ATF to trace firearms and to have an accurate record of who that first purchaser of the firearm was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.849" offset="13134927">If there are no further questions, we'd ask that the judgment of the court of appeals be affirmed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard D Dietz</label>
            <text syncTime="3264.673" offset="13166169">Justice Ginsburg, you asked counsel whether this was a case where there were two interpretations of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.027" offset="13219564">Counsel conceded that there were.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.479" offset="13225415">I think that's an important point because, of course, we're dealing with a criminal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.414" offset="13245164">If there are two interpretations under very well-settled precedent from this Court, the court applies the interpretation that's favorable to the criminal defendant and that's part of the doctrine of criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.614" offset="13285915">Justice Kennedy, you -- you mentioned the -- the agency situation that existed here between Mr. Abramski and his uncle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.846" offset="13318933">And here, I think it's important to note that there wasn't even any consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.328" offset="13332830">This was truly a purchase that was just a favor for a family member.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.531" offset="13345578">And the government, in order to advance this straw purchaser theory that historically came from civil common law, there needs to be a relationship between Mr. Abramski and his uncle that is a fiduciary relationship where Mr. Abramski is required to act in his uncle's best interests at all times.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.789" offset="13414646">And that, for example, if he left the gun store and someone said, hey, did you just pick up a Glock, I'll buy it for you for $500, that Mr. Abramski could not even enter into that sale without providing his uncle with -- with any money he made from that sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.830" offset="13466786">And there's -- there's a complex set of civil agency law principles that apply here that just don't translate to the straw purchaser doctrine as we've described it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.218" offset="13500328">And I think that's a fundamental flaw in the government's theory is that the courts just have never thought through all of the various situations that apply in these fiduciary relationships and how you would apply them to situations where you're just buying a gun for a family member or something of that nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.430" offset="13553199">I also wanted to turn to the gift exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.102" offset="13563962">There's also another exception the government acknowledges and that's for raffles and contests at charities or, you know, political fundraisers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.022" offset="13595622">And so in that circumstance, the person who's buying the gun knows that they're giving it to a complete stranger and someone who by random chance wins the right to own the gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.611" offset="13633970">But in those cases, the government says there's no need, at the time that you buy the gun, to take any steps to ensure there's recordkeeping or a background check on that person.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.826" offset="13666780">And I think that undermines this idea that everyone receiving a gun in the chain from the gun dealer Congress wants to have a background check.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.994" offset="13699485">Congress is concerned about providing enough information to allow for tracing and nothing more.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.024" offset="13719652">And as a final point, Your Honors, I think, perhaps, the most important point in this case is if the Court rejects the straw purchaser doctrine as it -- as it applies in this case to a lawful gun owner buying for another, there are really no harmful consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.924" offset="13771165">The government retains a very robust toolbox of criminal statutes to prosecute illegal straw purchasers, those who buy guns to get them into the hands of prohibited persons, and the government will receive accurate, truthful information about that first sale so they can trace firearms when they're used in the commission of a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.183" offset="13840233">So the only thing the straw purchaser doctrine in this case really accomplishes is to prohibit law-abiding citizens from buying guns for other law-abiding citizens, and that's something that Congress expressly chose not to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.037" offset="13891642">And we would ask this Court to remain faithful to the statutory scheme actually enacted by Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="3471.527" offset="13993624">And I think the government has suggested -- they provide an example of a circumstance where the -- the person who bought the gun was buying it for someone named, I believe, Almonio, who they had no idea who that was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.038" offset="14031658">But, yes, in that circumstance, the government would need to prove that that person was prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.912" offset="14047123">But I think in circumstances like that where you're buying guns for someone you don't even know who that person is, the government may well have evidence in that case that you either knew or had reasonable cause to believe that that person was prohibited from possessing a gun.</text>
