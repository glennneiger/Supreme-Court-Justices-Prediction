            <text syncTime="11.808" offset="153295">Bicker's aggregate contribution limits are an impermissible attempt to equalize the relative ability of individuals to participate in the political process.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.663" offset="188717">By prohibiting contributions that are within the modest base limits Congress has already imposed to combat the reality or appearance of corruption, these limits simply seek to prevent individuals from engaging in too much First Amendment activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.304" offset="247232">These limits cannot be justified on circumvention grounds because the concerns the Government hypothesizes are already addressed by Bicker's multitude of more direct anti-circumvention measures.</text>

            <text syncTime="312.035" offset="1354197">But what we're trying to do in both, I think, our cases is that we looked up all the rules and the regs -- or my law clerk did -- and -- and what she discovered, and it may be wrong because I'll look at it again, is there has been no significant change in the earmarking rules, in any of the rules that you're talking about, but for one, change since Buckley.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.234" offset="1446984">The one change, the one change is the change that all contributions made by political committees established by or financed or maintained or controlled by a single person will count as one.</text>

            <text syncTime="1051.802" offset="4313243">It has been argued that these limits promote expression, promote democratic participation, because what they require the candidate to do is, instead of concentrating fundraising on the super-affluent, the candidate would then have to try to raise money more broadly in the electorate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1643.022" offset="6678056">Aggregate limits combat corruption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.974" offset="6689864">Let me start by explaining exactly how.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.676" offset="6700730">Aggregate limits combat corruption both by blocking circumvention of individual contribution limits and, equally fundamentally, by serving as a bulwark against a campaign finance system dominated by massive individual contributions in which the dangers of quid pro quo corruption would be obvious and inherent and the corrosive appearance of corruption would be overwhelming.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.909" offset="6801668">Now, the Appellants in this case have tried to present the case as though the issue were whether there were some corrupting potential in giving contribution to the nineteenth candidate after someone has already contributed to -- the maximum to the eighteenth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.984" offset="6857988">But that is not what this case is about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.435" offset="6867705">The Appellants are not arguing that the aggregate limit is drawn in the wrong place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.989" offset="6885991">They are arguing that there can be no aggregate limit because the base contribution limits do all the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.310" offset="6911277">And so what that means is that you -- you're taking the lid off the aggregate contribution limit and, as Justice Kagan and her question earlier indicated, that means that an individual can contribute every two years up to $3.6 million to candidates for a party, party national committees and state committees--</text>

            <text syncTime="1723.057" offset="6998213">That's because they can transfer the funds among themselves and to a particular candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.128" offset="7018484">Is the possibility of prohibiting those transfers perhaps a way of protecting against that corruption appearance while at the same time allowing an individual to contribute to however many House candidates he wants to contribute to?</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.957" offset="7097792">I mean, the concern is you have somebody who is very interested, say, in environmental regulation, and very interested in gun control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.515" offset="7144081">The current system, the way the anti-aggregation system works, is he's got to choose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.801" offset="7165188">Is he going to express his belief in environmental regulation by donating to more than nine people there?</text>

            <text syncTime="1776.358" offset="7211477">--So, Mr. Chief Justice, I want to make two different points in response to that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.595" offset="7232375">The first is that restricting transfers would have a bearing on the circumvention problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.266" offset="7259124">It wouldn't eliminate all circumvention risk, but would have a bearing on that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.284" offset="7271140">But there is a more fundamental problem here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.986" offset="7282007">It's a problem analogous to the one that was at issue with soft money in McConnell, which is the very fact of delivering the $3.6 million check to the whoever it is, the Speaker of the House, the Senate Majority Leader, whoever it is who solicits that check, the very fact of delivering that check creates the inherent opportunity for quid pro quo corruption, exactly the kind of risk that the Court identified in Buckley, wholly apart from where that money goes after it's delivered.</text>

            <text syncTime="1821.505" offset="7392035">What is the framework -- what is the framework for analyzing -- I agree with you on the aggregation, but it has this consequence with respect to limiting how many candidates an individual can support within the limits that Congress has said don't present any danger of corruption?</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.349" offset="7459431">So what is the framework for analyzing that?</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.984" offset="7469984">Give you your argument with respect to the transfers and the appearance there, but it does have that other consequence on something we've recognized as a significant right.</text>

            <text syncTime="1855.910" offset="7529648">The specific point is this: The aggregate limit would have the effect of restricting the ability of a contributor to make the maximum contribution to more than a certain number of candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.486" offset="7583983">That's true.</text>

            <text syncTime="1872.405" offset="7595686">But that doesn't mean that that individual cannot spend as much as the individual wants on independent expenditures to try to advance the interest of those candidates or the interests or the causes that those candidates stand for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.282" offset="7651170">Mr. McCutcheon, for example, can spend as much of his considerable fortune as he wants on independent expenditure advocating the election of these candidates.</text>

            <text syncTime="2003.590" offset="8120329">I mean, as I understand it, the whole reason -- it is no doubt that campaign limits take an ordinary person and they say: You cannot give more than such-and-such an amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.298" offset="8167245">There are apparently, from the Internet, 200 people in the United States who would like to give $117,000 or more.</text>

            <text syncTime="2027.455" offset="8215833">That is a First Amendment negative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.640" offset="8220535">But that tends to be justified on the other side by the First Amendment positive, because if the average person thinks that what he says exercising his First Amendment rights just can't have an impact through public opinion upon his representative, he says: What is the point of the First Amendment?</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.471" offset="8303917">And that's a First Amendment point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.171" offset="8310709">All right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.423" offset="8315725">So that's basic, I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.856" offset="8321472">Now, once that's so, Congress has leeway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.659" offset="8340698">And you are saying, and I have seen all over the place, that that's why we don't want those 200 people to spend more than 117 or 120,000 because the average person thinks the election is -- after the election all the actions are affected by the pocketbook and not by the merits of the First Amendment arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.323" offset="8419274">Okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.857" offset="8421468">And now you say the person can do the same thing anyway; just call it independent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.775" offset="8437142">And what independent does, he can spend 40 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.061" offset="8450308">He can spend 50 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.596" offset="8456368">And all that does is sort of mix up the messages because the parties can't control it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.298" offset="8475176">Now, that's, I think, the question that's being asked.</text>

            <text syncTime="3490.804" offset="14069246">Just a few quick points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.256" offset="14074993">First, we haven't heard of the Solicitor General talk that much about circumvention today, and I think that's because the circumvention argument just doesn't really work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.593" offset="14108430">It's already addressed by all of the multiple prophylactic measures that Bicker contains.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.397" offset="14127552">And to the extent those aren't sufficient, there are much narrower, tailored ways to get at this, as the questions from Justice Alito and the Chief Justice pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.003" offset="14162033">What we're really hearing today is a corruption argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.038" offset="14174154">But as the questioning revealed, once you accept the corruption theory that the Government is putting forward here, there really isn't a way to continue to draw a line between independent expenditures and the $3 point million check to all of these different individuals that is in small based limited amounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.499" offset="14244058">Because there's certainly going to be just as much gratitude to the individual who spends $3.6 million directly supporting one candidate through ads on that candidate's behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.289" offset="14283137">So what we really have is a system that's forcing money out of the most transparent way possible to make contributions which is directly to the candidates and the parties and the PACs.</text>
